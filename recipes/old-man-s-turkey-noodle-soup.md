## Ingredients

- 3  turkey drumsticks
- 3 quarts water
- 2 large onions, chopped
- 4  carrots, chopped
- 3 stalks celery, chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, chopped
- 1 tablespoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ teaspoon ground dried sage
- ½ teaspoon dried thyme
- ½ teaspoon dried rosemary
- ½ teaspoon celery salt

## Instructions

1. Combine the turkey drumsticks and water in a large soup pot and bring to a boil.
