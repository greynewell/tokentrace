## Ingredients

- ½ cup packed all-purpose flour
- ¼ teaspoon fine salt
- ¼ teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- 3 large eggs, at room temperature
- ⅔ cup milk, at room temperature
- 3 tablespoons clarified butter, melted
- ⅓ cup fresh blueberries, or more to taste
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted
- ½  Meyer lemon, juiced
- 2 tablespoons powdered sugar, or to taste
- 2 tablespoons maple syrup, or to taste  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine flour, salt, vanilla extract, eggs, and milk in a high-speed blender. Blend on high speed until completely smooth and very thin, about 1 minute.
3. Heat a 9- or 10-inch cast iron skillet over high heat. Pour clarified butter into the skillet and use a pastry brush to grease the sides. Heat butter until just starting to smoke.
4. Quickly and carefully pour the batter into the center of the skillet, then sprinkle blueberries over top. Transfer skillet to the center of the preheated oven and bake until browned and nicely puffed, 20 to 25 minutes.
5. Carefully remove from the oven and immediately brush the top with melted butter. Squeeze lemon juice over top as Dutch baby deflates. Dust with powdered sugar.
6. Cut in wedges to serve and drizzle with maple syrup.
