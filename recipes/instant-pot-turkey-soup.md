## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 2 medium carrots, peeled and sliced
- 2 stalks celery, sliced
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 1 medium parsnip, peeled and sliced
- 6 cups no-salt-added turkey broth
- 2 ½ cups chopped cooked turkey

- ½ teaspoon freshly ground pepper, or to taste
- 1 pinch red pepper flakes  (Optional)
- 5 ounces tubetti pasta

## Instructions

1. Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®), add oil, and select High Saute function. Add carrots, celery, onion, and parsnip and saute until slightly soft, about 5 minutes. Stir in turkey broth. Add turkey, tomato paste, celery leaves, herbes de Provence, salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes; stir to combine.
2. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 5 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
3. Release pressure in short bursts using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid.
4. Meanwhile, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in pasta and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 7 to 9 minutes. Ladle pasta into bowls and top with soup.
