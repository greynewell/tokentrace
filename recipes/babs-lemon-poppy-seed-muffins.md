## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons poppy seeds
- ½ teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ⅔ cup sugar
- ⅓ cup butter, melted
- 1  egg, lightly beaten
- 1  egg yolk, beaten
- ⅔ cup sour cream
- ¾ teaspoon vanilla extract
- ½ teaspoon lemon peel
- ¼ teaspoon lemon extract

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups, or line with paper muffin liners.
2. Stir flour, poppy seeds, baking powder, and baking soda together in a bowl.
3. Cream the sugar and butter together in a large bowl. Add the whole egg, then the egg yolk, allowing each to blend into the butter mixture before adding the next.
