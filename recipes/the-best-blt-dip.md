## Ingredients

- 1 pound bacon
- 1  tomato, chopped
- 1 (32 ounce) jar mayonnaise
- 32 ounces sour cream
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- salt and pepper to taste
- 1 (1 pound) loaf sliced white sandwich bread

## Instructions

1. In a large skillet, brown entire pound of bacon until crisp, placing cooked strips on paper towels to absorb grease.
2. For best results, finely chop bacon in a food processor or with a hand blender, but finely chopping by hand will also work.
3. In a large mixing bowl, blend bacon, tomato and jar of mayonnaise. Add half the container of sour cream, blend well. Add more sour cream by spoonfuls, until the mixture isn't overwhelmed by the taste of mayonnaise (you'll be left with about a cup or so of sour cream, typically). LIGHTLY coat the top of the mix with garlic powder, and blend. Add a dash of salt and pepper to taste. Toast the bread, then cut into fours.
