## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 ¼ teaspoons baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon ground mace
- ⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ⅛ teaspoon ground cloves
- 1 cup butter, softened
- 1 ½ cups packed brown sugar
- 1 cup white sugar
- 2  eggs
- 1 tablespoon milk
- 1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 cup cornflakes cereal, crumbled
- 3 cups rolled oats
- ½ cup flaked coconut
- 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
- 1 cup chopped walnuts

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. Sift together flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, mace, nutmeg, and cloves; set aside.
2. In a large bowl, cream together butter, brown sugar, and white sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in milk and vanilla. Gradually mix in the sifted ingredients until well blended. Using a wooden spoon, stir in the cornflakes, oats, coconut, chocolate chips, and walnuts. Roll the dough into walnut sized balls, and place 2 inches apart on prepared cookie sheets; flatten slightly.
3. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. I found that slightly under baking these yields wonderfully chewy cookies!
