## Ingredients

- 4  eggs
- ½ cup butter
- 1 cup packed light brown sugar
- 1 (20 ounce) can sliced pineapple
- 10  maraschino cherries, halved
- 1 cup sifted cake flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 tablespoon butter, melted
- 1 teaspoon almond extract

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
2. Melt 1/2 cup butter over very low heat in a 10-inch heavy skillet with a heat-resistant handle or a cast iron pan. Remove from heat; sprinkle brown sugar evenly into the skillet. Arrange pineapple slices to cover the bottom of the skillet. Distribute cherries around pineapples; set aside.
3. Sift together flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl; set aside.
4. Separate eggs; place whites in a large mixing bowl and yolks in a smaller bowl.
5. Beat egg whites on medium speed until soft peaks form. Add white sugar gradually, beating well after each addition. Beat until medium-stiff peaks form.
6. Beat egg yolks at high speed until very thick and yellow. Using a wire whisk or rubber scraper, gently fold egg yolks and flour mixture into whites with an over-and-under motion until blended.
7. Fold 1 tablespoon melted butter and almond extract into batter, then spread batter evenly over pineapple in the skillet.
8. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Loosen cake edges with a table knife. Cool cake for 5 minutes before inverting it onto a serving plate.
