## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 cups raw winter squash (butternut, hubbard, acorn)
- Salt and pepper
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- ½ cup diced onion (1/4-inch)
- ¼ cup diced celery (1/4-inch)
- ¼ cup diced carrot (1/4-inch)
- 1  cinnamon stick
- Sea salt and freshly ground pepper
- 1 (32 ounce) carton Progresso® chicken broth
- ½ teaspoon ground toasted coriander  (Optional)
- Roasted Winter Squash (above)
- ½ cup half-and-half, if desired*  (Optional)
- 2 tablespoons toasted pumpkin seeds
- ½ cup Progresso® plain Panko crispy bread crumbs, toasted light brown in saute pan over medium heat

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Meanwhile, heat butter over medium-high heat in an oven-proof skillet; add diced squash, salt, and pepper. When squash begins to brown, transfer the skillet to the preheated oven. Roast for 15 minutes or until medium-brown on all sides. Remove from oven and let cool slightly. Puree in a food processor, or mash with a potato masher or ricer. Measure 1 1/2 cups squash; reserve.
3. To make soup: Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion, celery, carrot, and cinnamon stick; sauté until soft but not brown, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add broth and coriander; bring to a boil and simmer for several minutes. Stir in reserved squash until smooth; simmer gently to let flavors meld, about 10 minutes. Discard cinnamon stick.
4. Puree soup using an immersion blender or in a blender until smooth. (The soup can be made ahead to this point, cooled, covered, and refrigerated for several days or frozen for about 1 month. It will thicken as it cools and may need thinning with broth or water when reheating.)
5. Return soup to the pan and reheat gently. Add half-and-half: adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Top each serving with pumpkin seeds and toasted bread crumbs.
