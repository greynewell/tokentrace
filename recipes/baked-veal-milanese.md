## Ingredients

- 1  egg
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon milk
- ½ cup all-purpose flour
- ½ cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs
- ½ cup grated pecorino Romano cheese
- ½ teaspoon adobo seasoning, or to taste
- 1 teaspoon olive oil
- 4 (4 ounce) thinly-sliced veal cutlets
- 1 ½ cups arugula, divided
- 4 tablespoons golden raisins, divided
- 4 teaspoons balsamic vinegar, divided
- 4 teaspoons olive oil, divided

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Whisk egg, lemon juice, and milk in a small bowl. Place flour in a separate shallow bowl; mix Italian crumbs, pecorino Romano cheese, and adobo seasoning in a third bowl.
3. Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Dredge each veal piece in flour, dip in egg mixture, and press into bread crumb mixture to coat both sides. Pan-fry the breaded veal cutlets in the hot oil until crumbs are lightly browned and coating is set, about 1 minute per side. Transfer veal to a baking dish.
4. Bake cutlets in the preheated oven until juices run clear, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer veal onto 4 serving plates and top each cutlet with 1/4 of the arugula; sprinkle raisins over the arugula. Drizzle a teaspoon of balsamic vinegar and 1 teaspoon olive oil over each serving.
