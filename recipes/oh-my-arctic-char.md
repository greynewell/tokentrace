## Ingredients

- 1 (10 ounce) fillet arctic char, rinsed and patted dry
- 1 pinch sea salt to taste
- 1  lime, zested and juiced
- ¼ cup olive oil
- ¼ cup sherry wine
- 3 sprigs rosemary, leaves stripped
- 2 cloves garlic
- ground black pepper to taste
- 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking dish with aluminum foil.
2. Season arctic char with sea salt, place in the prepared baking dish, and sprinkle with lime zest.
3. Combine lime juice, olive oil, sherry, rosemary, and garlic in a food processor; pulse until garlic is finely chopped. Spread mixture over fish; season with cayenne pepper and black pepper.
