## Ingredients

- 1 (18.25 ounce) package white cake mix
- 1 teaspoon almond extract
- 2 cups sour cream
- 1 ¾ cups white sugar
- 1 (16 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed
- 2 cups flaked coconut

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two (9-inch) pans.
2. Make cake: Beat cake mix, water, egg whites, oil, and almond extract in a large bowl with an electric mixer on low speed until moistened, about 30 seconds. Increase speed to medium and beat for 2 minutes. Pour batter into the prepared pans.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean, 23 to 28 minutes. Allow cakes to cool completely. Remove cooled cakes from the pans, then cut each in half horizontally.
4. Make frosting: Mix together sour cream and sugar in a medium-sized bowl until combined. Stir in 1 1/2 cups coconut. Reserve 1 cup frosting; spread the rest between the cake layers.
5. Fold whipped topping into reserved frosting; spread around the outside of cake. Sprinkle remaining 1/2 cup coconut over the top of frosted cake.
6. Refrigerate cake for 1 to 3 days before serving.
