## Ingredients

- 1 large green onion
- 4  eggs, beaten
- ¾ cup bean sprouts
- 3 tablespoons soy sauce, divided
- 2 tablespoons peanut oil, divided
- 2 cups sliced fresh mushrooms
- 4 teaspoons cornstarch
- 1 cup chicken or beef broth

## Instructions

1. Thinly slice green onion, and reserve 1 tablespoon of the top for garnish. Stir the remaining onion into the egg along with the bean sprouts and 1 tablespoon of soy sauce.
2. Heat 1 tablespoon of peanut oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until hot. For each pancake, drop 1/4 cup of egg mixture into the hot oil. Cook until the bottoms are set, 1 to 2 minutes, then turn over and continue cooking for another 1 to 2 minutes until cooked through. Transfer to a warm serving plate while you make the remaining pancakes.
3. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of peanut oil in the skillet and cook the mushrooms with the remaining 2 tablespoons of soy sauce until the mushrooms are soft, about 3 minutes. Dissolve the cornstarch in the broth, stir into the mushrooms, and cook until thickened. To serve, pour the sauce over the egg foo yung pancakes, and sprinkle with the reserved onion.
