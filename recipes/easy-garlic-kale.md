## Ingredients

- 1 bunch kale
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic

2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir garlic until sizzling, about 1 minute. Add kale to the skillet and place a cover over the top.
3. Cook, stirring occasionally with tongs, until kale is bright green and slightly tender, 5 to 7 minutes.
