## Ingredients

- 2 pounds beets, peeled and cut into chunks
- 4 cloves cloves garlic, peeled
- 6  peppercorns
- 2  bay leaves
- 3 cups water, boiled and cooled
- 1 tablespoon salt

## Instructions

1. Distribute beet chunks between two jars with lids. Add 2 cloves garlic, 3 peppercorns, and 1 bay leaf to each jar.
2. Combine water and salt in a bowl to make the brine; stir until salt is completely dissolved. Pour enough brine into the jars to completely cover the beets.
