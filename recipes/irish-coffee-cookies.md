## Ingredients

- 1 cup whiskey
- ⅓ cup firmly packed dark brown sugar
- 4 tablespoons instant espresso powder
- 2 tablespoons whiskey
- 2 ¾ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ¾ cup unsalted butter, softened
- ¾ cup firmly packed dark brown sugar
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 2 large eggs, at room temperature
- 1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract
- 4 (1 ounce) squares white chocolate, chopped

## Instructions

1. Place 1 cup whiskey and 1/3 cup brown sugar in a small saucepan over medium heat; bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until mixture has reduced to 1/3 cup, about 20 minutes. Remove whiskey reduction from the heat and cool to room temperature, about 20 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, mix espresso powder and 2 tablespoons whiskey together in a small bowl until espresso powder is dissolved. Whisk flour, baking soda, salt, and nutmeg together in a medium bowl. Set both aside.
3. Cream butter, 3/4 cup brown sugar, and white sugar in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Mix in eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix in vanilla extract. Stir in whiskey reduction, then whiskey-espresso mixture. Add dry ingredients in 3 batches, mixing until just incorporated after each addition. Fold in white chocolate. Cover the dough and place in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.
4. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
5. Scoop out 1 1/2 tablespoonfuls of dough and place 1 inch apart on the prepared baking sheets.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are just set, about 10 minutes. Allow cookies to cool on the sheets for 7 to 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
