## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- ½ pound skinless, boneless chicken breast
- 1 (1 ounce) package dry ranch salad dressing mix (such as Hidden Valley Ranch®)
- 1 large egg
- 1 tablespoon milk
- ¾ cup plain bread crumbs

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place butter in 9x13-inch baking dish and let melt in the preheating oven.
2. Slice chicken breast against the grain into thin strips.
3. Place ranch dressing mix in a small bowl. Whisk egg and milk together in a second bowl. Place bread crumbs in a third bowl.

5. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Gently turn chicken pieces over and bake until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 15 minutes longer.
