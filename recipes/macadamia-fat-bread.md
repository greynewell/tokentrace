## Ingredients

- 1 cup coconut butter
- 1 cup chopped macadamia nuts
- 5  eggs, room temperature
- 1 tablespoon stevia sugar substitute (such as Truvia®)
- 2 teaspoons baking soda
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- 2 ½ tablespoons lemon juice

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a loaf pan with parchment paper.
2. Place coconut butter and macadamia nuts in a food processor and process on high to achieve a part butter, part chunky, nut meal. Reduce speed to medium-low and add one egg. Run processor to combine, about 10 seconds. Add remaining eggs, one at a time, blending until mixture is creamy.
3. Turn off the food processor and add stevia, baking soda, and salt; process to combine, 10 to 15 seconds. Clean edges of the bowl and process until mixture is evenly blended. Pour in lemon juice and reduce speed to low; blend well. Clean the sides of the bowl again and mix once more to thoroughly combine.
4. Pour mixture into the prepared loaf pan.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Let cool before transferring to a wire rack.
