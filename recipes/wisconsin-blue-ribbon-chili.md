## Ingredients

- 1 ½ pounds lean ground beef
- 1 stalk celery, chopped
- ½  red bell pepper, chopped
- 1  white onion, chopped
- 1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes
- 1 ½ cups tomato juice
- 2 cups water
- 2 tablespoons chili powder
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 6 cubes beef bouillon

Continue to cook until the beef is browned, about 8 more minutes. Drain excess fat.
