- 7 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 4 cups confectioners' sugar
- ¼ cup vegetable oil

## Instructions

1. In a large bowl, cream together the sugar and butter until smooth. Beat in the eggs and egg yolks, one at a time, mixing well after each. Mix in vanilla extract. Combine flour, baking powder, and salt; stir into the sugar mixture. Cover dough and chill for at least 1 hour.
