## Ingredients

- 1 cup white sugar
- ½ cup unsalted butter, softened
- 2  large eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 3  ripe bananas, mashed
- 1 tablespoon milk
- 1 teaspoon allspice
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 pinch salt

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line 12 muffin cups with papers liners.
2. Beat sugar and butter with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth and creamy. Beat first egg into butter mixture until completely blended; beat in vanilla extract with remaining egg.
