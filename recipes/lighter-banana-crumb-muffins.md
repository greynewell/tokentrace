## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 3  very ripe bananas, mashed

- 1  egg, beaten
- ⅓ cup unsweetened applesauce

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper liners.
