## Ingredients

- 1 (16 ounce) package angel hair pasta
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 6  green onions, thinly sliced
- 3 tablespoons chopped fresh garlic
- 1 ½ pounds frozen cooked shrimp, tails removed
- 1 cup white wine
- 1 ½ tablespoons cornstarch
- ½ cup heavy whipping cream
- 2 teaspoons lime juice
- 2 teaspoons Creole seasoning
- 2 teaspoons white sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 (9 ounce) package fresh baby spinach with carrots
- ¼ cup chopped fresh basil

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook angel hair pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain.
2. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir green onions and garlic in the butter until softened, about 2 minutes. Add frozen shrimp; cook and stir until thawed, about 5 minutes. Transfer shrimp to a bowl.
3. Whisk wine and cornstarch together in a small bowl until smooth. Pour over the green onions and garlic in the skillet. Stir in heavy cream, lime juice, Creole seasoning, sugar, salt, and pepper; simmer until mixture thickens, about 3 minutes.
4. Return shrimp to the skillet. Stir in spinach and basil. Cook and stir until shrimp is heated through and spinach is wilted, about 5 minutes. Serve over angel hair pasta.
