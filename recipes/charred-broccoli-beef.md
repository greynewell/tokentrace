## Ingredients

- 1 pound skirt steak, cut in half across the grain
- kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- ¼ cup oyster sauce

## Instructions

1. Season steak generously with kosher salt and black pepper on both sides.
2. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon cornstarch lightly over both sides.
3. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a skillet over high heat.
4. Sear steak halves until surface is browned and crusty, 3 to 4 minutes per side.

12. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil; spread broccoli florets on top, stem-side down.
13. Roast broccoli florets in the preheated oven until charred, 10 to 12 minutes.
14. Cut steak halves into 2 or 3 pieces with the grain.
15. Slice each piece against the grain into 1/8-inch slices.
16. Pour 2 teaspoons vegetable oil into the skillet used to brown the steak; heat over medium-high heat.
17. Add 3 cloves minced garlic; let sizzle for just 30 seconds.
