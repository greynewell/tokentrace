## Ingredients

- 2 large onions
- 1 (1 1/2-pound) flank steak, cut into 4 pieces
- 1  green bell pepper, quartered
- 1  bay leaf
- 2 cloves garlic, smashed
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ cup fresh lime juice
- 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
- 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 teaspoons butter
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 1  lime, cut into wedges  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Cut 1 onion in half and thinly slice the remaining onion. Set aside.
2. Combine flank steak, halved onion, bell pepper, and bay leaf in a large saucepan. Cover with water and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium and let simmer until meat is easily shredded with 2 forks, about 20 minutes. Transfer flank steak to a work surface and let cool, about 10 minutes. Strain beef broth and save for another use. Shred cooled meat using 2 forks and place into a separate bowl.
3. Mix garlic with 1/2 teaspoon salt in another bowl. Apply paste onto the meat, along with lime juice, olive oil, and sliced onion. Let stand at room temperature for at least 30 minutes to 1 1/2 hours.
4. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and add butter. Working in small batches, spread shredded beef in a thin layer into the skillet and season with salt and pepper. Cook, turning once or twice, until sizzling and crispy, about 7 minutes per batch. Transfer to a platter and serve with lime wedges.
