## Ingredients

- 1 pound dogfish fillets
- 1 pound whiting fish fillets
- 6 tablespoons olive oil, or more to taste
- 1  onion, finely chopped
- 1  celery, chopped
- 1  carrot, chopped
- 4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
- ¾ cup white wine
- 3 each tomatoes, peeled and chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- 6 cups boiling water
- 1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 12 (1/4 inch thick) slices French baguette, toasted

## Instructions

1. Cut dogfish and whiting fillets into large pieces. Rinse well in cool water and pat dry.
2. Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion, lower heat a bit, and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in celery and carrot and cook for 5 minutes. Add parsley.
3. Pour in wine, raise heat, and cook until it reduces by about half, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in tomatoes and garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes. Add boiling water. Return to a boil, then cook for 15 minutes.
4. Stir in dogfish and whiting and simmer until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Use a slotted spoon to remove the fish; discard any bones.
5. Fill a food processor halfway with liquid and vegetable mixture. Cover and hold lid down with a potholder; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend until smooth. Pour into a pot. Repeat with remaining soup. Add fish to the soup and reheat to simmering.
6. Place 2 toasted baguette slices in each bowl, drizzle with olive oil, and ladle soup over top.
