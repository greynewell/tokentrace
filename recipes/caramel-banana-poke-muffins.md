## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups boiling water
- ¾ cup old-fashioned oats
- ½ cup butter at room temperature
- 1 cup packed brown sugar
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 cup mashed overripe bananas
- 2  eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 (14 ounce) can caramel-flavored sweetened condensed milk
- 1 cup packed brown sugar
- 1 cup chopped walnuts  (Optional)
- 1 cup sweetened flaked coconut  (Optional)
- ½ cup butter, melted
- ¼ cup heavy whipping cream

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners.
2. Combine boiling water and oats in a small bowl; let stand for 20 minutes.
3. Combine 1/2 cup butter, 1 cup brown sugar, and white sugar in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until creamy, about 3 minutes. Add bananas, eggs, and vanilla extract; stir well to combine. Mix in oatmeal.
4. Sift flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl. Fold into the oatmeal mixture. Divide batter evenly among the muffin cups.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Let cool in the tin, about 5 minutes.
6. Poke 3 deep holes into each muffin using the round handle of a small wooden spoon. Drizzle 1 tablespoon caramel-flavored condensed milk over each muffin. Let cool completely, about 15 minutes.
7. Mix 1 cup brown sugar, walnuts, coconut, 1/2 cup melted butter, and heavy cream together in a bowl to make topping. Sprinkle topping over muffins.
