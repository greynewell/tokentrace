## Ingredients

- 1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
- 1/2 can sugar (use sweetened condensed milk can as measure)
- 3 cups grated fresh coconut

## Instructions

1. Combine condensed milk, sugar, coconut, and vanilla extract in a large saucepan. Heat over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens and becomes a little darker. If you find that the cocada is cooking too quickly, reduce heat to low and continue stirring.
