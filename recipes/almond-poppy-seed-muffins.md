## Ingredients

- ¾ cup white sugar
- ½ cup butter, softened
- 2  egg yolks
- 1 ½ teaspoons almond extract
- 1 teaspoon freshly grated lemon zest
- 1 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 ⅛ teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ cup buttermilk
- 2 ½ tablespoons poppy seeds
- 2  egg whites

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners.
2. Stir flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl.
3. Beat sugar and butter with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy; the mixture should be noticeably lighter in color. Add 1 egg yolk and beat until fully blended into the butter mixture; repeat with the remaining egg yolk. Beat in almond extract and lemon zest.
4. Add flour mixture to the butter mixture in 2 batches, alternating with buttermilk, beating batter briefly after each addition. Fold in poppy seeds.
5. Beat egg whites in a glass or metal bowl until stiff peaks form. Fold egg whites into the batter. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 2/3 full.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until muffins are golden and the tops spring back when lightly pressed, 15 to 18 minutes.
7. Remove muffins from the oven, turn out onto a wire rack, and cool.
