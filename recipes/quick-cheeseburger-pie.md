## Ingredients

- 1 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ cup shortening
- 4 tablespoons cold water
- 1 pound lean ground beef
- 1 small onion, chopped
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- ⅓ cup dill pickle juice
- ⅓ cup milk
- ½ cup chopped dill pickles
- 2 cups shredded Swiss cheese, divided

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. In a medium bowl, mix 1 1/3 cups flour and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cut in shortening until mixture resembles tiny peas. Add cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, stirring with a fork after each addition. Mix lightly just until pastry almost cleans the sides of the bowl. Pat into the bottom and sides of an 8-inch pie pan. Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes.
3. Crumble ground beef into a large skillet and sauté over medium heat for 1 minute. Add onion and garlic. Continue to sauté until onion is browned, about 10 minutes; drain grease.
4. Sprinkle beef mixture with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 cup flour. Stir in pickle liquid, milk, pickles, and 1 cup shredded cheese. Spoon mixture into pastry shell.
5. Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes. Sprinkle top with remaining 1 cup cheese and bake an additional 5 minutes, until pastry is golden brown and cheese is bubbly.
