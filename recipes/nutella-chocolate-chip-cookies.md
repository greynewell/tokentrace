## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 cup whole wheat flour
- 2 teaspoons baking soda
- 1 ½ cups brown sugar
- ⅔ cup chocolate-hazelnut spread (such as Nutella®)
- ½ cup butter, softened
- ½ cup white sugar
- 2  eggs
- 1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract
- 2 cups milk chocolate chips
- ½ cup rainbow chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 cookie sheets or line with parchment paper.
2. Whisk both flours and baking soda together in a medium bowl.
3. Cream the brown sugar, chocolate-hazelnut spread, butter, and white sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer. Beat in eggs and vanilla.
4. Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture; stir until a stiff dough forms. Mix in chocolate chips and rainbow chocolate chips.
5. Roll dough into 2-inch balls. Place 1 to 2 inches apart onto the prepared baking sheets.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until cookies have risen, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 5 to 10 minutes; cookies will firm up as they cool. Remove to a wire rack to cool completely.
