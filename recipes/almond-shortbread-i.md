## Ingredients

- 1 cup butter, room temperature
- ½ cup white sugar
- 2 teaspoons almond extract
- 2 ½ cups sifted all-purpose flour
- ⅓ cup granulated sugar for decoration

## Instructions

1. In a large bowl, beat butter with 1/2 cup sugar and almond extract until light and fluffy. With a wooden spoon, stir in flour until smooth and well combined. Divide dough into 2 parts. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 2 hours.
2. Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
