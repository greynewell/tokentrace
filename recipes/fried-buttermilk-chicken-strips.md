## Ingredients

- 1 ½ pounds chicken tenders
- 2 cups buttermilk
- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 1 tablespoon garlic salt
- 2 teaspoons mustard powder
- 1 teaspoon ground paprika
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 2 cups peanut oil, or as needed
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Soak chicken tenders in buttermilk for 20 to 30 minutes in the refrigerator.
2. While chicken is soaking, combine flour, salt, garlic salt, mustard powder, paprika, and pepper in a large brown bag.
3. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
4. Drain chicken and shake lightly to remove excess buttermilk. Chicken should still be damp. Drop chicken into the bag of seasoned flour and shake until well coated.
5. Drop chicken into hot oil, about 6 pieces at a time, depending on the size of your pot. Cook until golden brown, crispy, and no longer pink in the centers, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from oil and drain on paper towels. Sprinkle with salt and pepper while still warm.
