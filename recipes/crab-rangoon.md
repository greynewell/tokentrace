## Ingredients

- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
- 1 (6 ounce) can crabmeat, drained and flaked
- 2  green onions with tops, thinly sliced
- 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
- ½ teaspoon light soy sauce
- 48  wonton wrappers

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly spray a baking sheet with cooking spray.
2. Combine cream cheese, crabmeat, green onions, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, and soy sauce together in a bowl.
3. To prevent wonton wrappers from drying, prepare only one or two Rangoon at a time, keeping the other wrappers under a damp towel. Place 1 teaspoon crab filling onto the center of each wonton wrapper. Moisten edges with water and fold wrapper diagonally to form a triangle, pressing edges to seal and pressing out any air pockets. Moisten one of the bottom corners. Create a crown by pulling both bottom corners together and sealing. Repeat with remaining wonton wrappers and crab filling.
4. Arrange Rangoon on the baking sheet and lightly spray with cooking spray.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes.
