## Ingredients

- 4 cups seafood stock
- 4 whole lobster tails
- 5 sticks salted butter
- ½ medium white onion, diced
- 2 medium (blank)s carrots, diced
- 2 stalks celery, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- ½ cup cream sherry
- ¾ cup uncooked white rice
- 1  bay leaf
- 4 tablespoons tomato paste
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh tarragon
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- ¾ cup heavy cream
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Pour 4 cups seafood stock into a large pot and bring to a rolling boil. Add lobster tails and boil until flesh is opaque, about 5 minutes. Remove tails and reserve all broth. Shell all tail meat and set aside.
2. Melt butter in another pot over medium heat. Add onion, carrots, and celery. Saute until fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes. Add garlic and saute, 30 to 40 seconds. Pour in sherry; let it reduce by half. Pour in reserved seafood stock. Add rice and bay leaf. Bring to a boil, then reduce to medium-low. Let simmer until rice is tender, about 30 minutes. Remove bay leaf.
3. Blend all contents of the soup until smooth using an immersion blender. Add tomato paste, tarragon, salt, thyme, pepper, paprika, and cayenne. Let simmer over medium-low heat for 30 minutes more. Pour in cream and stir in well for that trademark pinkish/orange bisque color. Season with salt and pepper. Ladle soup into bowls and top with a generous lump of lobster meat.
