## Ingredients

- 1  large heat-resistant nylon oven bag (such as Reynolds® Oven Bags)
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour

- 2 stalks celery, cut into 1-inch pieces

- 4  turkey thighs
- 1 tablespoon olive oil

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Sprinkle flour into oven bag and place it in a 9x11-inch pan.
