## Ingredients

- 1 pound lean ground beef
- 1 cup tomato sauce
- ⅓ cup sofrito
- 8  green olives, finely chopped
- 1 teaspoon crushed garlic
- 1 teaspoon salt, divided
- ¼ cup recao
- ¼ teaspoon dried oregano
- cooking spray
- ¾ cup vegetable oil
- 6 large ripe plantains - peeled, halved, and each half cut lengthwise into 4 slices
- 5  large eggs
- 1 (9 ounce) package frozen French cut green beans, thawed and drained
- 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese

## Instructions

1. Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add ground beef; cook and stir until browned on the outside and no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes. Remove meat from pan; drain fat.
2. Place tomato sauce, sofrito, green olives, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt, recao, and oregano in the skillet. Cook and stir over medium-low heat for 5 minutes. Return ground beef to skillet; reduce to a simmer. Cook, uncovered and stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes more.
3. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray an 8x8-inch baking pan with cooking spray.
4. Pour oil into a large skillet over medium-high heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fry plantain slices until golden, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels.
5. Beat eggs thoroughly in a bowl; add 1/2 teaspoon salt.
6. Line the bottom of the baking pan with half the plantains, overlapping as needed. Layer ground beef mixture, green beans, and remaining plantains; pour eggs on top. Top with mozzarella cheese.
7. Bake in the preheated oven until eggs are set and cheese is melted, 20 to 25 minutes.
