## Ingredients

- 4 (6 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- ⅓ cup dry white wine  (Optional)
- 1  lemon, juiced
- 1 small shallot, chopped
- 2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 clove garlic, crushed
- 1  lemon, juiced
- 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 teaspoons lemon zest
- ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, divided
- ½ teaspoon salt, divided
- 4 cups trimmed arugula
- 8 ounces cherry tomatoes, halved

## Instructions

1. Pound chicken breasts on a work surface using a meat tenderizer or heavy pan to 1/4-inch thick. Whisk wine, juice of 1 lemon, shallot, 2 teaspoons olive oil, and garlic together in a shallow bowl. Add chicken breasts; marinate for 15 minutes.
2. Whisk juice of 1 lemon, vinegar, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and lemon zest together in a large bowl; stir in 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Add arugula and tomatoes; toss to combine.
3. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate, or heat a skillet over high heat.
4. Remove chicken from marinade; season with remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.
5. Cook chicken on preheated grill until golden brown and just cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Plate chicken with arugula salad on top.
