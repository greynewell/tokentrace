## Ingredients

- 5 tablespoons butter, melted, divided
- ½ cup white sugar
- 1 ¼ teaspoons ground cinnamon
- ¼ teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg
- 1 medium apple - peeled, cored, and minced
- 2 (17.5 ounce) cans refrigerated cinnamon roll dough with icing
- ½ cup walnuts, chopped and toasted

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Brush the inside of a fluted tube pan with 1 tablespoon melted butter.
2. Mix sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a bowl. Combine 1/4 cup of the spiced sugar mixture with minced apples and stir until coated.
3. Separate cinnamon roll dough rounds and cut into quarters. Set aside the icing.
4. Spoon 1/2 of the apple mixture and 1/2 of the walnuts into the bottom of the prepared pan. Roll 1/2 of the cinnamon roll quarters in the remaining spiced sugar and place on top of the apples and walnuts. Spoon 1/2 of the remaining butter over dough. Repeat with remaining apples, walnuts, dough, and butter.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 45 minutes. Let bread cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then invert onto a plate. Cool for 5 more minutes before coating with icing.
