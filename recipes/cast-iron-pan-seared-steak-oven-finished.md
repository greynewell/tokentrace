## Ingredients

- 2 (6 ounce) beef top sirloin steaks
- 2 cups orange juice
- 1 cup apple cider vinegar
- ½ cup Worcestershire sauce
- 2 teaspoons olive oil
- 1 ½ tablespoons steak seasoning (such as Fiesta Brand® Uncle Chris'), or to taste
- freshly ground black pepper to taste
- sea salt to taste

## Instructions

1. Place steaks side by side in large casserole dish. Add orange juice, cider vinegar, and Worcestershire sauce. Marinate, uncovered, in the refrigerator for 45 minutes.
2. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
3. Remove casserole dish from refrigerator. Cover steaks with plastic wrap and let allow to come to room temperature, at least 15 minutes.
4. Place steaks on a clean work surface and generously rub with steak seasoning and black pepper.
5. Heat olive oil in a cast-iron skillet over high heat.
6. Cook steaks in the hot skillet until lightly browned on the bottom, 2 1/2 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side and red in the center, about 2 minutes more. Transfer skillet with the steaks to the oven.
7. Bake in the preheated oven until steaks are firm and reddish-pink to lightly pink in the center, 8 to 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read from 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) to 140 degrees F (60 degrees C).
8. Remove steaks from oven; season with salt. Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.
