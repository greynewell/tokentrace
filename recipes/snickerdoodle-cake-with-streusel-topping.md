## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 2 ½ cups white sugar
- ½ cup butter
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2  eggs
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
- 3 teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¾ cup milk
- 1 cup brown sugar

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan.
2. Mix 2 tablespoons white sugar and 2 teaspoons cinnamon together and sprinkle 1/2 of the mixture into the bottom of the greased baking pan. Save remaining 1/2 and set aside for sprinkling over cake batter.
3. Cream together sugar, butter, and vanilla extract with an electric mixer in a large bowl. Add eggs; mix to combine.
