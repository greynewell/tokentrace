## Ingredients

- ⅓ cup maple syrup
- ¼ teaspoon ground dried chipotle pepper
- 1 pinch sea salt
- 1 ½ cups butter- and garlic-flavored croutons
- 1 large egg
- 1 (1 pound) skinless, center-cut salmon fillet, cut into 1 1/2-inch chunks
- cooking spray

## Instructions

1. Combine maple syrup, chipotle powder, and salt in saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Reduce heat to low to keep warm.
2. Place croutons in the bowl of a mini food processor; pulse until crushed into fine crumbs. Transfer to a shallow bowl. Whisk egg in a separate bowl.
3. Preheat the air fryer to 390 degrees F (200 degrees C).
4. Sprinkle salmon lightly with sea salt. Lightly dip salmon into egg mixture, letting excess drip off. Coat salmon in crouton breading and shake off extra. Set on a plate and mist lightly with cooking spray.
5. Spray basket of the air fryer with cooking spray. Place salmon nuggets inside, working in batches to avoid overcrowding, if necessary.
6. Cook in the preheated air fryer for 3 minutes. Gently turn salmon pieces, spray lightly with oil, and cook until salmon is cooked throughout, 3 to 4 more minutes. Place on a serving platter and drizzle with warm chipotle-maple syrup. Serve immediately.
