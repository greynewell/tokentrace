## Ingredients

- 5  potatoes
- 1 pound ground beef
- ½ cup chopped onion
- 1 (16 ounce) can green beans, drained
- 1 (10.75 ounce) can  condensed tomato soup
- ½ cup warm milk
- 1  egg, beaten
- 2 cloves garlic, chopped

## Instructions

4. Mash the cooled potatoes with milk, egg, garlic, pepper, and salt; spoon in mounds over the ground beef mixture. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese over the potatoes.
