## Ingredients

- 4 (4 ounce) fillets frozen salmon fillets
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- ⅓ cup bourbon
- 3 tablespoons pure maple syrup
- 1 teaspoon Sriracha sauce, or more to taste
- 1 pinch salt

## Instructions

1. Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 5 minutes.
2. Sprinkle salmon fillets with salt and pepper and place into the air fryer basket.
3. Air-fry for 6 minutes, or 8 minutes if the fillets are thick.
4. Meanwhile, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in bourbon, maple syrup, Sriracha, and salt. Continue stirring while glaze comes to boil. As soon as it boils, immediately lower heat to medium-low, and cook until glaze has thickened, about 10 minutes.
5. Brush glaze onto salmon fillets using a silicon brush. Lower air fryer temperature to 370 degrees F (187 degrees C) and air-fry for an additional 6 minutes, or 8 minutes if the fillets are thick.
