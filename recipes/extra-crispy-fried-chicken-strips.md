## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 2 large eggs
- 4 tablespoons water
- 1 ½ pounds boneless, skinless chicken breast tenders
- 2 cups vegetable oil for frying, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Combine flour, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl. Mix eggs and water together in a small bowl.
2. Place some chicken strips in the flour mixture to coat, then gently shake to remove any excess flour. Coat strips in egg. Return to the flour mixture and coat again; repeat with egg mixture. Coat once more in the flour mixture, placing strips on a plate while you continue with remaining chicken.
3. Let strips sit for 5 minutes to allow flour to set.
4. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C); oil is ready if you drop some water in and it sizzles.
5. Working in batches if needed, place strips in the hot oil. Cook for 8 minutes. Turn over and continue to cook until golden brown, no longer pink in the centers, and juices run clear, about 8 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Place strips on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess grease.
