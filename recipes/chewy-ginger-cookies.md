## Ingredients

- 2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
- 4 teaspoons ground ginger
- 2 teaspoons baking soda
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground allspice
- 1 cup white sugar
- ¾ cup butter, softened
- 1  egg
- ¼ cup dark molasses
- ⅓ cup chopped crystallized ginger  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Sift the flour, ground ginger, baking soda, cinnamon, salt, and allspice together into a mixing bowl; stir.
3. Beat sugar and butter with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth and creamy. Beat egg and molasses into creamed butter mixture. Gradually stir flour mixture into butter mixture until just coming together into a batter. Gently fold crystallized ginger through the batter.
4. Roll rounded teaspoon-sized amounts of dough into small balls between your hands and place onto ungreased baking sheets about 2 inches apart.
