## Ingredients

- ¼ cup cracker crumbs
- 1 large egg, beaten
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon hot sauce
- 1 teaspoon prepared yellow mustard
- ½ teaspoon paprika
- 1 (14.75 ounce) can salmon, drained and flaked
- ¼ cup honey mustard

## Instructions

1. Combine cracker crumbs, egg, lemon juice, hot sauce, mustard, and paprika in a bowl; add salmon, stirring well. Allow the mix to stand for at least 5 minutes so that the flavors can join hands.
2. Preheat a grill to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a grill pan with foil.
3. Squeeze excess liquid from the mixture; this will allow the patties to hold together and turn that pretty golden brown. Form into patties.
4. Cook on the preheated grill until golden brown and fish flakes easily with a fork, about 10 minutes on each side. Serve with honey mustard.
