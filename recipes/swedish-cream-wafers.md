## Ingredients

- 1 cup butter, softened
- ⅓ cup heavy whipping cream
- 2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
- ⅓ cup granulated sugar for decoration
- ¼ cup butter, softened
- ¾ cup sifted confectioners' sugar
- 1  egg yolk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 drops red food coloring

## Instructions

1. Make wafers: Mix butter, cream, and sifted flour with an electric mixer until well combined. Chill for at least 1 hour.
2. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Sprinkle white sugar over a sheet of waxed paper.
3. On a floured board, roll out 1/3 of the dough to 1/8 inch thick. Cut about 60 wafers with a 1 1/2-inch round cookie cutter. Press both sides of each wafer into the white sugar, then transfer to ungreased baking sheets. Prick each cookie about 4 times with a fork.
4. Bake in the preheated oven 7 to 9 minutes. Let cookies cool.
5. Make filling while wafers are cooling: Blend butter, confectioners' sugar, egg yolk, and vanilla together with an electric mixer. Tint with food coloring.
6. Spread filling onto a cooled wafer and top with a second wafer. Press gently to seal. Repeat with remaining wafers and filling.
