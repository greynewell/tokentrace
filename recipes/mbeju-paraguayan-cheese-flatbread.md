## Ingredients

- 2 cups cassava flour
- ½ teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper
- 4 tablespoons cold butter, cut into cubes
- 4 ounces freshly grated mild Cheddar cheese
- ⅓ cup cold milk, or more as needed

## Instructions

1. Combine cassava flour, salt, cayenne, butter, and Cheddar cheese in a bowl by rubbing the mixture between your fingertips until the mixture resembles large, coarse crumbs. Drizzle in about 1/3 cup of milk and continue mixing and rubbing with your hands until the mixture resembles very small pebbles and is moist enough to hold together in large clumps when squeezed tightly together, adding more milk if needed.
2. Place a small (6-inch) dry, nonstick pan over medium-high heat until hot, about 2 minutes. Transfer in a heaping 1/2-cup of the mixture, or enough to cover the bottom of the pan. The mixture should be 1/4 inch to 1/2 inch deep for this to work. Press the top of the mixture down slightly to settle and use a spatula to go around the edges of the mixture, pressing any loose crumbs back into the flatbread.
3. Cover and cook until the bottom is golden browned, a crust forms under the flatbread, and a spatula can be slid underneath, about 3 minutes per side. Turn over with a combination of tossing the pan up slightly, while flipping with the spatula. You can also place a plate over the pan, and invert the flatbread to turn, and then slide back into the pan. Cook the other side until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes more. Remove from heat allow to rest for 2 minutes before serving warm.
