## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- ⅔ cup shortening
- 1 ⅓ cups white sugar
- 1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract
- 3  eggs
- ⅔ cup milk
- ½ cup white sugar
- 6 tablespoons butter
- ⅓ cup water
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ¾ teaspoon ground cinnamon

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and lightly flour a 10 inch Bundt pan. Stir together the flour, baking powder, 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon and salt; set aside.
2. In a large bowl, beat shortening, 1 1/3 cups white sugar and 1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating for at least 1 minute after each egg. Beat in the flour mixture alternately with the milk. Pour batter into prepared pan.
3. Bake in the preheated oven for 40 to 45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack. Remove cake from pan while it is still warm, and poke holes around the top of the cake with a fork. Pour the warm cinnamon syrup into the holes and onto the top and sides of the cake.
4. To Make Cinnamon Syrup: In a saucepan, combine 1/2 cup white sugar, butter, water, 1 teaspoon vanilla and 3/4 teaspoons ground cinnamon. Heat and stir until butter melts.
