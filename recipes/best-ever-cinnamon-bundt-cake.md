## Ingredients

- 1 ¼ cups white sugar
- ½ cup unsalted butter, softened
- 4 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 3 large eggs, at room temperature
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ cup buttermilk, at room temperature

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Brush a fluted tube pan (such as Bundt®) with a little butter and dust with some flour.
2. Cream sugar, butter, and oil together in a bowl until well combined. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix in vanilla extract.
3. Sift 2 cups plus 2 tablespoons flour, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a separate bowl. Fold 1/3 of the flour mixture gently into the butter mixture with a spatula. Mix in 1/2 of the buttermilk. Repeat once more, then mix in remaining flour until just combined. Avoid overmixing. Pour batter into the prepared pan.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Allow cake to cool in the pan for 15 minutes before inverting onto a cooling rack to cool completely.
