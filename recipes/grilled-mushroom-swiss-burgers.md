## Ingredients

- 1 ½ pounds lean ground beef
- ½ teaspoon seasoned meat tenderizer
- salt and pepper to taste
- 2 teaspoons butter
- 2 (4 ounce) cans sliced mushrooms, drained
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 4 slices Swiss cheese
- 6  hamburger buns

## Instructions

1. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
2. Divide ground beef into 6 equal-sized patties; season with meat tenderizer, salt, and pepper. Set aside.
3. Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms and soy sauce; cook and stir until browned. Set aside and keep warm.
4. Grill patties on the preheated grill until cooked through, about 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
