## Ingredients

- 4 pounds pork spareribs
- 1 cup brown sugar
- ¼ cup ketchup
- ¼ cup soy sauce
- ¼ cup Worcestershire sauce
- ¼ cup rum
- ½ cup chile sauce
- 2 cloves garlic, crushed
- 1 teaspoon dry mustard
- 1 dash ground black pepper

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Cut spareribs into serving size portions; wrap in double thickness of foil.
3. Bake in the preheated oven for 1 1/2 hours. Unwrap and drain drippings. (I usually freeze drippings to use later in soups.) Place ribs in a large roasting pan.
4. Mix together brown sugar, chile sauce, ketchup, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, rum, garlic, mustard, and pepper in a bowl. Coat ribs with sauce and marinate at room temperature for 1 hour or refrigerate for 8 hours to overnight.
5. Preheat the grill to medium heat. Position grate 4 inches above heat source; grease the grate with cooking spray.
6. Cook ribs on the preheated grill for 30 minutes, basting with marinade.
