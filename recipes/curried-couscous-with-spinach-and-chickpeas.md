## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 small yellow onion, chopped
- ½ cup chopped sun-dried tomatoes
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill
- 3 cloves garlic, crushed
- 12 ounces chopped frozen spinach
- 1 tablespoon pale dry sherry
- 1 tablespoon curry powder
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
- 1 (15 ounce) can chickpeas, drained
- 2 cups vegetable broth
- 1 cup whole wheat couscous
- salt to taste

## Instructions

1. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion, sun-dried tomato, dill, and garlic; cook and stir until onions start to turn translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in spinach, increase heat to medium high, and cook until spinach begins to wilt, 5 to 10 minutes.
2. Pour in sherry and cook until most liquid has evaporated, about 5 minutes. Add curry powder, cayenne pepper, chickpeas, and 1 cup of the vegetable broth; cook for about 5 minutes. Add remaining broth and bring mixture to a boil. Remove from heat, stir in couscous, and cover until couscous absorbs all the liquid, 5 to 10 minutes. Season with salt.
