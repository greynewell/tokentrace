## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1  egg, beaten
- ⅔ cup cold water
- 1 pound bacon
- 5 pounds baking potatoes
- 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
- salt and pepper to taste
- ¼ pound bacon
- 1 (32 ounce) jar sauerkraut - drained, rinsed and minced
- 3 tablespoons sour cream
- salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Make dough: Combine flour, cold water, beaten egg, and salt in a bowl; mix until a smooth dough forms. Cover the bowl and set aside.
2. Make potato filling: Place potatoes in a large pot. Add water to cover, bring to a boil, and cook until tender, 25 to 35 minutes. Drain and mash in the pot until smooth.
3. Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Crumble and stir into mashed potatoes. Stir in cheese; season with salt and pepper. Set aside.
4. Make sauerkraut filling: Place bacon in the skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain, crumble, and place in a medium bowl. Stir in sauerkraut, then sour cream. Mix well.
5. Roll dough out on a floured surface to 1/8- to 1/4-inch thickness. Cut out 3-inch circles with a cookie cutter or an upside-down drinking glass. Place a spoonful of potato or sauerkraut filling in the center of each circle and fold over, pinching edges together to seal.
6. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; drop perogies in boiling water and cook until they float, 4 to 5 minutes.
