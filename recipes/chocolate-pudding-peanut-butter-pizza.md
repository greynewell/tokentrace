## Ingredients

- 1 (17.5 ounce) package peanut butter cookie mix (such as Betty Crocker®)
- 1 large egg
- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 tablespoon water
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 (8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed
- 1 ¾ cups whole milk
- 1 (3.9 ounce) package instant chocolate pudding mix
- ¼ cup miniature semisweet chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 12-inch pizza pan.
2. Stir cookie mix, egg, oil, and water together in a bowl until a soft dough forms. Place dough on the pan; spread out to look like a pizza crust.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until edges are light golden brown, about 15 minutes. Let cool.
4. Meanwhile, combine cream cheese and sugar in a medium bowl; beat with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Fold in 1/2 of the whipped topping and set aside.
5. Whisk milk and pudding mix together in a medium bowl until thickened.
6. Spread the cream cheese mixture over the cookie crust, leaving a little of the crust showing around the edges. Spread chocolate pudding over the cream cheese mixture, leaving a little of the cream cheese layer showing.
7. Spread the remaining whipped topping over the pudding, leaving a little of the pudding showing. Sprinkle chocolate chips over the whipped topping. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
