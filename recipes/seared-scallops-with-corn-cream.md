## Ingredients

- 2 ears  fresh white corn, kernels cut from cob
- 1 cup chicken broth
- 2 tablespoons butter
- salt to taste
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper
- 12 large sea scallops, rinsed and patted dry
- 1  red Fresno pepper, thinly sliced
- 2 teaspoons canola oil
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- ½ teaspoon smoked paprika, or to taste
- 1 splash water
- 1 tablespoon butter, or more to taste
- ½  lemon, juiced
- ¼ cup radish sprouts, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Stir corn kernels, chicken broth, 2 tablespoons butter, cayenne pepper, and salt together in a saucepan; bring to a simmer, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until corn is tender, about 5 minutes.
2. Pour corn mixture into a blender no more than half full. Cover and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth. Pour pureed corn mixture through a fine-mesh strainer into a saucepan. Season with salt to taste.
3. Toss scallops, Fresno pepper, canola oil, kosher salt, and smoked paprika in a bowl until scallops are completely coated. Separate pepper slices from scallops.
4. Heat a large heavy skillet over high heat until very hot, about 5 minutes. Cook scallops in hot skillet until browned on one side, about 3 minutes. Turn and cook on the other side until cooked through, about 3 minutes more. Cook and stir sliced peppers on the side of the skillet while the scallops are cooking.
5. Remove skillet from heat; transfer scallops to a plate, leaving peppers in hot skillet. Stir water and 1 tablespoon butter into peppers until butter melts. Drizzle lemon juice over peppers; stir to glaze peppers completely.
6. Divide corn cream between four bowls. Place 3 scallops over corn puree and top with glazed peppers. Garnish with radish sprouts.
