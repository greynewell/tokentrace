## Ingredients

- ¼ cup butter
- 1 ½ teaspoons minced garlic
- 1 pound peeled and deveined medium shrimp
- ¼ cup chopped green onions
- ¼ cup dry white wine
- ⅓ cup heavy cream
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil

## Instructions

1. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in the shrimp, garlic, and green onions.
