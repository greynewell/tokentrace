## Ingredients

- 2 (4 ounce) frozen salmon fillets
- 2  (13-inch) parchment paper sheets
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon salted butter, melted
- 2 sprigs fresh oregano
- 1  lemon, sliced

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Place each salmon fillet in the center of a parchment paper sheet. Season with salt and pepper and drizzle with melted butter. Arrange oregano and lemon slices down the length of each fillet.
3. Lift the parchment paper on 2 opposite sides to meet in the middle above the salmon. Tightly fold down paper until it reaches salmon, crimping to seal. Roll up and crimp the ends to seal. Be sure the paper is sealed snugly so that steam won't escape during cooking. Secure folds with toothpicks, if you like. Place the packets on a rimmed baking sheet.
4. Roast in the preheated oven until salmon flakes easily with a fork, about 30 minutes. Carefully open packets and transfer salmon to serving plates.
