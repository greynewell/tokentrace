## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 4 tablespoons white sugar, divided
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ½ cup butter, cut into chunks
- 1 cup fresh blueberries
- ¾ cup buttermilk
- 1  egg white, lightly beaten
- 1 tablespoon powdered sugar, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Coat 2 baking sheets with cooking spray.
2. Whisk flour, 3 tablespoons sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and nutmeg together in a large bowl. Cut in butter with 2 knives or a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse meal. Stir blueberries and buttermilk into the flour mixture until combined.
3. Gather dough into a ball and knead on a lightly floured board for 2 minutes. Then roll dough out into a 3/4-inch-thick slab. Cut into 3-inch triangles with a sharp knife and distribute scones evenly onto the prepared baking sheets. Brush tops with egg white and sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon sugar.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 15 minutes. Remove from the baking sheets and place on cooling racks. Dust tops with powdered sugar; serve warm.
