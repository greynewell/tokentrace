## Ingredients

- 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- ¼ cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup butter, room temperature
- ¾ cup brown sugar
- ¾ cup white sugar
- 2  large eggs
- 2 tablespoons vanilla extract
- ½ cup chocolate-hazelnut spread, such as Nutella®
- ½ cup chopped toasted hazelnuts
- 1 cup chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet or line it with parchment paper.
2. Combine flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl. Mix with a whisk to break up any lumps.
3. Beat butter, brown sugar, and white sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Beat in eggs one at a time until completely incorporated. Mix in vanilla and chocolate-hazelnut spread.
4. Slowly add in flour mixture and stir just until combined. Fold in chopped hazelnuts and chocolate chips. Drop the dough onto prepared baking sheet by tablespoons or with a cookie scoop.
5. Bake in preheated oven until edges look dry and cookies are fragrant, about 12 minutes. Allow to cool for 1 minute on baking sheet before transferring to a wire rack.
