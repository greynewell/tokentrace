## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- ¾ cup milk, room temperature
- 3  eggs, room temperature
- ¾ cup water
- ½ cup beef drippings

## Instructions

1. Mix together flour and salt in a large bowl; form a well in the center. Add milk and whisk until combined. Beat in eggs until incorporated. Add water; beat until mixture is light and frothy. Cover and set aside at room temperature for 1 hour (or, if it's the day before, store covered in the refrigerator for 8 hours to overnight).
