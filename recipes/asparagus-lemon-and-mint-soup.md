## Ingredients

- 1 pound fresh asparagus, trimmed
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1  shallot, chopped
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint
- sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 2 cups chicken stock, or more if needed
- 1 teaspoon lemon zest
- 1  hard-boiled egg, chopped

## Instructions

1. Cut tips from 6 asparagus spears, about 1 1/2 inches from the top; reserve for garnish later. Chop the remaining asparagus into chunks.
2. Heat olive oil in a soup pot over medium heat; cook and stir shallot in the hot oil until softened, about 3 minutes. Add chopped asparagus; season with mint, salt, and pepper. Cook until asparagus are slightly tender, about 3 minutes.
