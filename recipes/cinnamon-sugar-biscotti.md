## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ⅔ cup white sugar
- 6 tablespoons butter
- 1  egg
- 1  egg yolk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1  egg, beaten
- 3 tablespoons white sugar
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Sift together flour, 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon, baking powder, and salt; set aside.
3. In a medium bowl, cream together 2/3 cup sugar and butter. Beat in egg, egg yolk, and vanilla. Stir in flour mixture.
4. On a lightly floured surface, divide dough in half. Roll each piece into a log about 9-inches long and 1 1/2-inches wide. Place logs on the prepared baking sheet and flatten slightly. Brush with beaten egg.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until golden and firm to the touch, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes.
6. On a cutting board, slice each log crosswise at a diagonal into 1/2-inch-thick slices using a serrated knife. Place cut-side down onto the baking sheet. Combine 3 tablespoons sugar and 1 teaspoon cinnamon in a small bowl; sprinkle over biscotti.
7. Return to the oven until toasted, 15 to 20 more minutes. Cool on wire racks and store in an airtight container.
