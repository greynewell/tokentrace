## Ingredients

- 1 cup warm water
- 1 cup white sugar
- ⅔ cup sourdough starter
- 2 teaspoons rapid-rise yeast
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 3 ⅔ cups unbleached all-purpose flour
- ⅓ cup flaxseed meal

## Instructions

1. Combine water, sugar, sourdough starter, yeast, and salt in a large mixing bowl.
2. Stir in flour and flaxseed meal.
3. Knead dough with either your hands or an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment for 5 minutes.
4. Place dough in a greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise for 2 hours.
5. Punch the dough down, turn onto a lightly floured surface, and knead briefly to shape into a ball.
6. Place in a bowl lined with parchment paper.
7. Cover with a kitchen towel and allow to rise until doubled in size, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
8. Meanwhile, place an empty 6-quart Dutch oven in the oven and preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C).
9. Slit the top of the loaf 1/4-inch deep with a very sharp knife.
10. Carefully place the dough, still on the parchment paper, into the hot Dutch oven and cover with the lid.
11. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes.
12. Remove the lid and continue to bake for 20 minutes more.
13. Remove bread from the Dutch oven and let cool on a wire rack for at least 1 hour before slicing.
