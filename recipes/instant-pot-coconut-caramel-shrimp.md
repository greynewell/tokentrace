## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons coconut water
- 7 tablespoons white sugar
- ½ cup coconut water
- ¼ cup fish sauce
- 1 pound uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger root
- 1 tablespoon finely grated garlic
- ¼ teaspoon crushed black pepper
- 2 teaspoons tapioca flour

## Instructions

1. Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and select Saute function on high heat. Set timer to a total of 10 minutes. Add 3 tablespoons coconut water and sugar. Stir just once, then leave alone to bubble.
2. Meanwhile, place 1/2 cup coconut water in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high until hot, 1 to 3 minutes.
3. Once pressure cooker reads "Hot" the coconut water-sugar mixture should be an amber color. Carefully pour the hot coconut water into the pot, using caution as this will cause steam to rise.
4. Add in fish sauce and shrimp. Hit Cancel. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 3 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
5. Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Once steam is released, remove lid and add in grated ginger, garlic, and pepper. Stir to combine.
6. Hit Cancel and switch to Saute mode. Stir in tapioca flour and whisk to combine. Cook until sauce thickens slightly, about 2 minutes.
