## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons grapeseed oil
- ½  red onion, thinly sliced
- 8 slices German rye bread
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 4 slices smoked Gouda cheese
- 4 slices provolone cheese
- ¼ cup marinated artichoke hearts, drained and chopped

## Instructions

1. Heat grapeseed oil in a large skillet over medium heat; saute onion until softened and slightly browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer onion to a small bowl, reserving the oil in the skillet.
2. Lightly brush each bread slice with grapeseed oil from the skillet and season with salt and pepper. Arrange half the bread slices, oil-side down, in the skillet. Top each bread slice with 1 slice Gouda cheese, 1 slice provolone cheese, artichoke hearts, and onion; top with remaining bread slices, oil-side up.
3. Cook sandwiches until bread is browned and crispy and cheeses are melted, about 4 minutes per side. Slice each sandwich in half to serve.
