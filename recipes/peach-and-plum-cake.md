## Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon unsalted butter, or as needed
- 1 ½ cups white sugar, divided
- 1 stick unsalted butter, room temperature
- 2 extra large eggs
- 1 cup plain yogurt
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 5 medium ripe plums, pitted and sliced
- 3 large  ripe peaches - peeled, pitted, and sliced

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 9-inch square baking pan.
2. Beat 1 cup sugar and 1 stick butter together using an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating after each addition. Add yogurt and vanilla extract; mix until batter is smooth. Add flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt to the batter and mix until just combined. Combine remaining 1/2 cup sugar and cinnamon in a separate bowl.
3. Spread batter evenly into the prepared pan and sprinkle with 1/2 of the cinnamon-sugar mixture. Top batter with plums and peaches; sprinkle with remaining cinnamon-sugar mixture.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 45 minutes to 1 hour, making sure not to overbake. Serve warm or at room temperature.
