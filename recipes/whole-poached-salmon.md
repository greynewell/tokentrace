## Ingredients

- 1 (750 milliliter) bottle dry white wine
- 1  onion, thinly sliced
- 1 rib celery, sliced
- 6  whole peppercorns
- 1  bay leaf
- 1  whole salmon, cleaned
- 1 bunch fresh dill
- 1  lemon, sliced

## Instructions

1. Combine wine, onion, celery, peppercorns, and bay leaf in a fish poacher. Place poacher over 2 burners on the stove.
2. Rinse fish under cold water, stuff the cavity with dill and lemon slices, and place on the rack in the pot. Cover and bring slowly to a strong simmer (don't boil at any point). Cook until fish easily flakes with a fork, being sure not to overcook, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Drain and serve.
