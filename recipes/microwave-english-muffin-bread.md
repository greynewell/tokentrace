## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon yellow cornmeal
- ¼ cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
- 1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
- 1 cup lukewarm milk
- 2 teaspoons white sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ⅛ teaspoon baking soda
- 1 cup whole wheat flour
- 2 cups all-purpose flour

## Instructions

1. Lightly grease a 9x5-inch microwave-safe loaf pan and sprinkle with cornmeal.
2. Pour water into a large bowl. Add yeast and stir to dissolve. Add milk, sugar, salt, and baking soda, then add whole wheat flour; beat until well combined. Beat in all-purpose flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until a soft dough forms.
3. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth, about 5 minutes. Shape dough into a loaf and place into the prepared pan.
4. Cook, uncovered, in a 650-watt microwave oven set at 50% power for 1 minute. Let rest for 10 minutes.
5. Repeat Step 4 one or two times, until loaf has doubled in size.
6. Microwave on high until top of loaf is no longer moist, 4 to 6 minutes.
7. Remove from the microwave and let stand in the pan for 5 minutes. Remove to a wire rack to finish cooling.
