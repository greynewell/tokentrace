## Ingredients

- 2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
- ½ cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
- 1 ½ cups lukewarm milk
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ cup molasses
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 3 ¼ cups rye flour
- 2 ½ cups bread flour

## Instructions

1. Dissolve yeast in warm water.
2. In a large bowl combine milk, sugar, and salt. Use a mixer to beat in molasses, butter, yeast mixture, and 1 cup of rye flour.
3. Use a wooden spoon to mix in the remaining rye flour. Add white flour by stirring until the dough is stiff enough to knead.
