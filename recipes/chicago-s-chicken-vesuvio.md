## Ingredients

- 2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken pieces
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- ¼ cup olive oil
- 2 cups Yukon Gold potato wedges
- ½  onion, chopped
- 5 cloves garlic, sliced
- ⅔ cup dry white wine
- ⅔ cup chicken stock
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
- 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
- 1 tablespoon butter, or more as needed
- ½ cup frozen peas

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Dry chicken pieces well and season liberally with salt and pepper.
2. Heat olive oil in an oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Add chicken, skin-side down, and cook until skin is crisp, 5 to 7 minutes. Turn over and cook until golden brown on the other side, 4 to 5 more minutes. Remove chicken and set aside.
3. Add potatoes, onion, and garlic to the skillet and cook until onion is translucent and potato wedges start to brown nicely on cut sides, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove vegetables from the skillet and set aside.
4. Pour wine into the skillet and cook until reduced by 1/2 while scraping the browned bits of food off the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon.
5. Add potatoes, onion, and garlic back into the skillet. Stir in chicken stock, parsley, and Italian seasoning. Add chicken pieces on top; cover with an oven-safe lid.
6. Cook in the preheated oven until chicken is cooked through and no longer pink at the bone, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
7. Return the skillet to the stove and remove chicken and vegetables, leaving the liquid; bring to a simmer. Add butter and stir until smooth, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Add peas and cook 1 to 2 minutes longer. Serve chicken atop potato wedges and garnish with pan sauce and peas.
