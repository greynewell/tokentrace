## Ingredients

- 1 head broccoli, cut into florets
- 3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- 2 pinches salt to taste
- ½ (16 ounce) package linguine pasta
- 6  anchovy fillets in olive oil, drained
- 3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
- ½ teaspoon red pepper flakes, or more to taste
- 1 pinch ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Set an oven rack about 8 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Toss broccoli in a bowl with 1 tablespoon olive oil and salt; spread on a large baking sheet.
2. Broil in the preheated oven until broccoli is tender and beginning to brown, 5 to 10 minutes.
3. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes.
4. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over low heat. Add anchovies, garlic, and red pepper flakes; cook and stir until anchovies dissolve into the oil, 3 to 5 minutes. Season with pepper. Mix in roasted broccoli.
5. Drain pasta and return to the pot. Add broccoli-anchovy mixture and mix well. Drizzle remaining olive oil on top.
