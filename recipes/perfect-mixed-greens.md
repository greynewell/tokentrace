## Ingredients

- 2 bunches collard greens
- 2 bunches mustard greens
- 2 bunches turnip greens
- 3 tablespoons salt
- 4 cups chicken broth, divided
- ½ cup vegetable oil
- 4 cloves garlic, sliced
- ½ cup cooked real bacon bits
- ½ cup white sugar
- salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Remove leaves from collard, mustard, and turnip greens; discard stems. Gently wash leaves in warm water to remove all soil and sand. Partially fill a clean sink with warm water; stir in 2 cups chicken broth and 3 tablespoons salt. Allow greens to soak in chicken broth mixture for 10 minutes.
2. Scoop greens into a colander and allow to drain; do not rinse. Discard chicken broth mixture down the sink.
3. Pour remaining 2 cups chicken broth into a large pot; mix in greens. Stir in vegetable oil, bacon bits, sugar, garlic, salt, and pepper; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until greens are tender, 45 minutes to 1 hour.
