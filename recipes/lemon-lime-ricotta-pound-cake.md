## Ingredients

- 3 ⅛ cups all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground cardamom
- ¼ teaspoon ground ginger
- 2 cups whole-milk ricotta cheese, at room temperature
- 2 cups white sugar
- 1 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 6 large eggs, at room temperature
- 2 tablespoons lemon zest
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 2 tablespoons grated lime zest
- 1 ½ tablespoons lime juice
- 1 cup powdered sugar
- 4 tablespoons heavy cream
- 1 pinch salt
- 2 teaspoons lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon lemon zest
- 2 teaspoons lime juice
- 1 teaspoon grated lime zest

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10-inch fluted tube pan (such as Bundt®).
2. Sift flour, baking soda, salt, cardamom, and ginger together in a large bowl. Set aside.
3. Beat ricotta, sugar, and butter together in a separate large bowl on medium-high speed until mixture is very light, 7 to 9 minutes. Mixture will look almost grainy and curdled--that is normal. Add eggs, 1 at a time, mixing well after each addition. Beat mixture on high speed for another 3 to 4 minutes. Mix in lemon zest and juice and lime zest and juice, until thoroughly incorporated. Add dry ingredients in three separate additions, mixing until only just combined after each addition.
4. Pour batter evenly into prepared pan and smooth the top. Tap pan on the counter a few times to remove any air bubbles.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until a bamboo skewer inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 55 to 60 minutes. Cool cake in the pan for 15 minutes before gently running a knife around the edges and center of the pan to loosen. Invert cake onto a wire rack to cool completely.
6. To make the icing: whisk together powdered sugar, heavy cream, and salt until completely smooth. Add in lemon and lime zests and juices and mix until thoroughly combined. Pour icing over the cooled cake.
