## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons kosher salt
- 1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 tablespoon smoked paprika
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons onion powder
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1 (7 pound) pork shoulder roast
- Unbleached parchment paper
- Heavy duty aluminum foil

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C).
2. Mix salt, black pepper, paprika, brown sugar, onion powder, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl.
3. Sprinkle rub mixture evenly and thoroughly on each surface of the pork roast, pressing it onto the surface.
4. Cut a 4-foot piece of unbleached parchment. Place roast at one end and roll roast tightly in the parchment. Cut a second piece of parchment and roll the roast, positioning it in the opposite direction before rolling.
5. Cut a long piece of heavy duty aluminum foil and tightly wrap the parchment-wrapped roast. Wrap the roast in a second piece of foil, and then a third, rotating the position of the roast each time. Place wrapped roast in a roasting pan with folded edges facing up to minimize leaking.
6. Place in preheated oven and roast until tender, about 12 1/2 hours (or 1.75 hours per pound of pork).
7. Remove pan from oven and allow the wrapped roast to rest at least 1 hour before unwrapping. Brush roast with accumulated juices in the parchment paper.
