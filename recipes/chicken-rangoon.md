## Ingredients

- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- 1 pinch onion powder, or to taste
- 1 pinch garlic powder, or to taste
- 1 dash Worcestershire sauce, or to taste
- 1 dash soy sauce, or to taste
- 1 pinch salt, or to taste
- 1 pinch ground black pepper, or to taste
- 1 cup chopped cooked chicken
- 1 (16 ounce) package wonton wrappers
- peanut oil for frying

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or deep, large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Stir cream cheese, onion powder, garlic powder, Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Add chicken and stir until completely incorporated.
3. Separate and place wonton wrappers onto work surface. Spoon about 1 teaspoon of the cream cheese filling onto the center of each wrapper. Use your finger or a pastry brush to lightly moisten the edges of the wonton wrappers with water. Fold one corner of the wrapper over the filling onto the opposite corner to form a triangle. Press the edges together to seal.
4. Working in batches, cook wontons in hot oil until wonton is lightly browned, 2 to 4 minutes. Remove to paper towel-lined plate to drain.
