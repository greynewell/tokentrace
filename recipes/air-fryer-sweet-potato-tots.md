## Ingredients

- 2  sweet potatoes, peeled
- ½ teaspoon Cajun seasoning
- olive oil cooking spray
- sea salt to taste

## Instructions

1. Bring a pot of water to a boil and add sweet potatoes. Boil until potatoes can be pierced with a fork but are still firm, about 15 minutes. Do not over-boil, or they will be messy to grate. Drain and let cool.
2. Grate sweet potatoes into a bowl using a box grater. Carefully mix in Cajun seasoning. Form mixture into tot-shaped cylinders.
3. Spray the air fryer basket with olive oil spray. Place tots in the basket in a single row without touching each other or the sides of the basket. Spray tots with olive oil spray and sprinkle with sea salt.
4. Heat air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) and cook tots for 8 minutes. Turn, spray with more olive oil spray, and sprinkle with more sea salt. Cook for 8 minutes more.
