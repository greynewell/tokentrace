## Ingredients

- 2  russet potatoes, peeled
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 1 teaspoon seasoned pepper
- ½ teaspoon onion powder
- 2 cups peanut oil

## Instructions

1. Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 10 minutes; drain and cool until easily handled, 10 to 15 minutes.
2. Shred potatoes with a box grater; drain excess water. Transfer shredded potato into a large mixing bowl; stir in parsley, flour, salt, seasoned pepper, and onion powder until combined. Shape potato mixture into 1-inch long potato nuggets.
3. Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
4. Lower potato nuggets carefully into the hot oil in batches, about 5 to 10 at a time. Fry until golden brown and crispy, about 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Repeat with remaining nuggets.
