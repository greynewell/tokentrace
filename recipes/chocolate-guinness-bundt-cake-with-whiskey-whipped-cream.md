## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ cups white sugar
- ½ cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¾ cup Irish stout beer (such as Guinness®)
- ¾ cup buttermilk
- ½ cup butter, melted and cooled
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1 tablespoon powdered sugar
- 1 tablespoon whiskey

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 10-inch fluted tube pan (such as Bundt®). Fit the bottom with a trimmed sheet of parchment paper and lightly grease the parchment.
2. Whisk flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl.
3. Whisk beer, buttermilk, and butter together in a separate, small bowl. Make a well in the dry ingredients and add the wet ingredients all at once. Whisk just until the batter is smooth; pour the batter into the prepared pan.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until the top gently springs back when touched and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes.
5. While the cake is still warm, run a thin metal spatula around the sides of the pan to loosen it; leave in the pan to cool for 5 minutes. Gently remove the cake and let cool completely on a rack before removing the sheet of parchment.
6. Whip heavy cream, powdered sugar, and whiskey together in a small bowl with an electric mixer until soft peaks have formed, about 3 minutes. Serve alongside the cake.
