## Ingredients

- 1 pound ground beef
- 1 cup crushed saltine crackers
- ½ cup chopped onion
- ½ cup chopped green bell pepper
- ⅓ cup milk
- 1  egg
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- 2 cloves garlic, chopped
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon seasoned salt
- ½ cup ketchup
- ½ cup brown sugar
- 4 cups mashed potatoes
- 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Mix ground beef, saltine crackers, onion, green bell pepper, milk, egg, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, black pepper, and seasoned salt together in a bowl.
3. Stir ketchup and brown sugar together in a bowl. Spoon ketchup mixture into the bottom of each muffin cup of a 6-cup muffin tin.
4. Fill muffin cups with beef mixture, leaving 1/2-inch space on the top.
