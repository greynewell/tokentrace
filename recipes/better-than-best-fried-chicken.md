## Ingredients

- 4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- 1 (10.75 ounce) can  condensed cream of chicken soup
- 1  egg
- seasoning salt to taste
- ½ cup all-purpose flour
- ½ cup cornstarch
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon paprika
- salt and pepper to taste
- oil for frying

## Instructions

1. Combine condensed soup, egg, and seasoning salt (be careful, as soup is already salted) in a shallow dish or bowl; mix well. Dip chicken in mixture and turn to coat completely. Set aside.
2. Mix together flour, cornstarch, garlic powder, paprika, salt, and pepper in a resealable plastic bag. Place chicken pieces, one at a time, in the bag, seal and shake to coat. Add more flour and cornstarch as necessary, but add them in equal parts.
3. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Be sure to use enough oil to cover chicken pieces.
4. Place coated chicken on a platter; allow to sit until outside becomes doughy (this is critical to ensure crispiness when fried). Once chicken coating is doughy, test oil by dropping a piece of coating into it; oil is ready if it starts to fry immediately.
5. Working in batches, fry chicken pieces in hot oil until cooked through and the juices run clear, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain on paper towels and serve.
