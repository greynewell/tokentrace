## Ingredients

- 2 cups uncooked white rice
- 4 cups water
- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 3  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into bite-size pieces
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce, or to taste
- ½ cup dry-roasted, unsalted peanuts
- 4  large leaves of iceberg lettuce
- 1 (11 ounce) can mandarin oranges, drained

## Instructions

1. Bring the rice and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat.
2. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
3. Let the rice stand, covered, while you finish the dish.
4. Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat until shimmering, and cook and stir the garlic until fragrant, about 1 minute.
5. Stir in the chicken, and cook and stir until seared and beginning to brown, about 5 minutes.
6. Stir in soy sauce and peanuts, and cook and stir until the chicken is no longer pink inside, and the soy sauce has coated the chicken and peanuts, 5 more minutes.
7. Remove the chicken mixture from the heat.
8. Line 4 plates with lettuce leaves, and scoop 1 cup of cooked rice onto each leaf.
9. Top with chicken-peanut mixture, and sprinkle each plate with mandarin orange slices.
