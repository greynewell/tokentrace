## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 12 ½ ounces skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- 3 ½ ounces carrots, julienned
- 3 ½ ounces white onion, thinly sliced
- 3 ½ ounces red onion, thinly sliced
- 2  bay leaves
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ cup red wine vinegar
- ¼ cup dry white wine
- ¼ cup water
- 1 teaspoon achiote powder
- ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper

## Instructions

1. Heat oil over medium-high heat in a Dutch oven. Add chicken to the hot oil and brown on 1 side, about 5 minutes. Flip chicken; add carrots, white onion, red onion, bay leaves, garlic, black pepper, and salt. Mix until vegetables have softened and chicken has browned, about 8 minutes.
2. Pour red wine vinegar, white wine, and water into the Dutch oven. Sprinkle with achiote powder and cayenne; stir well. Reduce heat to medium. Cover and simmer until chicken is no longer pink in the center and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 15 minutes.
