## Ingredients

- 6 slices rye bread
- 6 tablespoons butter, softened
- 1 pound ground beef
- ¾ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ teaspoon sea salt
- ¼ teaspoon onion powder
- 3 tablespoons mayonnaise
- 2 tablespoons ketchup
- 1 tablespoon real bacon bits
- 1 teaspoon sweet relish
- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- 6 slices Cheddar cheese
- 6 slices provolone cheese

## Instructions

1. Cover 1 side of each bread slice thoroughly and generously with butter; set aside.
2. Mix ground beef, pepper, salt, and onion powder together in a bowl until thoroughly combined, but do not overmix or meat will not have the proper consistency after it is cooked. Form 3 patties to fit the shape of the bread.
3. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add patties and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Flip, making sure patties do not break, and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce heat to low, and cook until no longer pink in the centers, about 5 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
4. While the burgers are cooking, combine mayonnaise, ketchup, bacon bits, relish, and sugar for sauce in a small bowl. Stir until mayonnaise and ketchup are well binded.
5. Heat another large skillet over medium-low heat. Place 1 slice bread in the skillet, buttered-side down. Top with 2 slices Cheddar cheese, a cooked patty, and 2 slices provolone cheese. Spread a thin layer of sauce on the unbuttered side of a second slice of bread, and place sauce-side down on top of provolone. Repeat to make remaining patty melts, working in batches if necessary.
6. Cook until bread is lightly toasted and cheese is melted, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
