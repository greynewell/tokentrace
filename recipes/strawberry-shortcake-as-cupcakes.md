## Ingredients

- 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ cup milk
- ½ cup vegetable oil
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 cup white sugar
- ½ cup butter
- 3 large eggs
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 pinch salt
- 2 cups heavy cream
- 2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 12  strawberries, halved
- 1 (10.5 ounce) package fresh blueberries

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line two 12-cup muffin tins with muffin cups.
2. Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a medium-sized bowl. Set aside.
3. Combine milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract in a separate bowl. Set aside.
4. Beat sugar and butter with an electric mixer until light and fluffy; add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix in flour and milk mixtures alternatively, both beginning and ending with flour, until thoroughly combined. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 3/4 full.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until golden and a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes. Let cool completely before transferring to a wire rack.
6. Meanwhile, place a medium-sized mixing bowl and whisk into the freezer for 5 to 10 minutes.
7. Beat cream cheese and sugar in a large mixing bowl with an electric mixer until smooth. Add vanilla and salt; combine. Set aside.
8. Remove the medium-sized mixing bowl and whisk out of the freezer. Pour heavy whipping cream into the bowl and whip until stiff peaks are about to form. Add confectioners' sugar and vanilla; whip until stiff peaks form, making sure not to overwhip.
9. Mix together cream cheese and whipped cream mixtures until combined. Frost cooled cupcakes and top with strawberries and blueberries.
