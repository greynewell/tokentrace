## Ingredients

- 1 (16 ounce) package egg noodles
- ¼ cup butter
- ¼ cup chopped onion
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic
- 6 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 cup milk
- 1 cup half-and-half
- 30 ounces chicken broth
- 1 (3 pound) rotisserie chicken, bones removed and meat cut into bite-size pieces
- 1 cup sour cream
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, 7 to 9 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large serving bowl.
2. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion and garlic in hot butter until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Place milk, half-and-half, and flour into a jar with a lid and shake until flour well combined. Pour mixture into the skillet and whisk until smooth and thick, about 5 minutes.
3. Gradually whisk in chicken broth; bring to a simmer while whisking constantly. Stir cooked chicken and sour cream into sauce; season with salt and black pepper. Add cooked noodles; stir until combined.
