## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 cups vegetable broth (such as Penzy's®)
- 2 (14.5 ounce) cans fire-roasted diced tomatoes
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro, divided
- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- ¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes
- ½ cup heavy whipping cream

## Instructions

1. Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes.
2. Pour vegetable broth over the onion mixture; add tomatoes, 1 tablespoon cilantro, sugar, and red pepper flakes. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, place a cover on the saucepan, and simmer until the tomatoes are really soft, about 15 minutes.
3. Pour tomato mixture into a blender no more than half full. Cover and hold lid in place; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth and return to the saucepan.
4. Put pureed soup over medium heat and cook until hot, about 5 minutes. Stir remaining tablespoon cilantro and the heavy cream into the soup.
