## Ingredients

- 1 cup brown rice
- 1 ⅔ cups water
- 3 tablespoons butter
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- ½ cup white wine
- 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
- 1 ½ pounds medium shrimp - peeled and deveined
- ¼ cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley

## Instructions

1. Combine the brown rice and water in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low and cook until all the water is absorbed, about 25 minutes.
2. Melt the butter with the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook the garlic in the butter and oil until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour in the wine and lemon juice; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer. Stir in the shrimp and cook until the shrimp turns pink, stirring regularly, 5 to 7 minutes.
