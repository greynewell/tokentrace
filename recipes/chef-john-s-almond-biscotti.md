## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon fine salt
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 2  large eggs
- ¼ teaspoon vanilla extract
- ¾ teaspoon almond extract
- ½ cup whole roasted almonds
- ½ cup chopped roasted almonds

## Instructions

1. Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a mixing bowl.
2. Place butter, 1 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar, olive oil in a separate mixing bowl. Mix together thoroughly until mixture has a creamy texture. Add 1 egg; mix into butter/sugar mixture. Whisk in 2nd egg, vanilla extract, and almond extract; whisk until smooth. Add flour mixture. Mix until flour is incorporated. Add whole almonds and chopped almonds; mix in evenly. Cover bowl with plastic wrap; refrigerate 30 minutes.
3. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with a silicone mat.
4. Divide dough in half. Place each half on a length of plastic wrap and shape into a log. Wrap with the plastic wrap and press into a shape about 3 or 4 inches wide and about 1/2 inch high. Transfer both pieces to prepared baking sheet leaving about 3 or 4 inches of space between them to allow for spreading.
5. Bake in center of preheated oven until turning golden and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Let cool 15 minutes before slicing.
6. Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
7. Cut each piece at a slight angle into 1/2- to 1 -inch thick slices with a serrated knife. Transfer pieces back to baking sheet in a single layer. Bake 12 minutes; remove from oven and flip pieces over. Return pan to oven and bake until biscotti are golden brown and crunchy, about 20 minutes.
8. Transfer biscotti to a cooling rack; let cool to room temperature.
