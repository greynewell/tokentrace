## Ingredients

- 1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
- 1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 quart vegetable oil for frying
- 2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar

## Instructions

1. Heat about 3 inches of oil in a saucepan to 375 degrees F (119 degrees C). In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in 1/2 cup warm water. Set aside for 10 minutes.
2. Sir the remaining 1/2 cup water into the bowl. Add flour, beating vigorously until a soft dough forms.
3. Turn the dough out onto a smooth surface, and knead with greased hands until smooth. Place dough in a greased bowl, and turn to coat the surface. Cover with a damp cloth. Let rise in a warm place until double in bulk, about 1 to 1/1/2 hours.
4. Fry golf ball sizes of dough in batches until golden brown. Drain on paper towels. Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar, and eat while still hot.
