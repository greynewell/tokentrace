## Ingredients

- ¾ cup uncooked quinoa
- 1 ¼ cups low-sodium chicken broth
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 6 links Dietz & Watson Buffalo Chicken Sausage, cut into chunks
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 2 cups butternut squash, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
- 1 cup shredded carrot
- 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
- ½ teaspoon ground cumin
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 medium red bell pepper, diced
- ¼ cup fresh flat-leaf parsley, chopped

## Instructions

1. Put the quinoa and chicken broth in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer until the liquid is absorbed, 12 to 15 minutes. Fluff with a fork.
2. While quinoa cooks, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the sausage and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned, about 5 minutes. Transfer sausage to a plate.
3. Add another tablespoon oil to pan, then add the onion and cook until softened, about 3 minutes. Add the squash and carrots and cook about 5 minutes, until the vegetables are tender-firm.
4. In a large bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, remaining oil, cumin, salt and black pepper. Add quinoa, sausage, squash-carrot and onion mixture and mix. Chill in the refrigerator at least 30 minutes or up to two days. When ready to serve, stir in the parsley.
