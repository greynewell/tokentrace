## Ingredients

- 1 ½ pounds bacon, chopped
- 2 teaspoons butter
- 4 large yellow onions, diced
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ¼ cup brown sugar
- ¼ cup sherry vinegar
- 1 ½ teaspoons fresh thyme leaves, divided
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper
- ½ cup water
- 2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar
- 2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil

## Instructions

1. Warm a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Add bacon; cook and stir until crispy and rendered fat starts to foam, about 10 minutes. Pour bacon and rendered fat into a strainer placed over a bowl. When fat is drained and bacon is cool enough to handle, remove bacon to a cutting board and finely chop.
2. Return the pot to medium heat; drizzle 2 teaspoons reserved bacon fat and butter into the pot. Add onions and salt; cook until until soft and translucent, 7 to 10 minutes.
3. Stir brown sugar, sherry vinegar, 1 teaspoon thyme leaves, black pepper, and cayenne into onion mixture; add bacon. Stir water into bacon mixture and cook until jam has a brick-brown color and thick consistency, 10 to 15 minutes.
4. Remove from heat and add balsamic vinegar, olive oil, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon thyme; stir until shiny and heated through.
