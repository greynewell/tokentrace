## Ingredients

- 1 ½ pounds ground beef
- ½ medium onion, diced
- 1 medium red bell pepper, diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 cups beef broth
- ¾ cup ketchup
- 1 teaspoon prepared yellow mustard
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground white pepper
- 2 dashes Worcestershire sauce
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
- 1 large egg
- 1 tablespoon water
- 1 (14.1 ounce) package refrigerated pie dough for a double-crust pie
- 6 slices Cheddar cheese

## Instructions

1. Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir ground beef and onion in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 7 to 8 minutes. Add bell pepper and garlic; cook and stir until tender, 2 to 3 more minutes.
2. Add 1 cup beef broth, ketchup, mustard, brown sugar, salt, pepper, Worcestershire sauce, and cayenne pepper; bring to a simmer. Add remaining 1 cup broth and reduce heat to low. Simmer until mixture becomes very thick, 30 to 45 minutes. Taste and adjust for salt, pepper, and cayenne as needed.
3. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Whisk egg and water together in a small bowl.
4. Roll out both pie crusts on a lightly floured surface and cut out six 5-inch circles. Place a slice of Cheddar cheese in the center of each circle and top with Sloppy Joe mixture. Fold dough and seal the edges using a fork. Brush the outsides with egg wash and place hand pies on the prepared baking sheet.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.
