## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon butter
- 2  shallots, thinly sliced
- 2  pears - peeled, cored and sliced
- ⅓ cup dry white wine
- ½ teaspoon brown sugar
- ½ teaspoon chopped fresh thyme
- salt and pepper to taste
- 1 (8 ounce) round loaf sourdough bread
- 1 (8 ounce) round Brie cheese
- ½ cup slivered almonds
- Assorted crackers

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add shallot; cook and stir for 1 minute to soften. Add thinly sliced pears; cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Pour in white wine, brown sugar, thyme, salt, and pepper; increase heat to medium-high and simmer until the liquid has evaporated, and the pears have lightly caramelized, about 10 minutes. Set aside.
3. Cut a Brie-sized hole in the top of the sourdough bread to within 1/2-inch of the bottom. Cut the removed bread into pieces for serving, set aside. Score the Brie around it's edge, using a paring knife to cut 1/4-inch deep. Cut in half by looping an 18-inch piece of very thin string, or unflavored dental floss around the scored Brie and pulling the ends in opposite directions.
4. Place the bottom half of the Brie, cut-side-up, into the sourdough loaf. Top with 1/2 of the pear mixture and sprinkle with 1/2 of the slivered almonds. Place the remaining brie half on top, spread with remaining pear mixture, and sprinkle with remaining slivered almonds. Place on a baking sheet.
5. Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes or until soft and gooey. Serve with sliced sourdough bread and crackers.
