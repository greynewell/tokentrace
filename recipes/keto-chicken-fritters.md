## Ingredients

- 1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into halves
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon paprika
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ cup shredded mozzarella cheese
- 2 tablespoons mayonnaise
- 1  egg, lightly beaten
- 2  green onions, minced
- 2 tablespoons plain unsweetened protein powder (such as Isopure®)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided

## Instructions

1. Combine chicken pieces, salt, paprika, pepper, and garlic powder in the bowl of a food processor; pulse until meat is coarsely chopped into 1/4- to 1/2-inch pieces. Do not overprocess.
2. Transfer chicken mixture to a bowl. Add mozzarella cheese, mayonnaise, egg, and green onions; mix to combine. Sprinkle protein powder on top and mix together until evenly combined. Set aside for flavors to blend, 20 to 30 minutes; the mixture will be wet.
3. Preheat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Use a 1/4-cup measuring cup to scoop 4 slightly heaping portions into the skillet. Press down on each fritter slightly to form a small patty. Cook until no longer pink in the center and fritters are golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
4. Remove fritters and drain on a paper towel-lined plate; keep warm. Repeat with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and chicken mixture. Serve immediately.
