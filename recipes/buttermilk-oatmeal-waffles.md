## Ingredients

- 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ cups rolled oats
- 3 tablespoons white sugar
- 2 tablespoons baking powder
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt
- 4  eggs, separated
- 1 ½ cups buttermilk
- 1 cup milk
- ½ cup butter, melted
- 1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions. Mix flour, oats, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl.
2. Beat egg yolks in another bowl, reserving egg whites in a third bowl. Add buttermilk, milk, and melted butter to egg yolks; beat until well mixed. Pour buttermilk mixture into flour mixture; beat until batter is blended.
3. Beat egg whites and vanilla extract in a glass or metal bowl until soft peaks form. Fold half the egg whites into the buttermilk batter until egg whites are incorporated; repeat with remaining half.
