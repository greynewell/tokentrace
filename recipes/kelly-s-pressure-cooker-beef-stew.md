## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- ½ cup all-purpose flour
- 1 ¼ pounds beef stew meat, cubed
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 2 cups water
- 2 cubes beef bouillon
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1  bay leaf
- 1 tablespoon dried parsley
- 1 tablespoon dried basil
- 4  potatoes, peeled and cut into 2-inch pieces
- 2 cups peeled baby carrots

## Instructions

1. Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Place flour in a resealable bag; drop in half the beef cubes and shake to coat. Shake off excess flour and add meat to pan. Repeat with remaining beef. Season meat with salt and pepper to taste.
2. Stir onion into beef and cook, stirring often, until the meat is browned on all sides and onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle in sugar.
3. Combine water, beef bouillon, garlic, bay leaf, parsley, and basil in a pressure cooker over medium-high heat. When bouillon cubes are dissolved, fit the pressure cooker's rack in the cooker (if it has one). Layer potatoes, carrots, and meat mixture in the pressure cooker, seasoning with salt and pepper to taste. Seal the lid and bring the cooker up to full pressure.
4. Reduce heat to medium-low, maintaining full pressure, and cook for 8 minutes. Remove from heat. Let the pressure drop naturally, about 15 minutes before releasing lid. Transfer the meat and vegetables to a serving bowl and pour pan juices over meat and vegetables.
