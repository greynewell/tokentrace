## Ingredients

- 1 pound cubed beef stew meat
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1  onion, thinly sliced
- 1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can low fat, low sodium beef broth
- 1 cup chopped carrots
- 3  potatoes, cubed
- 1 sprig fresh rosemary
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1  bay leaf
- ¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
