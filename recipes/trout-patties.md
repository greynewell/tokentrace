## Ingredients

- 3 pounds skinless, boneless trout fillets
- 3 tablespoons butter
- 3 tablespoons lemon juice
- 1 small onion, chopped
- 1 stalk celery, finely chopped
- ½ cup seasoned bread crumbs
- 3  eggs
- 2 tablespoons mayonnaise
- 1 ½ teaspoons lemon pepper seasoning
- vegetable oil for frying
- ¾ cup ketchup
- 2 tablespoons prepared horseradish

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place a piece of aluminum foil large enough to wrap trout fillets into a 9x13-inch baking dish.
2. Start the patties: Place trout fillets on the foil in the prepared pan; drizzle butter and lemon juice over trout. Fold the aluminum foil and seal the edges to enclose trout in a packet.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 1 hour.
4. Meanwhile, make the cocktail sauce: Mix ketchup and horseradish together in a small bowl until well combined. Refrigerate until needed.
5. Finish the patties: Remove trout from the oven and let cool for 10 minutes. Flake fish into a large bowl. Add bread crumbs, onion, and celery; mix to combine.
6. Whisk eggs, mayonnaise, and lemon-pepper seasoning together in a small bowl until blended. Add to trout mixture and mix until combined. Form mixture into 12 patties.
7. Heat 1/4 inch oil in a deep skillet over medium heat. Working in batches, fry patties until deep golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes per side.
8. Serve patties with reserved cocktail sauce.
