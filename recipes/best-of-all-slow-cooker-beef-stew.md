## Ingredients

- ⅓ cup all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon garlic salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 2 pounds beef for stew, cut into 1-inch cubes
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1  onion, chopped
- 1 ½ cups beef broth
- ½ cup red wine
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- 3  potatoes, diced

## Instructions

1. Whisk flour, garlic salt, and black pepper together in a small bowl; pour into a large resealable plastic bag. Place stew beef in bag, seal the bag, and shake to coat beef to coat completely.
2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; saute coated beef in hot oil until browned on all sides, about 10 minutes. Stir onion into beef; saute until onion is softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Pour beef and onions into a slow cooker.
