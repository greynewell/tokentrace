## Ingredients

- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, at room temperature
- 1 ½ cups shredded extra-sharp Cheddar cheese, divided
- 1 cup shredded pepper Jack cheese
- 2 tablespoons mayonnaise
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tablespoon hot pepper sauce (such as Tabasco®)
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
- ¼ teaspoon onion powder
- ¼ teaspoon garlic powder

## Instructions

1. Beat cream cheese, 1 cup Cheddar cheese, pepper Jack, mayonnaise, Worcestershire, hot sauce, parsley, onion powder, and garlic powder with an electric mixer on low speed until creamy, about 1 minute. Beat in remaining 1/2 cup Cheddar until just combined, about 15 seconds.
