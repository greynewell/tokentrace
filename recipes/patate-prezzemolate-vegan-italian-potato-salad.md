- 25 ounces Yukon Gold potatoes
- 1 tablespoon rock salt
- 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
- 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
- 2 cloves garlic, peeled and slightly crushed
- 2  green onions (white part only), chopped
- ½ cup very finely chopped flat-leaf parsley
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

3. Peel cooked and cooled potatoes and cut into 1-inch cubes. Combine potatoes, green onions, and parsley in a bowl and lightly toss. Season with salt and pepper. Drizzle with olive oil mixture and lightly toss, taking care not to break the potatoes.
