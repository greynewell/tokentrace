## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 2 large onions, sliced
- 12 (4 ounce) beef eye of round steaks
- ¼ teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 teaspoon seasoned salt
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour for coating
- 1 cup beef consomme
- 1 cup Burgundy wine
- 1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions; cook and stir until lightly browned and tender, about 5 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer onions to a bowl.
2. Season steaks with seasoned salt and thyme, then dust lightly with flour. Fry steaks in the skillet over medium-high heat until browned, about 5 minutes per side.
