## Ingredients

- 3 ½ pounds beef brisket
- 1  white onion, halved
- 3 cloves garlic
- 3  bay leaves
- salt to taste
- water to cover
- 6 small guajillo chile peppers, seeded and deveined
- 2 small ancho chile peppers, seeded and deveined
- 3 tablespoons white vinegar
- 2 cloves garlic
- 4  whole cloves
- 3  whole allspice berries
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon dried oregano
- ¼ teaspoon dried thyme
- ¼ teaspoon cumin seeds
- ¼ teaspoon ground ginger
- 1 pinch ground cinnamon
- salt to taste

## Instructions

1. Place brisket in a stovetop pressure cooker. Add onion, garlic, bay leaves, and salt; cover with water. Close cooker securely and place pressure regulator over vent according to manufacturer's instructions. Heat until steam escapes in a steady flow and makes a whistling sound, about 10 minutes. Adjust temperature until regulator is gently rocking. Cook for 60 minutes.
2. Let pressure release naturally according to manufacturer's instructions, 5 to 10 minutes. Unlock lid and remove.
3. Remove brisket from the pressure cooker and shred with 2 forks. Strain the cooking liquid, discarding solids. Measure 2 cups for the barbacoa sauce and save the rest for another use.
4. Combine guajillo chile peppers and ancho chile peppers in a saucepan. Cover with water, bring to a boil, and cook for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand in the hot water until softened, about 5 minutes. Drain.
5. Combine softened chile peppers, vinegar, garlic, cloves, allspice, black pepper, oregano, thyme, cumin, ginger, cinnamon and reserved 2 cups cooking liquid; blend until thick and very smooth.
6. Pour sauce into a heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat and season with salt. Bring to a soft boil; reduce the heat to low. Stir in shredded beef, coating completely with sauce. Cover pot and cook until flavors combine, at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour.
