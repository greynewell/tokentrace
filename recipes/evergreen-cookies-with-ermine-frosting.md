## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups milk
- ½ cup all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ cups white sugar
- ¾ cup unsalted butter, softened
- ¾ cup shortening
- 1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 ½ teaspoons almond extract
- 4 drops green gel food coloring, or as desired
- 1 tablespoon white sugar, or as needed
- ½ cup unsalted butter, softened
- ½ cup shortening
- ½ cup white sugar
- ½ cup powdered sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract
- 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon cream of tartar
- ½ teaspoon salt

## Instructions

1. Stir milk and 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon flour together in a small saucepan. Cook, stirring constantly, over medium heat until thickened and bubbly, about 5 minutes. Pour into a bowl; place a piece of plastic wrap directly on the surface to prevent a skin from forming. Let cool completely, about 30 minutes.
2. Transfer cooled milk mixture to a large bowl. Add white sugar, butter, shortening, vanilla extract, and almond extract. Beat with an electric mixer on high speed until frosting is light and creamy, about 5 minutes. Divide frosting among 3 small bowls and tint by beating in enough food coloring to achieve 3 distinct shades of green. Transfer to piping bags fitted with small, medium, and large star tips.
3. Position racks in upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease 2 large baking sheets. Place 1 tablespoon sugar on a small rimmed plate.
4. Beat butter, shortening, 1/2 cup white sugar, and powdered sugar for cookies together with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in egg and vanilla extract.
5. Whisk flour, baking soda, cream of tartar, and salt together in another bowl. Stir flour mixture into butter mixture.
6. Shape into 1 1/2-inch balls. Arrange 2 inches apart on prepared pans. Dip the bottom of a glass in water; then in the plate of white sugar. Press balls to flatten slightly with the sugar-rimmed glass bottom.
7. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes, rotating pans halfway through. Transfer to a wire rack and cool completely, 10 to 15 minutes more.
8. Pipe frosting onto cookies as desired, making wreaths or trees.
