## Ingredients

- 1 clove garlic, chopped
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 4 (6 ounce) salmon fillets
- ½ cup butter
- 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- ¼ cup white wine
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon garlic salt
- 1 ½ teaspoons fines herbs
- ¼ cup chopped fresh dill

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven broiler; set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. Line a jelly roll pan with aluminum foil; spray with nonstick cooking spray.
2. Place garlic and olive oil in a small microwave-safe bowl. Cook on high in the microwave for 1 1/2 minutes. Melt butter in a saucepan over low heat; stir in garlic mixture. Remove from heat; stir in white wine, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, fines herbes, black pepper, and garlic salt.
3. Place salmon fillets skin-side down on the prepared pan. Spoon about 1/3 of the butter sauce over fillets; sprinkle evenly with fresh dill.
4. Broil in the preheated oven for 3 minutes. Turn fillets so that a side faces up and baste fillets with about 1/3 of the butter sauce; broil for 3 minutes. Turn fillets so the opposite side faces up and baste with remaining butter sauce; broil until fillets flake easily with a fork, about 3 more minutes.
