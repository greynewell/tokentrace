## Ingredients

- 1 ½ pounds ground beef
- 1  onion, chopped
- ⅜ cup raisins, chopped
- 1 ½ teaspoons chopped flat leaf parsley

2. In a large bowl, mix together ground beef, onion, raisins, and parsley. Season with cayenne pepper, cinnamon, coriander, nutmeg, sugar, salt, and pepper, and mix well. Form into 6 flat sausages around skewers. Lightly brush sausages with oil; this prevents sticking to the grill.
