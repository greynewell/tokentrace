## Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon butter
- 4 large shallots, peeled and sliced
- 1 pinch salt
- 1 cup red wine
- 2 cups veal stock
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Add shallots and a pinch of salt; cook and stir shallots until caramelized and browned, about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.
2. Add red wine and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low; cook until wine is nearly evaporated and pan juices are thick and slightly syrupy. Watch carefully as the mixture burns easily. Add veal stock, return to a simmer, and cook until reduced by half and sauce is slightly thickened, about 10 minutes.
3. Pour sauce through a fine mesh strainer set over a container. Tap the strainer with a spoon while straining and squeeze out the last remaining drops of sauce from the residue. Season sauce to taste with salt and black pepper.
