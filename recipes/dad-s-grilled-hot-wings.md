## Ingredients

- 5 pounds chicken wings
- ¼ teaspoon poultry seasoning salt, or to taste
- 1 dash garlic salt
- freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 1 (8 ounce) bottle Buffalo wing sauce (such as Frank's RedHot®)
- ¼ cup butter

## Instructions

1. Cut wings into sections and discard tips. Season with poultry seasoning salt, garlic salt, and black pepper.
2. Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
3. Cook wings on the grill, turning occasionally, until skin is golden brown, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove wings from grill; keep grill hot.
4. Pour hot sauce into a deep, microwave-safe serving dish; add butter. Heat in a microwave oven until butter is melted, about 1 minute. Stir to combine.
5. Dip grilled wings into sauce and return to the hot grill. Cook for 3 minutes. Dip wings in sauce a second time; return to grill and cook 3 to 5 minutes more. Place wings in serving dish with remaining sauce.
