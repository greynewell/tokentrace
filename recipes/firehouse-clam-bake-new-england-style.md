## Instructions

1. At the beach dig a hole in the sand with the approximate proportions: width = 2 feet, length = 4 feet, depth = 1-1/2 feet.
2. Line the hole with stones from the beach.
3. Build a fire inside of the hole and cover with rocks from the beach.
4. Heat the stones for 2 to 3 hours.
5. Remove coals and/or embers from the hole.
6. Arrange hot stones evenly across the bottom of the hole.
7. Place fresh 1/2 bushel seaweed (wet) on top of the hot stones.
8. Working quickly layer the food on top of the seaweed, the food should be layered evenly on top of each other in the following order: clams, mussels, fish, sausage,  hotdogs (wrapped in cheesecloth), onions, potatoes (white and sweet), corn, and finally lobsters.
9. Cover food with a clean, wet cloth.
10. Place remaining seaweed on top of cloth.
11. Cover entire hole of food with a wet tarpaulin, sealing the steam created by the hot stones and seaweed in.
12. Allow a very small amount of steam to escape to relieve pressure.
13. Let bake cook for 1 or more hours.
14. The bake is completed when the potatoes are soft.
