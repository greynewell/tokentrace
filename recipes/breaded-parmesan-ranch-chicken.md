## Ingredients

- ¾ cup crushed corn flakes
- ¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 (1 ounce) envelope ranch salad dressing mix
- 8 (4 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- ½ cup butter, melted

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
2. Combine corn flakes, Parmesan cheese, and ranch dressing mix in a bowl. Dip chicken in melted butter; roll each chicken breast in corn flake mixture until evenly coated. Place coated chicken in the prepared baking dish.
