## Ingredients

- 2  potatoes
- 3 tablespoons margarine
- 2 cups chopped white onion
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 4 cups chicken stock
- 2 cups water
- ¼ cup cornstarch
- 1 ½ cups instant mashed potato flakes
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ¾ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ teaspoon dried basil
- ⅛ teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 cup half-and-half
- ½ cup shredded Cheddar cheese
- 8 ounces bacon - cooked and crumbled
- 2  green onions, chopped

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Bake potatoes for 1 hour, or until done. Set aside to cool.
2. Melt butter in a 3 quart saucepan over medium heat. Saute onions until tender and golden brown. Stir in flour, and cook 5 minutes to make a roux. Pour in chicken stock and water. Add cornstarch and mashed potato flakes. Season with salt, pepper, basil and thyme. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 5 minutes.
3. Remove the skin from the cooled potatoes, and discard. Dice the potatoes into 1/2 inch cubes, and stir into soup, along with the half-and-half. Simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, or until thick. Spoon into bowls, and garnish with shredded cheese, bacon and chopped green onion.
