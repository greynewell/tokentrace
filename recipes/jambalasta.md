## Ingredients

- 3 (8 ounce) packages linguine pasta
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1  onion, chopped
- 2  skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into strips
- 1 pound shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning
- 1 tablespoon paprika
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon Louisiana-style hot sauce
- 1 pound kielbasa, cut into 1/4-inch slices
- 1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 2 tablespoons cold water

## Instructions

1. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the linguine, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.
2. Heat the oil in a large skillet over high heat; cook and stir the onion in the oil until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the chicken, shrimp, sugar, Cajun seasoning, paprika, garlic powder, oregano, salt, and hot sauce and cook until the chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in the kielbasa and diced tomatoes. Whisk together the cornstarch and cold water in a small bowl until smooth; pour into the skillet. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until thickened, about 10 minutes. Ladle over the linguine.
