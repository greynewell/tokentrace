## Ingredients

- 1 pound ground beef
- ½ cup uncooked white rice
- ½ cup water
- ⅓ cup chopped onion
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon celery salt
- ⅛ teaspoon garlic powder
- ⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
- 1 cup water, or more as needed
- 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce

## Instructions

1. Mix ground beef, rice, 1/2 cup water, onion, salt, celery salt, garlic powder, and black pepper in a bowl. Roll mixture into 12 meatballs.
2. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place meatballs into the hot skillet; cook, turning occasionally, until evenly browned. Drain and discard excess grease.
3. Pour tomato sauce, 1 cup water, and Worcestershire sauce into the skillet; reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer until meatballs are no longer pink in the center and rice is tender, about 45 minutes. Stir in more water if sauce becomes too dry. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a meatball should read at least 160 degrees F (72 degrees C).
