## Ingredients

- 2 (1 ounce) bottles red food coloring
- 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
- ½ cup butter
- 1 ½ cups white sugar
- 2  eggs
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 cup buttermilk
- 2 ½ cups flour
- 1 ½ teaspoons baking soda
- 1 tablespoon white vinegar
- 8 ounces cream cheese, softened
- ½ cup butter, softened
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 ½ pounds confectioners' sugar, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour 2 9-inch cake pans.
2. Pour red food coloring into a small bowl, and mix with cocoa powder to make a paste. In a large bowl, beat 1/2 cup of butter, sugar, and eggs with an electric mixer until smooth and thoroughly combined; mix in the red color mixture, salt and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Gradually mix in the buttermilk, alternating with flour, until the batter is smooth. Mix the baking soda and vinegar in a small bowl, and stir into the batter. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pans.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a cake comes out clean, 25 to 35 minutes. Remove from oven, and cool in pans for 10 minutes before removing cakes to finish cooling on racks.
4. In a bowl, mash cream cheese with 1/2 cup softened butter and 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract until smooth and creamy; stir in the confectioners' sugar, about half a cup at a time, until the frosting is thick and spreadable. Frost fully-cooled layers.
