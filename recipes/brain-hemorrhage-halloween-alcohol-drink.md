## Ingredients

- 1 fluid ounce chilled peach schnapps
- 1 teaspoon chilled Irish cream liqueur (such as Bailey's®)

## Instructions

1. Pour schnapps into a shot glass.
2. Very gently pour Irish cream liqueur over the schnapps. Wait until the Irish cream liqueur begins to clump and 'curdle' to look like a brain, just a few moments.
3. Gently pour a tiny amount of grenadine 'blood' over the brain.
4. Watch your guests gag over the look of one of the nastiest-looking Halloween drinks around. But they are yummy!
