## Ingredients

- 1 pound cod, about 1-inch thick, cut into 4 pieces
- ¼ cup polenta
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ teaspoons seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®)
- 1 ½ teaspoons garlic salt
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ teaspoon paprika
- olive oil cooking spray

## Instructions

1. Preheat an air fryer to 380 degrees F (195 degrees C). Pat cod pieces dry with paper towels.
2. Combine polenta, flour, seafood seasoning, garlic salt, onion powder, pepper, and paprika in a shallow dish. Coat each piece of cod with the breading mixture, pressing breading on each side of the fish until well coated.
3. Spray the basket of the air fryer with olive oil cooking spray. Arrange cod in the basket, leaving space between each piece so air can circulate. Spray the top of each piece of cod with cooking spray.
4. Cook for 8 minutes. Turn each piece, spray with cooking spray, and cook for 4 minutes more.
