## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons ground paprika
- 1 tablespoon ground black pepper
- 1 tablespoon chili powder
- 1 tablespoon seasoned salt
- 2 teaspoons cayenne pepper
- 1 ½ teaspoons onion powder
- 1 ½ teaspoons garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon ground white pepper
- 1 teaspoon mustard powder
- 2 pounds chicken wings
- 2 cups vegetable oil, or as needed
- 2 cups peanut oil, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Mix paprika, black pepper, chili powder, seasoned salt, cayenne pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, white pepper, and mustard powder together in a bowl until seasoning mix is evenly combined. Dry chicken wings thoroughly with a paper towel.
2. Heat enough vegetable oil and peanut oil in a deep cast iron pot or heavy pot to reach a depth of about 2 inches; bring to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
3. Split wings into 2 batches and fry each batch in the hot oil, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer each batch to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.
4. Increase oil temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fry each batch of wings in the hot oil until skin is crispy, golden brown and meat is no longer pink in the center, 5 to 6 minutes. Drain wings on a paper towel-lined plate; transfer to a bowl.
5. Sprinkle seasoning mix over cooked wings and toss to evenly coat.
