## Ingredients

- 1 (8 ounce) package refrigerated crescent rolls
- ¾ cup dark brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons ground cinnamon
- 1 cup confectioners' sugar
- 2 tablespoons milk, or more as needed
- ¼ teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Unroll crescent roll dough onto a silicone baking mat or lightly greased work surface and separate into 4 rectangles; firmly press diagonal perforations with your fingers to smooth them out.
3. Mix brown sugar and cinnamon together in a small bowl; sprinkle mixture evenly over rectangles.
4. Roll each rectangle into a log starting from the longer side; cut each log into 1/2-inch thick slices. Arrange mini cinnamon rolls close to one another on the baking sheet.
5. Bake the mini cinnamon rolls in the preheated oven until golden, 10 to 13 minutes. Transfer baked rolls to a plate and set aside to cool for 1 minute.
6. Combine the confectioners' sugar, milk, and vanilla extract together in a small bowl to make a smooth icing. Pour icing over warm rolls.
