## Ingredients

- 2 (8 ounce) fillets beef tenderloin filet, 1 1/2 inch thick
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil

## Instructions

1. Rub the beef with the vegetable oil and season with freshly ground black pepper. Let the beef rest at room temperature for 1 hour.
2. Heat a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Quickly sear the meat about 5 seconds on each side, then remove from skillet. Melt and brown the butter in the skillet.
