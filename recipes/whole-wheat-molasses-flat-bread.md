## Ingredients

- 2 cups whole wheat flour
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 ¼ teaspoons baking powder
- 1 ¼ teaspoons salt
- 4 teaspoons vegetable oil
- ⅞ cup boiling water
- 3 tablespoons honey
- 3 tablespoons molasses
- 1 tablespoon butter, melted  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet. Whisk the whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl.
2. Mix vegetable oil, boiling water, honey, and molasses into the flour mixture, and stir until thoroughly combined. Turn the dough out onto a well-floured work surface, and knead a few times to be sure the dough is completely mixed. Divide the dough into quarters, and roll each quarter into a ball. Press each dough ball into a circle about 1/4-inch thick, and place on prepared baking sheet. If desired, use a kitchen knife to lightly score the breads with 2 criss-cross lines to break the breads apart later.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until browned, about 15 minutes. If desired, brush the breads with melted butter after removing from oven.
