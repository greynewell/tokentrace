## Ingredients

- ½ cup hazelnuts
- 1 cup eggnog, plus
- 1 tablespoon eggnog
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 3 tablespoons butter, softened
- 1  egg
- 1  egg yolk
- 3 cups bread flour
- 1 ½ teaspoons instant yeast
- 2 tablespoons anise seed
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ½ cup confectioners' sugar
- 1 tablespoon eggnog

## Instructions

1. Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Spread hazelnuts evenly on a baking sheet. Bake until lightly toasted, about 5 to 7 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven, transfer the nuts to a bowl, and let them cool.
3. Place the eggnog, sugar, salt, butter, egg, egg yolk, bread flour, yeast, anise seed, and cinnamon into the bread machine. Program the machine for a basic cycle with the crust as "medium." Press start. Do not use the delay timer.
4. Place the cooled toasted hazelnuts into the machine between Knead Cycle 1 and Knead Cycle 2. When the baking cycle ends, immediately remove the bread from the pan and allow it to cool on a rack.
5. Prepare the glaze by combining the confectioners' sugar and eggnog in a bowl; mix well. It should be a drizzling consistency. Drizzle the glaze on the cooled bread before slicing.
