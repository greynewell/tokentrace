## Ingredients

- 1 cup whole milk
- 6 tablespoons white sugar, divided
- 1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
- 3 large egg yolks
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 cup bread flour
- ½ cup dry potato flakes
- 1 ¼ teaspoons kosher salt
- ½ cup unsalted butter, softened, cut into pieces
- 1 medium ripe banana, mashed
- 1 cup brown sugar
- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 2 teaspoons lemon juice
- ½ teaspoon ground ginger
- ½ teaspoon kosher salt
- ¾ cup finely chopped toasted pecans
- 4 ounces cream cheese, softened
- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
- ½ cup confectioners' sugar, sifted
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- ¼ teaspoon kosher salt
- ½ cup crushed pineapple, undrained
- ¼ cup finely chopped toasted pecans

## Instructions

1. To prepare the dough, heat milk in a small saucepan over medium heat until temperature reaches 110 to 115 degrees F (43 to 46 degrees C). Pour milk into a small mixing bowl and stir in 1 tablespoon white sugar. Sprinkle yeast over milk mixture and whisk to combine; let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. Whisk in egg yolks.
2. Combine all-purpose flour, bread flour, potato flakes, salt, and remaining 5 tablespoons white sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. Add the milk mixture. Turn the mixer on at medium-low speed. Add butter pieces, one at a time, until all are fully incorporated. Increase speed to medium or medium-high and knead until dough is soft and smooth. This can take a few minutes; don't lose patience if the dough doesn't come together immediately.
3. Coat the bottom and sides of a large mixing bowl with more butter. Form the dough into a ball and place into the greased bowl, turning the dough to coat with butter from the bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
4. Punch the dough down after it's risen. Place on a lightly floured surface and let rest, 15 to 20 minutes.
5. To prepare the filling, combine banana, brown sugar, butter, flour, cinnamon, lemon juice, ginger, and salt in a medium mixing bowl; beat with an electric mixer at medium speed until well combined.
6. Roll the dough out into a 12x18-inch rectangle. Spread the filling mixture evenly over the surface of the dough using a rubber spatula. Sprinkle pecans evenly over the filling. Starting with the long side, roll the dough into a tight cylinder. Place seam-side down and cut crosswise into 12 even slices.
7. Place the rounds into a buttered 9x13-inch baking dish, crowding them so they touch. Loosely cover the pan with plastic wrap and let stand in a warm, draft-free place for 1 hour.
8. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Remove plastic wrap from the buns.
9. Bake in the center of the preheated oven, rotating pan halfway through baking, until buns are golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes before frosting.
10. To prepare frosting, combine cream cheese and butter in a medium mixing bowl; beat with an electric mixer until combined and fluffy. Beat in confectioner's sugar, vanilla, and salt. Stir in pineapple until well combined. Spread the icing over the warm cinnamon rolls. Sprinkle with pecans.
