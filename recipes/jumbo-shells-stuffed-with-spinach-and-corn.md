## Ingredients

- 1 (12 ounce) box jumbo pasta shells
- ¼ cup grapeseed oil
- 1 (10 ounce) package frozen leaf spinach, thawed and drained
- 1 (10 ounce) package frozen corn kernels, thawed and drained
- 1 tablespoon chicken bouillon granules
- 1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 3 (8 ounce) cans diced tomatoes with basil
- 1 (3 ounce) can tomato paste
- ½ cup warm water
- 1 pinch dried cilantro

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook pasta shells in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 9 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, heat grapeseed oil in a deep skillet over medium heat. Add spinach, corn, chicken bouillon, salt, and pepper. Cook until spinach and corn are tender, about 5 minutes.
3. Drain pasta shells. Fill with corn-spinach mixture. Place shells back into the same deep skillet and cover with diced tomatoes. Mix tomato paste and warm water together and pour onto shells.
4. Cover and cook on medium heat until tomatoes are heated through, about 10 minutes. Garnish with dried cilantro.
