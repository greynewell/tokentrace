## Ingredients

- 6  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- 2 cups teriyaki sauce, divided
- 6  pineapple rings
- ½ cup butter, melted
- ¾ cup packed brown sugar

## Instructions

1. Place the chicken breast halves in a dish with the 1 1/2 cups of teriyaki sauce. Cover and refrigerate 8 hours or overnight.
