## Ingredients

- 1 pound ground beef
- ⅔ cup bread crumbs
- 2  eggs, whisked
- 2 teaspoons salt, divided
- 1 ½ teaspoons ground black pepper, divided
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- 1 cup grated Cheddar cheese  (Optional)
- 3  jalapeno peppers, seeded and diced
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- aluminum foil
- 3 tablespoons barbeque sauce, or as needed
- 2 tablespoons grated Cheddar cheese, or to taste  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Mix together ground beef, bread crumbs, eggs, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper in a large bowl until combined. Press about 3/4 of the meat mixture into the bottom and up the sides of a loaf pan, leaving a well in the middle.
3. Mix together cream cheese, 1 cup Cheddar cheese, jalapeno peppers, garlic powder, remaining 1 teaspoon salt, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a separate bowl until combined. Press cream cheese mixture into the well of the meatloaf. Cover with remaining meat mixture, pressing along the edges to seal. Cover with aluminum foil.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, 30 to 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Remove from the oven, brush with barbeque sauce, and sprinkle with 2 tablespoons grated Cheddar. Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
5. Place meatloaf under the broiler and cook until barbeque sauce is bubbly and cheese is melted, 2 to 3 minutes.
