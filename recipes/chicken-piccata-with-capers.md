## Ingredients

- 4 (6 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- ½ cup white wine
- ¼ cup fresh lemon juice
- 2 tablespoons capers
- 2 teaspoons minced garlic
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley

## Instructions

1. Place each chicken breast between 2 sheets of heavy-duty plastic wrap. Pound breasts to 1/2-inch thickness using a meat mallet or small heavy skillet.
2. Spread flour into a wide, shallow dish. Press chicken into flour to coat completely.
3. Melt butter with olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook chicken in hot butter mixture until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Remove chicken from skillet to a serving platter and cover with a lid to keep warm.
4. Pour white wine, lemon juice, capers, and garlic into the pan. Bring the liquid to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food from the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon; cook at a boil until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes. Season the mixture with salt and pepper.
5. Drizzle sauce over and around the chicken; garnish with parsley.
