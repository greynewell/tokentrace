## Ingredients

- 12  empanada pastry rounds
- 5 tablespoons butter, divided
- 3  green onions, minced
- 1 (14 ounce) can sweet corn, drained
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 pinch ground nutmeg
- 6 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ cups whole milk
- 6 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese, divided

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease and flour a 12-cup muffin tin.
2. Line the muffin cups with the 12 pastry rounds.
