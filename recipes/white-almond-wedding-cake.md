## Ingredients

- 1 (18.25 ounce) package white cake mix
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 cup white sugar
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- 1 ⅓ cups water
- 1 cup sour cream
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 teaspoon almond extract
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 4  egg whites

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour an 11x13 inch cake pan.
2. Stir together the white cake mix, flour, sugar, and salt in a large bowl until well mixed. Pour in the water, sour cream, vegetable oil, almond and vanilla extracts, and egg whites, and beat with an electric mix on low until all the ingredients are mixed and moistened but some lumps still remain, 4 minutes.
