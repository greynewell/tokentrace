## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
- 1 tablespoon minced shallot
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 5 pint-sized jars with lids
- 1 (15 ounce) can cannellini beans, drained and rinsed
- 20  cherry tomatoes, halved
- 8 cups stemmed kale, cut into ribbons
- 1 pinch salt
- 5 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese

## Instructions

1. Whisk lemon juice, red wine vinegar, shallot, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl. Slowly drizzle in olive oil, whisking constantly until dressing is combined.
2. Line jars up in an assembly line fashion. Divide beans evenly between the jars. Spoon about 1 1/2 tablespoons dressing over the beans. Add 8 tomato halves to each jar.
3. Sprinkle kale with salt and lightly massage until leaves are slightly softened and starting to turn a brighter green color, 20 to 30 seconds. Divide kale between the jars, packing it down tightly to squeeze out air pockets.
4. Top each salad with 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese. Place lids on jars and refrigerate. Pour salad out into a bowl and toss when ready to eat.
