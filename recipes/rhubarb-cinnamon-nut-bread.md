## Ingredients

- 1 ⅓ cups white sugar, divided
- ½ cup finely chopped toasted pecans
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1  egg
- 1 cup milk
- ⅓ cup vegetable oil
- 1 cup chopped rhubarb

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Grease and flour the bottom and 1/2 inch up the sides of a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
3. Stir together 1/3 cup sugar, pecans, and cinnamon in a small bowl.
4. Stir together flour, baking powder, salt, and remaining 1 cup sugar in a large bowl.
5. In another bowl, beat egg with a fork; stir in milk and oil.
6. Add egg mixture to flour mixture.
7. Stir until just moistened; batter should be lumpy.
8. Fold in rhubarb.
9. Spoon 1/2 of the batter into prepared pan, then sprinkle with 1/2 of the cinnamon mixture.
10. Repeat with remaining batter and cinnamon mixture.
11. Using a table knife or thin metal spatula, cut down through batter and pull up in a circular motion to marble the cinnamon mixture.
12. Bake until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, 55 to 60 minutes.
13. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let cool 10 minutes.
14. Remove bread and let cool completely on rack, at least 30 minutes.
15. Wrap bread with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature, 8 hours to overnight, before slicing.
16. You don't have to wait overnight, but the bread is much easier to slice and has a better texture if you do.
