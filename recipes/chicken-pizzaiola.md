## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded thin
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon black pepper
- 3  potatoes, peeled and quartered
- 2  green bell peppers, cut into strips
- 2 teaspoons dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- ¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
- 3 tablespoons tomato paste
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
2. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Season chicken breasts on both sides with salt and pepper. Cook chicken in hot oil until completely browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to the prepared baking dish; cover tightly with aluminum foil.
3. Place potatoes and bell peppers in the skillet. Season with oregano, onion powder, and red pepper flakes. Cook and stir until vegetables soften, 10 to 15 minutes. Add tomatoes, tomato paste, and chicken broth to the skillet; bring to a boil. Remove from heat and pour over chicken breasts; tightly cover again with the aluminum foil.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
