## Ingredients

- 1  smoked turkey leg
- 3 links hot beef link sausage, diced
- ¼ cup finely chopped onion
- 1 tablespoon garlic salt
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon seasoned salt
- 6 cups water, or as needed
- 3 (16 ounce) packages frozen black-eyed peas
- 1 teaspoon white sugar

## Instructions

1. Place the smoked turkey leg, sausage, onion, garlic salt, black pepper, and seasoned salt into a large soup pot; pour in water to cover. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat and simmer until the meat is tender, about 1 hour.
