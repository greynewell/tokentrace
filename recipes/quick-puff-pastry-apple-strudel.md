## Ingredients

- 4  apples - peeled, cored, and chopped
- ½ cup raisins
- ¾ cup white sugar
- ½ cup chopped walnuts
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- ½ (17.5 ounce) package frozen puff pastry, thawed
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
- 1  egg, lightly beaten
- 1 tablespoon white sugar, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Combine apples, 3/4 cup sugar, raisins, walnuts, and cinnamon in a large bowl for the filling.
