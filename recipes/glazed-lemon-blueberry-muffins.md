## Ingredients

- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ cups white sugar
- 2  lemons, zested and juiced, divided
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1 cup buttermilk
- ⅔ cup vegetable oil
- 2  eggs
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 12 ounces fresh blueberries
- 2 cups confectioners' sugar
- ½ cup butter, melted
- ¼ cup hot water
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line two 12-cup muffin tins with paper liners.
2. Stir flour, sugar, 1 tablespoon lemon zest, baking soda, salt, and nutmeg together in a large bowl.
3. Whisk buttermilk, oil, eggs, lemon juice, and vanilla extract together in a medium bowl. Stir into the flour mixture until just moistened. Fold in blueberries. Spoon batter into muffin cups, filling them about 3/4 full.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer muffins onto a wire rack to cool for about 15 minutes.
5. Meanwhile, combine confectioners' sugar, butter, hot water, vanilla extract, and remaining zest in a medium bowl. Whisk to combine.
6. Dip cooled muffin tops in glaze. Cool until glaze firms up, about 10 minutes. Dip muffins a second time.
