## Ingredients

- 1 (8 ounce) round Brie cheese, rind removed
- cooking spray
- 1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed
- ½ cup cranberry sauce
- ⅓ cup finely chopped walnuts
- sea salt to taste

## Instructions

1. Remove and discard rind from Brie cheese. Place cheese in the freezer for 20 minutes to make it easier to cut.
2. Meanwhile, oil a 24-cup mini muffin pan with cooking spray.
3. Roll puff pastry sheet out into a 10x14-inch rectangle. Cut sheet lengthwise into 4 even strips and then crosswise into 6 even strips, making 24 squares. Separate squares and gently press each one into a prepared muffin cup.
4. Remove chilled Brie from the freezer; cut into 24 pieces, approximately 3/4-inch in size.
5. Add 1 teaspoon cranberry sauce to each pastry-lined muffin cup, then press in a piece of Brie and top with 1 teaspoon chopped walnuts. Season each bite with a pinch of sea salt. Transfer muffin pan to the refrigerator and chill for at least 30 minutes, or cover and chill for up to 3 days.
6. When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
7. Bake bites in the preheated oven until golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes.
