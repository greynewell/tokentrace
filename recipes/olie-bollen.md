## Ingredients

- 2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
- ½ cup lukewarm water (110 degrees F to 115 degrees F)
- 4 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2  eggs, beaten
- 1 ½ cups milk
- 1 ½ cups chopped apple
- 1 cup raisins  (Optional)
- 1 quart vegetable oil for frying
- white sugar for decoration

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to the lowest possible temperature setting.
2. Dissolve yeast in warm water in a small mixing bowl; set aside.
3. Combine flour, sugar, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Add eggs, yeast mixture, and milk; beat with an electric mixer until blended. Cover the bowl of dough with a greased piece of plastic wrap.
4. Turn off the oven. Place the bowl on the lowest rack of the warmed oven. Allow to rest and rise for 1 hour.
5. Heat oil in a heavy-bottomed, deep skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
6. Remove the bowl from the oven; mix apples and raisins into dough. Carefully slide dough by heaping teaspoons into hot oil. Do not crowd the skillet.
7. Fry fritters in hot oil until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. They should turn over on their own when they are ready to brown on the other side, but keep an eye on them and flip them as necessary. Remove them to a paper towel-lined plate and repeat with remaining dough. Dust with sugar while warm.
