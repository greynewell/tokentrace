## Ingredients

- 1 ½ tablespoons olive oil
- 3 large chicken breasts
- 1 large onion, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, crushed
- 13 cups water
- 2 cups white wine
- ¾ cup fresh lemon juice
- 1 (4 inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and thinly sliced
- 7  whole black peppercorns
- 4 cubes  chicken bouillon
- 3  bay leaves
- 1 tablespoon white sugar

## Instructions

1. Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add chicken, onion, and crushed garlic cloves; cook in hot oil until chicken breast is browned and onions start to turn translucent, about 5 minutes . Pour water, white wine, and lemon juice over the chicken mixture; stir sliced ginger, peppercorns, chicken bouillon, bay leaves, and white sugar into the liquid. Bring to a simmer, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook for 45 minutes.
2. Remove and discard the crushed garlic cloves. Remove chicken breasts from the soup to a cutting board; chop into bite-size pieces.
3. Add carrot, celery, kohlrabi, rosemary, and thyme to the soup. Reduce heat to low until the vegetables begin to soften, about 20 minutes.
4. Bring the soup to a boil. Return chopped chicken to the soup along with the egg noodles, minced garlic, and grated ginger; remove the pot from heat and let sit until the noodles have softened, about 10 minutes. Season with salt. Garnish with parsley.
