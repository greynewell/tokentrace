## Ingredients

- ¼ cup canola oil
- ¼ cup high-quality root beer
- 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
- 2 tablespoons teriyaki sauce
- 2 tablespoons steak sauce (such as Heinz 57®)
- 1 teaspoon garlic salt
- ½ teaspoon onion salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ teaspoon dried basil
- ½ teaspoon ground thyme
- ½ teaspoon dried rosemary
- 4 (6 ounce) rib-eye steaks

## Instructions

1. Stir the canola oil, root beer, Worcestershire sauce, teriyaki sauce, steak sauce, garlic salt, onion salt, black pepper, basil, thyme, and rosemary together in a bowl.
2. Pierce the steaks in several places on both sides; arrange in a single layer in a shallow non-reactive dish. Pour the marinade over the steaks, flipping the meat to coat both sides. Allow to marinate in refrigerator 3 to 4 hours, flipping meat once halfway through.
3. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.
4. Remove the steaks from the marinade and shake off excess moisture; discard the remaining marinade.
5. Cook the steaks until they are beginning to firm, and are hot and slightly pink in the center, 5 to 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C) for medium.
