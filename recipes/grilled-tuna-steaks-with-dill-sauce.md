## Ingredients

- ½ cup lemon juice
- ½ cup olive oil
- 2  1 1/4-inch-thick tuna steaks
- ¼ cup spicy brown mustard
- 1 teaspoon mustard powder
- 3 tablespoons white sugar
- 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
- ⅓ cup olive oil
- 3 tablespoons dried dill

## Instructions

1. Combine the lemon juice with 1/2 cup olive oil in a sealable plastic bag; seal and shake. Add the tuna steaks and store in refrigerator to marinate while the grill preheats.
2. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate.
3. Whisk the brown mustard, mustard powder, sugar, vinegar, and 1/3 cup olive oil together in a bowl; stir in the dill.
