## Ingredients

- 2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 ½ teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1  orange, juiced and zested
- 2 tablespoons butter, melted
- 1  egg, beaten
- 1 cup chopped walnuts
- 1 cup cranberries, quartered
- 1 ½ cups confectioners' sugar
- 3 tablespoons butter, softened
- 1 tablespoon orange juice
- 1 tablespoon milk

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a loaf pan.
2. In a large bowl, combine flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda, and sugar.
3. In a 1-cup (or larger) measuring cup combine juice and zest of the orange, butter and enough boiling water to reach 3/4 cup. Stir into flour mixture. Fold in egg, walnuts and cranberries. Pour batter into prepared pan.
