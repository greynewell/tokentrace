## Ingredients

- 1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
- ¼ cup warm water (110 degrees F (43 degrees C))
- 1 cup milk
- ¼ cup white sugar
- ¼ cup vegetable shortening
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1  egg
- 3 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour

## Instructions

1. Grease a 12-cup muffin tin and a large bowl. Set them aside.
2. Heat milk in a saucepan over medium heat just until bubbles begin to form. Stir in sugar, shortening, and salt; set aside until cooled to 110 degrees F (43 degrees C).
3. Sprinkle yeast over warm water and set aside until foamy, about 5 minutes.
4. Beat egg in a large bowl, then stir in yeast and milk mixtures until combined. Stir in 1/2 of the flour until no lumps remain, then stir in remaining flour, a little at a time, until a smooth dough forms. Place into the prepared bowl, turning once to grease the top of dough. Cover the bowl and let dough rise until doubled in size, about 2 hours.
5. Deflate dough and transfer to a well-floured work surface. Divide dough into 36 equal pieces and shape into balls. Place 3 balls into each prepared muffin cup. Cover and let rise in a warm place until dough balls double in size, about 1 hour.
6. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
7. Bake in the preheated oven until golden, 12 to 15 minutes. Serve warm.
