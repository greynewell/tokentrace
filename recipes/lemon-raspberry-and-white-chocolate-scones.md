## Ingredients

- 2 medium lemons
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon vanilla powder
- 6 tablespoons frozen unsalted butter, cubed
- ⅓ cup milk
- 2 large eggs
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- ½ cup white chocolate chips
- ¼ cup fresh raspberries
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon superfine sugar
- ½ tablespoon potato starch

## Instructions

1. Zest both lemons; juice 1/2 of a lemon. Set aside.
2. Combine 3 cups flour, sugar, baking powder, lemon zest, salt, and vanilla powder in a bowl, making sure ingredients are well mixed. Cut in frozen butter with a pastry blender until mixture is the texture of sand and you can no longer see pieces of butter. Place bowl into the freezer to keep cold.
3. Whisk milk, eggs, lemon juice, and vanilla extract together in a separate small bowl until combined. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture. Stir until the dough comes together, then add the chocolate chips and raspberries. Gently form dough into a ball. Do not overwork.
4. Combine 2 tablespoons flour, superfine sugar, and starch in a separate bowl and sift a layer onto the parchment paper.
5. Transfer the dough ball onto the parchment paper and use your hand to flatten into a 1 3/4-inch thick circle. Place baking sheet into the refrigerator for 20 minutes.
6. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
7. Cut the dough into 8 triangles and separate until they're 1 inch apart. Dust with flour, sugar, and starch mixture.
8. Bake in the preheated oven until they rise and become golden, 20 to 25 minutes.
