## Ingredients

- 1 pound chicken cutlets, pounded to 1/4-inch thickness
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 2  eggs
- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- ⅔ cup almond flour
- ⅓ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ¼ cup avocado oil
- ¼ pound shaved deli ham
- 1 cup shredded Swiss cheese

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Season chicken cutlets with salt and pepper; set aside.
2. Whisk eggs and Dijon mustard together in a shallow bowl. Combine almond flour, Parmesan cheese, and garlic powder in a separate shallow bowl. Dip chicken cutlets into egg mixture, letting excess drip off. Dredge with almond flour mixture, then set on a plate.
3. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken cutlets and cook until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip over and cook until chicken is no longer pink inside and the juices are running clear, 3 to 4 minutes more.
4. Place chicken cutlets on a baking sheet. Top with slices of ham and cover with shredded Swiss cheese.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese has melted, 4 to 5 minutes. Serve immediately.
