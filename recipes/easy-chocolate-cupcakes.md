## Ingredients

- 10 tablespoons butter
- 1 ¼ cups white sugar
- 4  eggs
- ¼ teaspoon almond extract
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- ¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¾ cup milk

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two muffin pans or line with 20 paper baking cups.
2. In a medium bowl, beat the butter and sugar with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Mix in the eggs, almond extract and vanilla.
