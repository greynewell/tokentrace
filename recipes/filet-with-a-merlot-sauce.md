## Ingredients

- 1 (750 milliliter) bottle Merlot wine
- 2 (14.5 ounce) cans low-sodium chicken broth
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can beef broth
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 6 (6 ounce) fillets beef tenderloin
- freshly ground black pepper to taste
- ¼ cup chopped shallots
- 1 tablespoon chopped garlic
- 1 teaspoon fresh thyme

## Instructions

1. In a heavy saucepan over high heat, combine wine, chicken broth, and beef broth. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until mixture is reduced to 2 cups, about an hour. (This can be prepared a day ahead — cover and refrigerate).
2. In a small bowl, mix butter and flour. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Sprinkle steaks with salt and pepper; cook in hot oil until medium-rare, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer steaks to a plate.
3. Stir shallots, garlic, and thyme into the skillet. Add 2 cups reduced wine mixture; bring to a boil, scraping up any browned bits. Whisk in butter mixture until smooth. Boil sauce until thick enough to coat a spoon, about 2 to 3 minutes.
