## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 4  shallots, thinly sliced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- ½ cup vodka
- ½ cup lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon lime juice
- ¼ cup fish sauce
- 2 tablespoons chopped sun-dried tomatoes
- 1 teaspoon fennel seeds, crushed
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
- ½ teaspoon grated orange zest
- ¾ cup whipping cream
- 1 (8 ounce) package linguine pasta
- 4 (6 ounce) red snapper fillets
- salt and pepper to taste
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- ¼ teaspoon grated orange zest

## Instructions

1. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat.
2. Stir in the shallot and garlic, and cook for 30 seconds.
3. Pour in the vodka, and simmer for 1 minute.
4. Add the lemon juice, lime juice, fish sauce, sun-dried tomatoes, fennel seeds, basil, thyme, Worcestershire sauce, 1/2 teaspoon orange zest, and cream.
5. Bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat to medium-low, and continue to simmer until the sauce has reduced by half, 10 to 15 minutes.
6. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
7. Add the linguine, and cook until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes; drain.
8. Meanwhile, season the snapper fillets with salt and pepper, then dredge in the flour.
9. Shake off the excess, and set aside.
10. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
11. Cook the snapper fillets on both sides in the hot oil until nicely browned, and no longer transparent in the center, about 4 minutes per side.
12. To serve, toss the drained linguine with half of the sauce, and divide onto 4 plates.
13. Place a snapper fillet onto each plate, and ladle on the remaining sauce.
14. Sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon orange zest to garnish.
