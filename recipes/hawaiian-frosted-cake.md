## Ingredients

- 1 (18.25 ounce) package white cake mix
- 1 cup water
- 3  eggs
- ⅓ cup vegetable oil
- 1 (3.5 ounce) package instant coconut cream pudding mix
- 1 tablespoon rum-flavored extract
- 1 (8 ounce) can crushed pineapple, undrained
- 2 tablespoons flaked coconut
- 1 (3.5 ounce) package instant coconut cream pudding mix
- ½ cup milk
- 1 (8 ounce) container extra-creamy frozen whipped topping, thawed
- ¼ cup flaked coconut
- 1 tablespoon coconut extract
- 1 teaspoon rum-flavored extract

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Spray a 9x13-inch baking pan with cooking spray, or butter the pan well and coat inside with flour to prevent sticking.
3. Beat the cake mix, water, eggs, vegetable oil, 1 package of coconut cream pudding mix, and 1 tablespoon of rum extract in a bowl with an electric mixer until smooth, about 2 minutes.
4. Gently fold in the crushed pineapple.
5. Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until the cake has risen, turned golden brown, and a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes.
7. Cool the cake to room temperature in the pan on a wire rack, about 30 minutes.
8. While the cake is baking, spread 2 tablespoons of flaked coconut onto a baking sheet, and bake in the preheated oven until lightly toasted, about 10 minutes.
9. Remove the coconut, allow to cool, and set aside.
10. To make frosting, whisk 1 package coconut cream pudding mix with milk until the mixture turns thick and creamy, about 2 minutes.
11. Gently fold in the whipped topping, 1/4 cup flaked coconut, coconut extract, and 1 teaspoon of rum extract.
12. Frost the cake, and sprinkle toasted coconut on top.
13. Keep refrigerated.
