3. Add 2 1/2 cups of the rye flour to the yeast mixture, and beat until smooth.
4. Stir in the salt.
5. Set bowl in a warm place, and cover with a cloth or towel.
6. Let rise for 30 minutes.
7. Stir in more flour 1/2 cup at a time, until the dough is stiff.

17. Turn the loaf so that the seam is on the bottom.
18. Cover the pan with plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.
