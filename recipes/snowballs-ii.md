## Ingredients

- 1 cup butter
- ½ cup confectioners' sugar
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 cup chopped pecans
- ⅓ cup confectioners' sugar for dusting, or as needed
- ¼ cup finely crushed peppermint candy canes  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place 1/2 cup powdered sugar in a bowl; set aside.
2. Beat butter, remaining 1/2 cup powdered sugar, and vanilla with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Gradually mix in flour, pecans, and salt until completely incorporated. Roll dough into walnut-sized balls and place 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until bottoms are light golden brown but tops are still pale, 12 to 15 minutes. (Try not to let cookies get too brown: it's better to undercook them than to overcook them.)
4. Remove cookies from the oven and let sit on the baking sheets briefly before removing to wire racks.
5. Roll hot cookies in the reserved powdered sugar to coat, then return to the wire racks to cool. Once cooled, roll cookies in the powdered sugar once more.
