## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon butter
- 2 teaspoons olive oil
- ⅔ cup chopped green onions
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- ½ teaspoon dried parsley
- ¼ teaspoon sea salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ¼ cup lemon juice
- ¼ cup lightly packed brown sugar
- 2 (3 ounce) fillets catfish

## Instructions

1. Melt butter with olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir green onions, garlic, parsley, salt, and pepper in the hot oil until vegetables are softened, about 2 minutes.
