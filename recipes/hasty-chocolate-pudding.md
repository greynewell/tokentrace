## Ingredients

- ½ cup white sugar
- ⅓ cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 3 tablespoons cornstarch
- 2 cups milk
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. In a microwave-safe bowl, whisk together the sugar, cocoa and cornstarch. Whisk in milk a little at a time so the mixture does not have any dry lumps.
2. Place in the microwave, and cook for 3 minutes on high. Stir, then cook at 1 minute intervals, stirring between cooking times for 2 to 4 minutes, or until shiny and thick. Stir in vanilla.
3. Place a piece of plastic wrap directly on the surface of the pudding to prevent a skin from forming, and chill in the refrigerator. Serve cold.
