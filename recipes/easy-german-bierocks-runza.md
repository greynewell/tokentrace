## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 2 pounds ground beef
- 1 small onion, chopped
- 1 head cabbage, finely chopped
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 36  frozen dinner rolls, thawed
- 2 quarts vegetable oil for deep frying

## Instructions

1. Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Stir in ground beef, and cook until crumbly and no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Stir in chopped onion, and cook until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes more. Add the chopped cabbage; cook and stir until the cabbage has softened, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, then spread the mixture onto a baking sheet to cool until cool enough to handle.
2. Once the mixture has cooled, flatten a dinner roll, and place several tablespoons of the cabbage mixture in the center. Pull the edges of the dough over the filling and pinch to seal. Repeat with remaining dough and filling.
3. Heat the oil in a deep-fryer or electric skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
4. Fry bierocks a few at a time in the preheated oil on both sides until golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes; drain on paper towels.
