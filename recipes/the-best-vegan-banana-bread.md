## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- ½ cup vegan butter, melted
- ½ cup coconut sugar
- ¼ cup brown sugar
- 2 cups mashed bananas
- ½ cup plain applesauce
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ½ cup chopped walnuts  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray.
2. Combine butter, coconut sugar, and brown sugar in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in mashed bananas and applesauce until well blended.
3. Combine flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a separate bowl. Add banana mixture, stirring just enough to moisten. Fold in walnuts. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into center of the loaf comes out clean, 60 to 65 minutes. Let bread cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack.
