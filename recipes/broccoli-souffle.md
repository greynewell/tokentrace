## Ingredients

- 1 (14 ounce) bag frozen chopped broccoli, thawed
- ¼ cup margarine
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- 1 cup milk
- 3  eggs, beaten
- ⅔ cup mayonnaise
- 3 tablespoons chopped onion
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ½ cup shredded Cheddar cheese

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add broccoli, cover, and steam until tender, 2 to 4 minutes.
