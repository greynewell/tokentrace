## Ingredients

- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup milk
- 1 ½ teaspoons lemon extract
- 3 cups white sugar
- 2 sticks butter
- ½ cup shortening (such as Crisco®)
- 5  eggs

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Grease a tube pan.
2. Sift flour and salt together into a bowl. Mix milk and lemon extract together in a separate bowl.
3. Combine sugar, butter, and shortening in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until creamy. Add eggs one at a time, beating until well combined. Mix in the flour mixture alternately with the milk mixture, beginning and ending with flour. Spread batter in the prepared pan.
