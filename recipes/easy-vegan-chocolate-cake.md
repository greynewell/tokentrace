## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 cup white sugar
- ¼ cup cocoa powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ⅓ cup cold vegan buttery spread (such as Earth Balance®)
- ½ cup soy milk
- ½ cup brewed coffee
- 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour an 8-inch round cake pan.
2. Combine flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl, whisking until smooth. Cut in buttery spread using a pastry cutter or 2 knives until it is the size of small peas and flour mixture is evenly coated.
