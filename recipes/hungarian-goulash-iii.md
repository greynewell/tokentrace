## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 1 pound beef stew meat, cut into cubes
- 1 small yellow onion, chopped
- 1 ½ cups water
- ½ cup ketchup
- 3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
- ¾ teaspoon distilled white vinegar
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 1 ½ teaspoons paprika
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon dry mustard
- 1 (16 ounce) package egg noodles

## Instructions

1. Prepare a large pot with cooking spray and place over medium heat; cook the beef stew meat in the pot until completely browned on all sides, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the onions; cook and stir until the onions begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Stir the water, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, vinegar, brown sugar, paprika, salt, and mustard into the beef and onion mixture. Place a cover on the pot, reduce heat to low, and simmer the mixture until the beef is tender, about 2 1/2 hours.
2. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil. Cook the egg noodles at a boil until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 5 minutes; drain. Serve the goulash over the noodles.
