## Ingredients

- 1 quart vegetable oil for frying
- ½ cup flour
- ½ cup cornmeal
- 1 teaspoon garlic salt
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 cup brown ale (such as Newcastle™ brown ale)
- 1 pound cod fillets, cut into pieces

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in deep-fryer to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
2. Whisk together the flour, cornmeal, garlic salt, garlic powder, and cinnamon in a large bowl.
3. Mix in beer until no dry lumps remain.
4. Dip the cod into the batter, allow some of the excess to run off, then carefully place into the deep-fryer.
