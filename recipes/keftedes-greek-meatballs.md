## Ingredients

- oil for frying
- ¼ cup fresh lemon juice
- 5  white potatoes, peeled
- 2 pounds ground beef
- 1 large onion, grated
- ¾ cup dry bread crumbs
- 1 cup chopped fresh parsley
- ⅓ cup dried mint, crushed
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- zest from 1 lemon
- 2  eggs, beaten
- 1 ½ tablespoons salt
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- lemon wedges

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
2. Place the lemon juice in a large bowl. Coarsely grate the potatoes into the lemon juice, stirring well to prevent browning.
