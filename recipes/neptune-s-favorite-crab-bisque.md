- 1 (10.75 ounce) can  condensed cream of mushroom soup
- 1 (10.75 ounce) can  cream of asparagus soup
- 2 cups milk
- 1 cup light cream
- 1 (6 ounce) can crabmeat
- 1 ¼ cups white wine

## Instructions

1. Blend both cans of soup in medium or large pot, stir in milk and cream.

4. Flake crab meat and add to soup.
5. Simmer an additional 5 minutes, then add white wine.
6. Add small amount of butter to surface (optional) and sprinkle with chervil or parsley.
7. Variations: (1) For a low-fat version, omit butter.
8. Instead of milk and cream, substitute non-fat milk. (2) Instead of canned crab, use fresh or imitation crab.
9. If using fresh crab, be sure to remove all cartilage and shell. (3) Substitute crab with lobster, clams, or mussels (shells or no shells).
10. For an exquisite "seafood bisque," combine all of the above.
11. Yum!
