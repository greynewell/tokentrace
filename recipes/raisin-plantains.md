## Ingredients

- 2 teaspoons vegetable oil, or as needed
- ½ cup chopped onion
- 3 large green plantains, peeled and grated
- ¾ cup raisins
- ½ teaspoon salt, or more to taste

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a large frying pan over medium heat; cook and stir onion in the hot oil until slightly softened, 1 to 2 minutes.
2. Add plantains; cook, stirring occasionally, until plantains are crisp and lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes.
3. The plantain has a tendency to stick together, so the more you stir the more the individual pieces will separate.
4. Fold raisins into plantain mixture and cook until raisins are plump and heated, 1 to 2 minutes.
5. Season with salt.
