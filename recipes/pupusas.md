## Ingredients

- 4 cups plain tomato sauce
- 1 cup water
- 4 bunches fresh cilantro, chopped
- 1  green bell pepper, seeded and chopped
- 1  onion, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, crushed  (Optional)
- 1 cube chicken bouillon
- salt to taste
- ½ head cabbage, shredded
- 1 large carrot, peeled and grated
- ½ cup white vinegar
- 3  scallions, minced
- 2 tablespoons dried oregano
- 1 pinch crushed red pepper flakes
- 1 (12 ounce) package bacon, or to taste
- 4  tomatoes, halved, or more to taste
- 1  green bell pepper, seeded and quartered
- 1 cup grated Monterey Jack cheese
- 2 cloves garlic, minced  (Optional)
- salt to taste
- 4 cups masa harina, or more to taste
- 2 cups water, or as needed
- ½ cup vegetable oil for frying

## Instructions

1. Combine tomato sauce, water, cilantro, green bell pepper, onion, crushed garlic, bouillon cube, and salt in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook and stir until vegetables are soft, about 20 minutes. Let salsa roja cool for 10 minutes.
2. Fill a blender halfway with the salsa roja. Cover and hold lid down with a potholder; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Pour into a bowl. Repeat with remaining salsa roja. Return to saucepan and simmer for 10 minutes more stirring occasionally. Allow to cool completely, about 1 hour, and refrigerate.
3. Place cabbage and carrots in a large bowl. Add 4 cups boiling water and let stand for 5 minutes. Drain well. Mix in vinegar, scallions, oregano, and red pepper flakes. Chill curtido until serving.
4. Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until almost fully cooked and not yet crispy, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer bacon and grease (if desired) to a food processor. Add tomatoes, quartered green bell pepper, Monterey Jack cheese, and minced garlic. Puree and season the chicharron with salt.
5. Mix masa harina and 1/2 cup water together in a bowl by hand. Add the remaining water slowly, about 2 tablespoons at a time, mixing well after each addition, until dough is moist but still firm. Cover with a wet towel.
6. Heat 1/2 cup oil a large skillet over medium-high heat.
7. Take a golf ball-sized piece of dough and roll into a ball in your hands. Make a hole in the dough ball with your thumb; put a small amount of chicharron inside the hole, close it up, and flatten the ball with your hands into a thick tortilla shape. Place pupusa in the skillet and fry until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Repeat with the remaining dough and chicharron.
8. Serve each pupusa topped with 2 tablespoons of curtido and 1 tablespoon of salsa roja.
