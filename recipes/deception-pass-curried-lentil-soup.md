## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 ½ tablespoons mild curry paste
- 1 small red onion, chopped
- 1  carrot, chopped
- 1  celery stalk, chopped
- 1 small red bell pepper, chopped
- ½ teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 2 cubes  vegetable bouillon
- ½ pound lentils
- 3 cups water, more if needed
- ¾ cup spaghetti sauce
- ½ cup chopped fresh cilantro
- 1 pinch ground black pepper to taste  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Heat olive oil and curry paste in a large pot over medium heat; cook and stir onion, carrot, celery, red bell pepper, and red pepper flakes until onion is softened and translucent, 5 to 10 minutes.
2. Break the bouillon cubes into onion mixture; add lentils and stir.
3. Pour enough water into the pot, so the water line is 1 inch above the lentil and onion mixture; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until lentils are fully cooked, about 40 minutes.
