## Ingredients

- 4 whole lobster tails
- ½ cup salted butter, melted
- 1 tablespoon seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®)
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 2 teaspoons minced fresh garlic
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper

## Instructions

1. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
2. Cut down the tops of each lobster tail to prevent them from curling up as they cook.
3. Mix butter, seafood seasoning, lemon juice, garlic, and pepper together in a bowl.
4. Place lobster tails, shell-sides down, on the preheated grill for 5 minutes. Turn over and brush with butter mixture. Continue to cook until shells are bright red and meat is opaque, 5 to 7 minutes more.
