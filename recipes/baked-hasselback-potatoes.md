## Ingredients

- 4 medium potatoes
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
- 1 pinch smoked paprika
- salt to taste
- 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese, or more to taste
- 2 teaspoons chopped fresh chives, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Place a potato between 2 wooden spoons. Slice potato crosswise at 1/8-inch intervals, cutting until you hit the spoon handles, being careful not to cut all the way through. Repeat with remaining potatoes and transfer to a baking sheet.
3. Combine olive oil, garlic, paprika, and salt in a small bowl. Brush mixture over the top and in between the slits of potatoes.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes have fanned out a bit, and are cooked through on the insides but a bit crispy on the outsides, about 45 minutes. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese over top and bake until melted, 2 to 3 minutes.
5. Garnish with additional Parmesan and chives.
