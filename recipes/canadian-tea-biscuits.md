## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ⅓ cup shortening
- ½ cup shredded Cheddar cheese
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives
- 1 cup milk, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Cut in shortening with a knife or pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir Cheddar cheese and chives into flour mixture; gradually stir in milk to form a soft dough.
3. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and with floured hands, knead until smooth, about 15 times. Roll dough out to a 1-inch thickness with a floured rolling pin. Cut biscuits with a 2 1/2-inch round cookie cutter; place onto an ungreased baking sheet. Press dough trimmings together, roll out again, and cut remaining dough into rounds.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes.
