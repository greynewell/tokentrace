## Ingredients

- 2 (10 ounce) cans refrigerated crescent dinner rolls
- ¼ pound thinly sliced boiled ham
- ¼ pound thinly sliced provolone cheese
- ¼ pound thinly sliced Swiss cheese
- ¼ pound thinly sliced Genoa salami
- ¼ pound thinly sliced pepperoni sausage
- 1 (12 ounce) jar roasted red peppers, drained, cut into thin strips

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 C).
