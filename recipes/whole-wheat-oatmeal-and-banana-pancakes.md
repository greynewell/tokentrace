## Ingredients

- 1 cup uncooked rolled oats
- 1 cup whole wheat flour
- ¾ cup all-purpose flour
- ¼ cup brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons dry milk powder
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1  egg
- 2 cups milk
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1  banana, mashed

## Instructions

1. Blend oats in a blender until the texture resembles coarse flour.
2. Transfer oats to a bowl. Add both flours, brown sugar, milk powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt; whisk until well combined.
3. Whisk together milk, egg, 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, and vanilla in a separate bowl; stir in mashed banana. Pour egg mixture into flour mixture; stir just until moistened, then let batter stand for 5 minutes.
4. Lightly oil a griddle with 1 teaspoon oil and heat over medium-high heat.
5. Working in batches, drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the hot griddle; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 minutes. Flip, and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.
