## Ingredients

- 1 cup milk
- 3  eggs
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¾ cup all-purpose flour
- 2 cups cottage cheese
- 1  egg yolk
- 1 teaspoon melted butter
- 2 teaspoons white sugar
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 tablespoons butter, or as needed
- 2 tablespoons cinnamon sugar, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Place the milk, whole eggs, salt, and flour into a blender. Blend until smooth. Refrigerate at least 20 minutes. Meanwhile, make the filling by beating together the cottage cheese, egg yolk, melted butter, sugar, lemon juice, and vanilla extract in a bowl with an electric mixer until smooth.
2. Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.
3. Melt some of the 2 tablespoons of butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Pour in about 2 tablespoons of the batter and tilt the pan to completely coat with the batter. Cook until golden on the bottom, and no longer wet on the top, about 2 minutes per crepe. Repeat with remaining batter.
4. Place 1 to 2 tablespoons of the filling near one edge of a crepe. Fold this side up towards the center, then fold the sides in. Fold the top over the filling, and place seam-side-down onto the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining crepes and filling.
5. Bake in the preheated oven 10 minutes, then sprinkle with cinnamon sugar, and continue baking until lightly golden, about 5 minutes more.
