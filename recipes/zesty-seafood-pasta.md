## Ingredients

- 2 (16 ounce) packages extra-wide egg noodles
- ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil, or as needed
- 1  onion, diced
- 1  green bell pepper, diced
- 2 stalks celery, diced
- 5 cloves garlic, diced
- ½ cup fresh parsley
- 1 ½ tablespoons chopped fresh sage
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
- 1  lemon, zested and juiced
- 2 (32 ounce) cartons seafood stock (such as Kitchen Basics®), divided
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 tablespoon dried cilantro
- ½ teaspoon dried dill weed
- sea salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 (12 ounce) package frozen peeled crawfish tails, thawed and undrained
- 2 pounds peeled and deveined small shrimp
- 3 tablespoons cornstarch
- 1 cup half-and-half
- 2 tablespoons Creole seasoning (such as Zatarain's®)

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain and transfer to a bowl.
2. Heat olive oil in a large pot over low heat; cook and stir onion, bell pepper, celery, and garlic in the hot oil until onion is lightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes.
3. Mix parsley, sage, basil, and lemon zest in a bowl; stir into onion mixture. Cook until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes.
4. Pour 1 cup seafood stock in a measuring cup and set aside; pour remaining stock and lemon juice into onion mixture. Stir in thyme, cilantro, dill, sea salt, and black pepper; cook until flavors have blended, about 5 minutes. Add crawfish to seasoned stock mixture; cook until crawfish are heated through, 3 to 4 minutes.
5. Stir shrimp into crawfish mixture; cook until shrimp are pink and cooked through, about 5 more minutes. Remove crawfish and shrimp from sauce using a slotting spoon; transfer to a bowl and cover.
6. Whisk cornstarch into reserved 1 cup seafood stock until completely dissolved; stir into sauce. Cook, stirring constantly, at a simmer until sauce has thickened, about 5 minutes.
7. Mix half-and-half and Creole seasoning into sauce until fully incorporated and warmed; add crawfish and shrimp back into sauce. Toss sauce with egg noodles.
