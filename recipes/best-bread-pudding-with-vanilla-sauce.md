## Ingredients

- 3  eggs, beaten
- 1 ½ cups white sugar
- 2 tablespoons light brown sugar
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ¼ cup butter, melted
- 3 cups whole milk
- 10 slices hearty farmhouse-style bread, toasted and cut into cubes
- 1 cup raisins
- ½ cup light brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
- 1 pinch ground cinnamon
- 1  egg
- 2 tablespoons butter, melted
- 1 ¼ cups whole milk
- 1 pinch salt
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 2-quart baking dish.
2. For bread pudding, whisk together milk, sugar, melted butter, eggs, brown sugar, and cinnamon in a mixing bowl. Gently stir in bread cubes and raisins. Lightly spoon mixture into the prepared baking dish.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until browned and set in the middle, 50 to 55 minutes; cover the dish with foil after 30 minutes to prevent excessive browning. Let pudding stand for 10 minutes before serving.
4. For vanilla sauce, whisk together milk, brown sugar, butter, egg, flour, cinnamon, and salt in a heavy saucepan until smooth. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until sauce is thickened and coats the back of a spoon, 10 to 12 minutes. Stir in vanilla extract.
5. Pour sauce over warm bread pudding or serve on the side in a bowl.
