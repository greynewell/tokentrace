## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons fresh blueberries
- 2 tablespoons blueberry preserves
- 1 tablespoon pomegranate juice
- 5 tablespoons unsalted butter
- ¾ cup white sugar
- 1  egg
- ⅓ cup milk
- 1 teaspoon almond extract
- 2 teaspoons lemon zest
- ½ teaspoon lemon juice
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ cup chopped almonds

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
2. Place 2 tablespoons blueberries in a microwaveable bowl; heat in the microwave until very soft, about 20 seconds. Stir in the preserves and pomegranate juice; set aside.
3. Cream together the butter and sugar in a small bowl using an electric hand mixer. Beat in the egg. Add the milk, almond extract, lemon zest, lemon juice, and the blueberry mixture, continuing to beat until combined.
4. Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl. Gradually add the flour mixture to the blueberry mixture, continually beating until you have a soft dough. Fold the almonds and 1 cup blueberries into the dough. Drop dough by rounded teaspoonfuls onto lined baking sheets.
