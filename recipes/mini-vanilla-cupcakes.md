## Ingredients

- Cupcakes:
- ¾ cup all-purpose flour
- ¾ teaspoon baking powder
- ⅛ teaspoon salt
- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
- ⅓ cup white sugar
- 1 large egg, at room temperature
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- ¼ cup milk, at room temperature
- Frosting:
- 1 cup powdered sugar
- ½ cup unsalted butter, softened
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 18-cup mini muffin tin or line with cupcake liners.
2. Sift flour, baking powder, and salt into a bowl.
3. Whip butter and sugar in a separate bowl with an electric mixer until fluffy. Mix in egg and vanilla extract. Add flour mixture and milk; whip until just combined. Fill the prepared muffin cups 3/4 full with batter.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 10 to 14 minutes. Cool in the tin for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely, about 20 minutes.
5. Meanwhile, whip powdered sugar, butter, and vanilla for frosting in a bowl until well combined. Frost cooled cupcakes.
