## Ingredients

- 1 (12 ounce) package frozen dinner rolls, thawed
- 1 (10 ounce) can coconut milk
- 3 tablespoons sweetened condensed milk
- ¾ cup white sugar, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Coat a 9x13 inch baking dish with cooking spray. Coat your hands with cooking spray or shortening, and roll the dough balls in your hands so that they have a light coating. Place in the prepared dish. Set aside in a warm place to rise until doubled, up to 2 hours.
2. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a small bowl, stir together the coconut milk, sweetened condensed milk and sugar. Pour this mixture over the top of the rolls as evenly as you can.
3. Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown. Let cool for a few minutes before separating and serving.
