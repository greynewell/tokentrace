## Ingredients

- ½ pound bacon
- 1 pound fresh chicken livers
- 4 tablespoons honey

## Instructions

1. Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
2. Cut bacon slices in half; wrap bacon around each chicken liver, securing with toothpicks. Place on a broiler pan.
3. Broil in the preheated oven until bacon is cooked and crisp and livers are cooked through, 12 to 16 minutes, flipping halfway through. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
4. Serve with honey in a small dipping bowl.
