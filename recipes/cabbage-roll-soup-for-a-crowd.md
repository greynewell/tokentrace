## Ingredients

- 1 pound lean ground beef
- ½ pound lean ground pork
- 2 teaspoons salt, divided
- freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 cup finely chopped onion
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- ¼ cup red wine
- 8 cups roughly chopped cabbage, core removed
- 5 cups tomato puree (passata)
- 4 cups low-sodium beef broth
- 11 ounces diced tomatoes
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- 2  bay leaves
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- ¾ teaspoon dried thyme
- ¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 2 cups water
- 1 cup long-grain rice, uncooked
- 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon light brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon Sriracha sauce, or to taste  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Heat a large pot over medium-high heat and cook ground beef and pork until browned and crumbly, about 5 minutes. Season with 1 teaspoon salt and pepper. Drain meat in a colander and set aside.
2. Heat olive oil in the same pot, add onion, and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, 1 minute more.
3. Pour in red wine and deglaze the pot, scraping off all the browned bits of the bottom. Cook until wine evaporates, 3 to 5 minutes. Mix in cabbage and cook, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes. Add browned beef, tomato puree, beef broth, diced tomatoes, Worcestershire sauce, bay leaves, oregano, 1 teaspoon salt, thyme, and red pepper flakes. Bring to a low boil, reduce heat, and simmer until cabbage is soft, about 45 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
5. Add lemon juice and brown sugar to the soup and cook for 5 minutes. Spoon 3 tablespoons of rice into the bottom of each bowl and spoon soup mixture over the rice. Add a few drops of Sriracha sauce to each bowl.
