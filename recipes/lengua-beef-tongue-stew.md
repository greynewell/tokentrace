## Ingredients

- 1 (2 pound) beef tongue
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 large onion, thinly sliced
- 1 small leek, thinly sliced
- 2 stalks celery, thinly sliced
- 2 large carrots, shredded
- 1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
- 2 (1 ounce) packets taco seasoning mix (such as Goya®)

## Instructions

1. Place beef tongue into a large pot with a tight-fitting lid and cover with water by 1 inch. Add salt and bring to a boil.

Stir in tomato paste until no lumps remain and cook for 1 minute. Add shredded meat to the pot along with reserved broth and taco seasoning; bring to a boil.
