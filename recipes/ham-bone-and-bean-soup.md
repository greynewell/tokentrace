## Ingredients

- 1 (16 ounce) package 15-bean soup mix
- 6 cups chicken stock
- 1  ham bone with some meat
- 1 cup chopped onion
- 1 cup chopped carrots
- ½ stalk celery, chopped
- 1 tablespoon chopped garlic
- 2  bay leaves
- 2 cups chopped ham
- 2 tablespoons liquid smoke flavoring
- 1 ½ tablespoons ground mustard powder
- 1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Place bean mix into a large bowl and cover with several inches of water; soak for at least 24 hours. Drain completely.
2. Bring chicken stock to a boil in a pot large enough to hold the beans and, eventually, the ham bone. Add the soaked beans; reduce heat and simmer until tender, about 1 hour.
3. Bring stock and beans back to a boil. Add ham bone, onion, carrots, celery, garlic, and bay leaves. Reduce heat to low and simmer until vegetables are soft, about 1 hour. Add chopped ham, liquid smoke, and mustard powder. Stir and let simmer until flavors blend, about 30 minutes more.
4. Remove ham bone from the soup. Season with salt and pepper.
