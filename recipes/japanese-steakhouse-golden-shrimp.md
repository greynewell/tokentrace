## Ingredients

- 2  egg yolks
- 1 ¼ cups canola oil
- 1 tablespoon seasoned rice vinegar
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon garlic powder, or more to taste
- 3  saffron threads, crushed, or to taste
- 1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 1 tablespoon butter, or to taste
- 1 splash white cooking wine

## Instructions

1. Whisk egg yolks until smooth. Slowly drizzle the oil, a few drops at time, whisking continuously, until mixture resembles a thick custard. Slowly add rice vinegar, salt, garlic powder, and saffron, mixing until well combined. Cover your golden sauce and refrigerate until flavors meld, 8 hours to overnight.
2. Place shrimp on a flat work surface. Slice each horizontally through the middle, being careful not to cut all the way through to the other side. Open the 2 sides and spread them out like an open book. Pat dry with paper towels.
3. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Arrange shrimp in a circle in the skillet, with tails touching. Spoon about 1 heaping teaspoon golden sauce over each shrimp. Add white wine; cover with a lid and steam until sauce becomes fluffy, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove shrimp carefully with a slotted spatula onto serving plates.
