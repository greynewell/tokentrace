## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups heavy whipping cream
- ¾ cup white sugar
- 1 ½  ripe avocados, peeled and pitted
- 2 (3 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
- ½ cup fresh lime juice
- 1 (8 inch) prepared graham cracker crust

## Instructions

1. Heat cream in a small saucepan until small bubbles appear around edges. Remove from heat and stir sugar into cream until it dissolves. Transfer to a medium bowl and allow to cool.
2. Combine avocado and cream cheese in a food processor and blend until smooth. Add lime juice and process until smooth; whisk into the cooled cream mixture.
3. Fill an ice cream maker with the avocado mixture, and freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions for making ice cream.
