## Ingredients

- 1 ¼ cups warm water (105 degrees F/41 degrees C)
- 2 teaspoons active dry yeast
- 2 ½ teaspoons white sugar
- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ cups bread flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 ½ cups white rice flour
- 1 cup warm water (105 degrees F/41 degrees C)
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 2 tablespoons active dry yeast
- ¼ teaspoon salt

## Instructions

1. Combine 1 1/4 cup warm water and 2 teaspoons yeast in a large bowl; stir until yeast is dissolved. Stir in 2 1/2 teaspoons sugar. Let stand until yeast forms a creamy foam, about 10 minutes.
2. Sift 1 cup all-purpose flour, 1 cup bread flour, and 1 teaspoon salt together in a separate bowl. Stir into the yeast mixture. Add remaining all-purpose and bread flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until dough pulls away from the side of the bowl.
3. Place dough on a lightly floured surface; knead until smooth, about 8 minutes. Transfer to a greased bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour.
4. Punch dough down and cut into 9 equal pieces. Press down on each piece with your palm and roll against the work surface to form into a ball.
5. Place balls of dough on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Cover with greased plastic wrap; let rise until puffy, 40 to 50 minutes.
6. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
7. Combine rice flour, 1 cup warm water, vegetable oil, 2 tablespoons sugar, 2 tablespoons yeast, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a bowl to make topping. Let rest for 5 minutes.
8. Spread topping thickly over tops and sides of the rolls.
9. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool on a wire rack.
