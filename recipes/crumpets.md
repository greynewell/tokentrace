## Ingredients

- 2 teaspoons active dry yeast
- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- 2 ¾ cups warm water, divided
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons dry milk powder
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt
- 2 tablespoons water
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- cooking spray
- Crumpet rings

## Instructions

1. Dissolve yeast and sugar in 1 cup of warm water. Let stand until foamy, about 10 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, mix flour, milk powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Make a well in the middle. Add the yeast mixture and remaining 1 3/4 cups warm water. Mix well with a wooden spoon until dough is the consistency of cake or waffle batter. Cover with plastic wrap and let stand in a warm spot until bubbly, about 1 hour.
3. Combine 2 tablespoons water and baking soda in a small bowl. Mix into the batter. Let stand for 15 minutes.
4. Heat a cast iron griddle or nonstick pan over medium heat. Lightly grease the griddle and inside of the crumpet rings with cooking spray. Arrange the rings on the griddle.
5. Fill crumpet rings 2/3 of the way with batter. Cook until tops are covered in bubbles and starting to look dry, 5 to 8 minutes. Carefully lift up crumpet rings, flip the crumpets, and cook until second side is lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Turn heat down if crumpet is overly dark or still raw in the middle.
