## Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon rubbed sage
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon pepper
- 1 clove garlic, crushed
- 1 (5 pound) boneless pork loin
- ½ cup sugar
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- ¼ cup vinegar
- ¼ cup water
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
2. In a bowl, combine sage, salt, pepper, and garlic. Rub thoroughly all over pork. Place pork in an uncovered roasting pan on the middle oven rack.
