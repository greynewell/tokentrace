## Ingredients

- 2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
- ½ cup sifted confectioners' sugar
- ¼ cup sifted cornstarch
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 2 sticks butter
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 (11.5 ounce) jar dulce de leche
- ¼ cup confectioners' sugar, or as needed for dusting

## Instructions

1. Mix flour, 1/2 cup confectioners' sugar, cornstarch, and salt together in a bowl.
2. Beat butter with an electric mixer in a separate bowl until soft and fluffy. Mix in white sugar and vanilla until well combined.
3. Add dry ingredients to wet ingredients in 3 batches, beating until just blended after each addition. Divide dough in half, roll each half into a log, and refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours.
4. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
5. Slice dough logs into forty-eight 1/4-inch-thick cookies and place onto ungreased baking sheets.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until just starting to turn golden around the edges, 8 to 10 minutes.
7. Remove from the oven and let cool for 1 minute on the baking sheet. Transfer cookies to wire racks to cool completely, 25 to 30 minutes.
8. Use a knife to generously spread dulce de leche onto 1/2 of the cooled cookies. Sandwich remaining cookies on top and place onto a serving tray.
9. Lightly dust finished cookies with remaining confectioners' sugar.
