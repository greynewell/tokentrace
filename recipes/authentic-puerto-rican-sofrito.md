## Ingredients

- 1 large green bell pepper
- 1 large red bell pepper
- 2 teaspoons olive oil
- 10  sweet chile peppers (ajicitos dulces), seeded
- 1 large yellow onion, quartered
- 1 bunch scallions, trimmed
- 2  plum tomatoes, seeded
- 25 cloves garlic, peeled and trimmed
- 2 bunches fresh cilantro, ends trimmed
- 2 bunches culantro
- ¼ cup pimento-stuffed green olives
- 5 large leaves Caribbean wild oregano (oregano brujo)
- 2 tablespoons capers
- ½ cup olive oil, or more as needed
- ¼ cup water

## Instructions

1. Set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
2. Cut green bell pepper and red bell pepper in half from top to bottom; remove stems, seeds, and ribs. Place peppers cut-side down onto the prepared baking sheet. Lightly brush with 2 teaspoons olive oil.
3. Roast under the preheated broiler until skin on peppers has blackened and blistered, 5 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a resealable plastic bag. Seal to let peppers steam as they cool, about 15 minutes. Remove skins under running water and discard. Chop flesh into large pieces.
4. Place pepper pieces, sweet chile peppers, onion, scallions, tomatoes, garlic, cilantro, culantro, olives, oregano, and capers in a blender or food processor. Blend, adding 1/2 cup olive oil and water in batches, until mixture is pureed but some chunks remain.
5. Divide blended mixture among four 16-ounce containers, filling each 3/4 of the way. Top each with 2 to 3 tablespoons olive oil to help preserve mixture. Close containers and refrigerate.
