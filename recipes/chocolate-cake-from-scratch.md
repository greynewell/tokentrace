## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- ¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder, sifted
- 2 teaspoons baking soda
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 cup milk
- 1 cup brewed coffee
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 cups white sugar
- ½ cup vegetable oil, such as (Crisco®)
- 2  eggs

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10x13-inch baking pan.
2. Combine flour, sifted cocoa, baking soda, and baking powder in a bowl. Combine milk, coffee, and vanilla extract in a 2-cup liquid measuring cup.
3. Combine sugar, vegetable oil, and eggs in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Add flour mixture in 2 batches, alternating with milk mixture, beating batter briefly after each addition. Batter will be very runny. Pour batter into the prepared cake pan.
