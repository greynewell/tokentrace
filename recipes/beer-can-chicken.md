## Ingredients

- ⅓ cup brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons chili powder
- 2 tablespoons paprika
- 2 teaspoons dry mustard
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ (12 fluid ounce) can beer
- 1 (3 pound) whole chicken

## Instructions

1. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, about 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Mix brown sugar, chili powder, paprika, dry mustard, salt, and black pepper in a small bowl. Place half-full can of beer in the center of a plate.
3. Rinse chicken under cold running water. Discard giblets and neck from chicken; drain and pat dry. Fit whole chicken over the can of beer with the legs on the bottom; keep upright. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon of seasoning mix into the top cavity of chicken. Beer may foam up when seasonings fall inside the can. Rub remaining seasoning mix over entire surface of chicken.
4. Place chicken, standing on the can, directly on the preheated grill. Close the lid and cook chicken until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 1 hour 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
5. Remove chicken from the grill and discard beer can. Cover chicken with a doubled sheet of aluminum foil, and allow to rest in a warm area for 10 minutes before slicing.
