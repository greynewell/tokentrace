## Ingredients

- 1 cup buckwheat flakes
- ½ cup packed brown sugar
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ¾ cup buckwheat flour
- ¾ cup gluten-free all-purpose baking flour
- ½ cup rice flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ¾ cup packed brown sugar
- 1 stick unsalted butter, softened
- 3  eggs
- 2 large ripe bananas, cut into chunks
- ½ cup chopped walnuts

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin or line cups with paper liners.
2. Mix together buckwheat flakes, brown sugar, butter, and vanilla extract in a bowl for the streusel topping; set aside.
3. Combine buckwheat, gluten-free, and rice flours in a bowl with baking powder.
4. Combine butter and 3/4 cup brown sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment; beat until smooth and creamy. Add bananas and mix until just combined and slightly chunky. Add flour mixture, a little at a time, until fully incorporated. Fold in walnuts.
5. Spoon about 1/4 cup of batter into each prepared muffin cup, filling each about half-way full. Top with streusel topping.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool in the tin for 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before serving.
