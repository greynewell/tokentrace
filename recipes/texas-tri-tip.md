## Ingredients

- 2 (4 pound) beef tri-tip roasts, trimmed
- 1 cup dark lager (such as Shiner® Bock)
- 1 cup lemon juice
- ½ cup olive oil
- ½ cup white sugar
- ½ cup Worcestershire sauce
- ¼ cup ground black pepper
- ¼ cup garlic salt
- ¼ cup garlic powder
- ¼ cup onion powder
- 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Place tri-tips in one or two gallon-sized zip-top bags or in a large sealed container.
2. Whisk lager, lemon juice, olive oil, sugar, Worcestershire sauce, pepper, garlic salt, garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne pepper together. Pour marinade over the tri-tips. Seal, squeezing out as much air as possible. Refrigerate, flipping once halfway, 8 hours to overnight.
3. Lightly oil the grate of an outdoor grill. Arrange coals or mesquite wood on one side of the grill and preheat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
4. Remove tri-tips from the marinade and place directly over the wood or coals. Sear for 1 to 2 minutes per side. Move tri-tips to the opposite side of the grill, cover, and grill until desired doneness is reached, about 45 minutes for medium-rare.
5. Transfer to a cutting board, wrap in foil, and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes. Unwrap and slice across the grain.
