## Ingredients

- 3 cups water
- 1 ½ cups hard red winter wheat berries
- 2 cups butternut squash cut into 1-inch cubes
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
- 3 tablespoons orange juice
- 1 tablespoon pure maple syrup
- 1 large orange, zested
- ½ cup chopped fresh parsley
- ¾ cup dried cranberries
- ¼ cup sliced almonds  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Bring water to a boil in a saucepan and add wheat berries. Reduce heat to low, cover, and let cook until soft, 45 to 50 minutes. Drain.
2. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
3. Toss squash with 1 tablespoon oil and place on a baking sheet.
