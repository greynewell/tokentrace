## Ingredients

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- ¼ cup semolina flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 ½ cups butter
- ¾ cup white sugar
- 10  eggs, separated
- ½ cup orange juice
- 2 tablespoons grated orange zest
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 2 tablespoons brandy  (Optional)
- ⅔ cup almonds, coarsely chopped
- ⅔ cup almonds, finely chopped
- ½ cup sliced almonds
- 1 tablespoon brandy  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch baking pan. Sift together the flour, semolina flour, and baking powder. Set aside.
2. Cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg yolks one at a time, beating well after each addition, until incorporated. Stir in the orange juice, orange zest, vanilla extract, and brandy.
3. Beat the egg whites in a clean, dry bowl until medium peaks form. Fold 1/3 of the beaten egg whites into the butter-sugar-egg yolk mixture until combined. Gently stir in 1/3 of the flour mixture. Continue adding the remaining egg whites alternately with the flour, folding in until just combined.
4. Stir in the coarsely chopped and finely chopped almonds. Pour batter into the prepared baking pan and sprinkle with sliced almonds.
5. Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes. Reduce the heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven and sprinkle with the tablespoon of brandy, if desired. Allow to cool completely before serving.
