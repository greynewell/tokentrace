## Ingredients

- ¼ cup butter
- ¼ cup packed brown sugar
- 1 (15 ounce) can pineapple chunks, drained
- 2 tablespoons chopped pecans  (Optional)
- 1 ½ cups biscuit baking mix (such as Bisquick®)
- ½ cup white sugar
- ½ cup milk
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1  egg

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Melt butter in a 9-inch baking pan in the preheating oven. Remove pan.
3. Sprinkle brown sugar evenly over butter in the pan.
4. Arrange pineapple chunks in a single layer over the butter and brown sugar, then sprinkle with pecans; set aside.
5. Beat biscuit baking mix, white sugar, milk, oil, vanilla, and egg together in a large bowl on low speed for 30 seconds, scraping the bowl constantly.
6. Increase mixer speed to medium and continue beating until batter is smooth, about 4 minutes more.
7. Slowly pour batter over the pineapple mixture.
8. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes.
9. Run a paring knife between the cake and the edge of the pan to loosen cake. Cover the cake pan with a plate, and invert it to flip the cake out of the pan and onto the plate. Cool at least 10 minutes before serving.
