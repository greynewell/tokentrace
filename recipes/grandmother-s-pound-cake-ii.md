## Ingredients

- 2 cups butter
- 3 cups white sugar
- 6  eggs
- 4 cups all-purpose flour
- ⅔ cup milk

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease three 8x4-inch loaf pans, then line with parchment paper.
2. Cream together sugar and butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Beat in flour alternately with milk, mixing just until incorporated. Pour batter evenly into the prepared loaf pans.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean, about 70 minutes.
4. Run a small knife around the edges of each pan. Allow cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then invert, peel off the parchment, and cool completely on wire racks.
