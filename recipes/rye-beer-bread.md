## Ingredients

- 2 cups rye flour
- 1 ½ cups room temperature beer
- 2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 2 tablespoons shortening
- 1  egg
- 3 cups bread flour

## Instructions

1. Combine rye flour, beer, and yeast in a large bowl. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Set out overnight. Do not refrigerate.
