## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into strips
- 1  egg, beaten
- 1 cup vegetable oil for frying
- ½ cup butter
- 1 cup brown sugar
- 1 cup maple syrup
- ½ cup chopped pecans
- 2 teaspoons Creole seasoning

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Grease a casserole dish.
3. Place flour in a shallow bowl and press chicken strips into the flour; tap to remove excess flour.
4. Dip floured chicken in the egg and again coat with flour.
5. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Pan-fry chicken strips until golden brown and the meat is no longer pink inside, about 5 minutes per side; drain on a paper towel-lined plate.
6. Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat and stir in brown sugar, maple syrup, pecans, and Creole seasoning. Bring the mixture to a boil and cook for 1 minute.
7. Place chicken strips into the prepared casserole dish; pour praline sauce over chicken and toss chicken to coat with sauce.
8. Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbling, 10 to 15 minutes.
