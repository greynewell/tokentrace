## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 1 (12 ounce) jar caramel topping, divided
- 1 (18.25 ounce) package spice cake mix
- 3  eggs
- ⅓ cup vegetable oil
- ⅓ cup water
- 1 cup mashed banana
- ½ teaspoon almond extract
- 1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
- 1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk
- 5  eggs
- ½ cup milk
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- 1 teaspoon almond extract

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 12-cup fluted tube pan (such as Bundt) with cooking spray. Pour 11 ounces caramel topping into the prepared pan. Spray a sheet of aluminum foil with cooking spray.
2. Beat cake mix, 3 eggs, oil, and water together in a bowl with an electric mixer on low speed for 30 seconds; increase speed to medium and beat for 2 minutes more, occasionally scraping down the sides of the bowl. Mix banana and 1/2 teaspoon almond extract into batter; pour batter into the prepared pan.
3. Beat sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, 5 eggs, milk, cream cheese, and 1 teaspoon almond extract together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth; pour over cake batter. Cover the fluted tube pan tightly with prepared aluminum foil, sprayed-side down. Set the fluted tube pan into a large baking dish and fill the baking dish with about 2 inches of water, creating a water bath.
4. Bake in the preheated oven for 2 hours. Remove the fluted tube pan from water and allow to cool for 15 minutes. Remove aluminum foil and invert cake onto a serving dish, allowing caramel topping to flow down the sides of cake.
5. Cool cake to room temperature and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight. Drizzle remaining caramel sauce over cake before serving.
