## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 4  eggs
- 2 cups white sugar
- 1 cup vegetable oil
- 1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- 1 cup butter, softened
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 4 cups confectioners' sugar
- 1 pinch ground cinnamon, for dusting

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a sheet pan, then line it with parchment paper and grease the paper.
2. Make cake: Beat eggs in a large bowl with an electric hand mixer until foamy. Add sugar, vegetable oil, and pumpkin; beat on medium speed until incorporated, about 2 minutes.
3. Mix flour, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl. Beat flour mixture into egg mixture on low speed until just combined, about 1 minute. Pour batter into the prepared pan and spread out the edges.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Cool completely.
5. While the cake layer is cooling, make frosting: beat cream cheese, butter, and vanilla together in a bowl with an electric hand mixer until creamy. Gradually mix in confectioners' sugar until smooth.
6. Spread frosting evenly over cooled cake layer and sprinkle cinnamon over top. Cut into 24 bars.
