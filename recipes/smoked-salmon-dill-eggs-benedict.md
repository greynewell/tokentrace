## Ingredients

- ¼ cup butter, softened
- 2 tablespoons fresh dill
- 1 teaspoon lemon zest
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 teaspoon white vinegar
- 1 pinch salt
- 4  eggs
- 2  English muffins, split and toasted
- 4 ounces sliced smoked salmon
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 4 small fresh dill sprigs

## Instructions

1. Stir butter, dill, lemon zest, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper in a bowl until combined. Set aside.
2. Fill a large saucepan with 2 to 3 inches of water and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, pour in vinegar and a pinch of salt. Crack an egg into a bowl then gently slip the egg into the water. Repeat with remaining eggs. Poach eggs until whites are firm and yolks have thickened but are not hard, 4 to 6 minutes. Remove eggs from water with a slotted spoon, dab on a kitchen towel to remove excess water, then transfer to a warm plate.
3. Generously spread each English muffin half with dill butter. Top with a layer of smoked salmon, then 1 poached egg. Season with cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper to taste. Garnish with a dill sprig and serve.
