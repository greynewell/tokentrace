## Ingredients

- 4  Italian turkey sausages
- 1 tablespoon sun-dried tomato oil
- 1 medium red onion, sliced
- 1 medium bell pepper (any color), sliced
- 2 tablespoons drained, finely chopped sun-dried tomatoes (packed in oil)
- 1 ½ teaspoons balsamic vinegar
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 4 (6 inch) hoagie rolls, split lengthwise

## Instructions

1. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
2. Place sausages on the preheated grill. Grill until browned and cooked through, turning occasionally, 10 to 16 minutes. Your cooking time will depend on your grill and how close the sausages are to the heat. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 165 degrees F (73 degrees C) for well done.
3. Meanwhile, heat sun-dried tomato oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add red onion, bell pepper, and sun-dried tomatoes. Saute, stirring occasionally, until veggies are tender-crisp, 3 to 4 minutes. Drizzle balsamic vinegar over the veggies, then sprinkle with basil, oregano, salt, and pepper; stir until well combined.
4. Place turkey sausages in the rolls and evenly distribute the vegetable mixture over the top.
