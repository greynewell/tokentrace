## Ingredients

- 1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ½ cup shortening, chilled

Drizzle 2 to 3 tablespoons ice water over flour. Toss mixture with a fork to moisten, adding more water a few drops at a time until the dough comes together.
2. Gently gather dough particles together into a ball. Wrap in plastic wrap, and chill for at least 30 minutes before rolling.
