## Ingredients

- 1 (3 pound) whole chicken
- ½ cup uncooked white rice
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 3  egg, beaten
- 2  lemons, juiced

## Instructions

1. Rinse chicken and remove any organs that may be inside. Place in a pot large enough for it to move around, but not too big or the broth will be watery. Add the chicken neck if that is included with your chicken.
2. Fill the pot with enough water to cover by about 1 inch. Cover and bring to a boil. When it boils, reduce heat to low and simmer for 45 minutes to 1 hour, skimming the fat from the top as it collects. The meat should pull from the bones easily.
3. Transfer the chicken to a large bowl and set aside to cool.
4. Add rice to the broth and season with salt and pepper. Simmer over low heat until rice is tender, about 20 minutes.
5. While the rice is cooking, whisk eggs and lemon juice together in a bowl. Remove chicken meat from the bones.
6. When rice is finished, turn off the heat. Whisk one ladle full of hot broth into the eggs slowly so the eggs do not curdle. Gradually whisk in more broth until the egg mixture is heated. Pour the hot egg mixture back into the pot, whisking briskly. The result should be a creamy, cloudy-looking soup. Season with salt, pepper, or lemon juice as needed.
7. Add pieces of chicken to the soup before serving or serve soup with salted chicken on the side.
