## Ingredients

- cooking spray (such as Pam®)
- 1 (8 ounce) package refrigerated crescent rolls (such as Pillsbury® Grands! Big and Flaky)
- 2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 3 tablespoons brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon, divided
- 1 (12 ounce) can cherry pie filling
- 1 (18.5 ounce) package yellow cake mix (such as Duncan Hines®)
- ¾ cup unsalted butter, cut into 1/4-inch pieces

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch glass baking dish with cooking spray.
2. Unroll crescent rolls into the prepared dish, pinching the seams together.
3. Beat cream cheese, white sugar, and vanilla extract together in a bowl; spread over crescent roll dough. Sprinkle brown sugar and 1 teaspoon cinnamon over cream cheese mixture layer.
