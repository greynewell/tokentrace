## Ingredients

- 3 pounds walleye fillets
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ½ cup dry white wine
- 1  carrot, shredded
- 1  red onion, diced
- 1 stalk celery, diced
- 4 cups panko bread crumbs
- 2 cups mayonnaise
- 1 tablespoon seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®)
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons oil for frying, or as needed
- 3 tablespoons lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill
- 1 cup mayonnaise

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Place walleye fillets in a baking dish, pour in wine, and season with salt and pepper. Bake in the preheated oven until the fish flakes easily with a fork, about 20 minutes. Allow the fish to cool and break it into large chunks. Set aside.
3. Mix carrot, red onion, celery, panko crumbs, 2 cups mayonnaise, seafood seasoning, and 1 teaspoon salt in a bowl until well blended. Add the walleye, mixing gently so the chunks of fish don't break apart. Shape the mixture into 12 patties.
4. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet or griddle over medium-high heat. Fry the patties until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes per side.
5. Whisk lemon juice and fresh dill into 1 cup mayonnaise in a bowl. Drizzle the sauce over the walleye cakes and serve.
