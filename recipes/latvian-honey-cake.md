## Ingredients

- 3  eggs
- 1 cup honey
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking soda
- 2  (16 ounce) containers sour cream
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 cup chopped walnuts

## Instructions

1. Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Mix together eggs, honey, flour, and baking soda in a large bowl. Spoon 3 to 4 tablespoons of batter onto 5 9x13-inch sheets of parchment paper. Spread the mixture as thin as possible using a wide spatula. There is enough batter for 5 thin layers.
3. Place one sheet of batter onto a baking pan and bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the baked cake layer from the baking sheet and prick with a fork to enhance filling absorbency. Repeat with the remaining 4 cake layers.
4. Stir together the sour cream and sugar in a small bowl. Place one cake layer in 9x13-inch baking dish with the parchment paper side up. Carefully remove the parchment paper from the cake layer. Spread 1/5th of the sour cream mixture on the cake layer and then sprinkle 1/5th of the walnuts on the layer. Repeat the process with the remaining 4 layers. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Trim off any ragged edges before serving.
