## Ingredients

- 2 cups fresh or frozen blueberries
- ¼ cup water
- 1 cup orange juice
- ¾ cup white sugar
- ¼ cup cold water
- 3 tablespoons cornstarch
- ½ teaspoon almond extract
- ⅛ teaspoon ground cinnamon

## Instructions

1. In a saucepan over medium heat, combine the blueberries, 1/4 cup of water, orange juice, and sugar. Stir gently, and bring to a boil.
2. In a cup or small bowl, mix together the cornstarch and 1/4 cup cold water. Gently stir the cornstarch mixture into the blueberries so as not to mash the berries. Simmer gently until thick enough to coat the back of a metal spoon, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in the almond extract and cinnamon. Thin sauce with water if it is too thick for your liking.
