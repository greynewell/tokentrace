## Ingredients

- ½ cup butter
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 cup milk
- 2 cups pitted sour cherries
- ¾ cup white sugar
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place butter in a 9x13-inch baking dish, and place in the oven to melt while the oven is preheating. Remove as soon as butter has melted, about 5 minutes.
2. Stir together 1 cup flour, 1 cup sugar, and baking powder in a medium bowl. Mix in milk until well blended, then pour the batter into the pan over the melted butter. Do not stir.
3. Rinse out the bowl from the batter, and dry. Place cherries into the bowl, and toss with remaining 3/4 cup sugar and 1 tablespoon flour. Distribute the cherry mixture evenly over the batter. Do not stir.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 50 to 60 minutes. A toothpick inserted into the cobber should come out clean.
