## Ingredients

- 1 ½ pounds ground beef (90% lean)
- ⅓ cup plain dried bread crumbs
- 1  egg, lightly beaten
- 1 teaspoon seasoned salt
- 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 cups sliced fresh mushrooms
- ¾ cup sliced onion
- ½  red bell pepper, sliced into strips
- ½  green bell pepper, sliced into strips
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ½ cup beef broth

## Instructions

1. Combine ground beef, bread crumbs, egg, seasoned salt, Worcestershire sauce, and garlic in a large bowl. Use your hands to lightly mix and combine the ingredients. Form into 4 equally sized patties and set aside.
2. Heat olive oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add mushrooms, onion, and bell peppers. Season with salt and pepper. Stir the vegetables quickly, moving around in the skillet until the onion is just beginning to soften, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the vegetables from the skillet and keep warm.
3. Place beef patties in the same skillet and cook until browned, about 3 minutes per side. Add the vegetables on top of and around the patties. Pour in beef broth. Reduce heat to medium and cook until patties reach an internal temperature of 160 degrees F (71 degrees C) when tested with an instant-read thermometer, 4 to 5 minutes more.
4. Transfer the patties to serving plates and top with the vegetables. Allow liquid in the skillet to boil and reduce to about 1/2 cup. Drizzle 2 tablespoons of the skillet sauce over each serving. Serve warm.
