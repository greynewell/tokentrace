## Ingredients

- ½ cup buttermilk
- 1 cup milk, divided
- 2 teaspoons quick-rising yeast
- 1 ½ teaspoons white sugar
- 1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- cooking spray

## Instructions

1. In a microwave-safe bowl, heat buttermilk and 1/2 cup milk to about 100 degrees F (37 degrees C). Sprinkle yeast and sugar over milk mixture, stirring once. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 10 minutes.
2. Combine flour and salt in a large bowl. Add yeast mixture and stir to combine, forming a soft dough. Cover and place in a warm place for 40 minutes or until doubled in size.
3. Combine remaining 1/2 cup milk and baking soda in a small bowl. Stir mixture into dough until incorporated. Cover and leave for 30 minutes in a warm place.
4. Heat a cast iron pan or griddle over low heat. Spray metal crumpet rings and place into middle of frying pan. Fill each ring with 1/2 cup of crumpet mixture. Cook for 4 or 5 minutes until bubbles appear and the edges are starting to set. Remove from ring and cook the top for 2 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool on a wire rack.
