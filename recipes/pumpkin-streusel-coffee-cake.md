## Ingredients

- nonstick cooking spray
- ¾ cup brown sugar
- ½ cup all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
- 4 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into small cubes
- 1 (15.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
- 3 large eggs
- 1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree (such as Libby's®)
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ½ cup coarsely chopped pecans

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch pan with cooking spray and set aside.
2. Combine brown sugar, flour, and pumpkin pie spice in a medium bowl. Add butter cubes, and use a fork or pastry blender to mix ingredients together until it resembles coarse crumbs.
3. Combine cake mix and butter in a large bowl and beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until well combined. Add eggs, one at at a time, mixing well after each addition. Add pumpkin puree and cinnamon to the bowl, and mix until well blended, about 3 minutes. Stir in pecans.
4. Pour batter into the prepared pan, spreading evenly. Sprinkle streusel topping over the batter.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Allow the cake to cool for about 5 minutes before serving.
