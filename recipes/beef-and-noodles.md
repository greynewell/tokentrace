## Ingredients

- 1 pound sirloin steak, cut into 1-inch cubes
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 large onion, sliced
- 1 cup beef stock
- 2  bay leaves
- 1 pinch dried thyme
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 cup frozen peas
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 4 cups egg noodles

## Instructions

1. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat; cook steak, working in batches, until seared and browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Transfer seared steak to a plate.
2. Melt butter in the same skillet over medium heat and sauté onion until softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Add steak to onion in the skillet; pour in beef stock and season with bay leaves, thyme, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until steak is tender, about 50 minutes. Stir peas and cornstarch into steak mixture; cook uncovered until liquid thickens, about 10 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes; drain. Serve beef mixture over noodles.
