## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 1 (15.25 ounce) package lemon cake mix, divided
- ¾ cup milk
- ½ (8 ounce) package Neufchatel cheese, softened
- ¼ cup freshly squeezed lemon juice
- 2  eggs, at room temperature
- 1 tablespoon lemon zest
- 1 cup blueberries, fresh or frozen
- 1 ½ cups powdered sugar
- 3 tablespoons lemon juice, or more as needed

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a fluted tube pan (such as Bundt®) with cooking spray.
2. Place all but 1 tablespoon cake mix in a large bowl. Add milk, Neufchatel cheese, eggs, and lemon zest and beat with an electric mixer for 3 minutes.
3. Place blueberries in a separate bowl and toss with remaining 1 tablespoon cake mix until coated. Fold into cake batter and transfer to the prepared Bundt® pan.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Set on a wire rack until completely cooled, about 30 minutes.
5. Combine powdered sugar and lemon juice for glaze in a small bowl. Mix together until desired consistency, adding more lemon juice a bit at a time, if needed.
6. Run a table knife around the edges of pan to loosen cake. Invert carefully onto a serving plate and slowly pour glaze over top.
