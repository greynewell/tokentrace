## Ingredients

- 4 cups sliced fresh strawberries
- ½ cup white sugar
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ⅓ cup shortening
- ¾ cup buttermilk
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
- 1 cup heavy whipping cream
- ¼ cup honey

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
2. Combine strawberries and sugar in a small bowl; cover and refrigerate until serving.
3. Combine flour, baking powder, salt, and baking soda in a large bowl. Cut in shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in buttermilk just until moistened. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; knead 8 to 10 times.
4. Divide dough in half. Gently pat each portion into an 8-inch circle on the 2 prepared baking sheets. Brush each with butter.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 13 to 15 minutes. Remove to wire racks to cool, 10 to 15 minutes.
6. While shortcakes cool, beat cream in a large bowl until it begins to thicken. Add honey; beat until stiff peaks form.
7. Place 1 cooled shortcake on a serving platter; layer with 1/2 of the strawberries and whipped cream. Top with remaining shortcake, strawberries, and cream. Serve immediately.
