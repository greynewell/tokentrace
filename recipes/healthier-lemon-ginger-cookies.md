## Ingredients

- 1 cup white sugar
- ½ cup canola oil
- ¼ cup molasses
- 1  egg
- 1 ¾ cups whole wheat flour
- 2 teaspoons ground ginger
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon lemon zest
- 1 cup icing sugar
- 1 tablespoon margarine
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- ½ tablespoon lemon zest
- 2 tablespoons low-fat milk, or more as needed

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Combine sugar and canola oil in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Add molasses and egg and beat until fluffy. Stir in flour, ginger, baking powder, baking soda, and 1 teaspoon lemon zest; mix until well combined. Use a small cookie scoop to measure out teaspoonfuls of dough; place 2 inches apart on an insulated baking sheet and flatten slightly with a spatula.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until edges just start to brown, 12 to 15 minutes; do not overbake.
4. Cool on the baking sheet for 1 minute before removing to a wire rack to cool, 8 to 10 minutes more.
5. Meanwhile, mix together icing sugar, margarine, lemon juice, 1/2 tablespoon lemon zest, and 2 tablespoons milk for the glaze. Mix thoroughly until desired consistency, adding more milk if needed. Drizzle glaze onto cooled cookies.
