## Ingredients

- 1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
- 1 ½ tablespoons white sugar
- ¾ cup lukewarm milk
- 3  eggs
- 1 cup melted butter
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 3 cups flour
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 ½ cups pearl sugar (such as Lars' Own®)

## Instructions

1. Sprinkle yeast and white sugar over warm milk in a small bowl. The milk should be no more than 100 degrees F (40 degrees C). Let stand for 15 minutes until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam.
2. Whisk eggs, melted butter, and vanilla into the yeast mixture until evenly blended; set aside.
3. Stir together flour and salt in a separate large bowl, and make a well in the center. Pour the egg mixture into the well, then stir in the flour mixture until a soft dough forms. Cover with a light cloth and let rise in a warm place, 80 to 95 degrees F (27 to 35 degrees C), until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes. Gently mix in the pearl sugar.
4. Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions.
5. Place a baseball-sized ball of dough on the preheated waffle iron. Cook waffles until golden and crisp, about 2 minutes. Repeat with remaining dough. Allow waffles to cool for 2 to 3 minutes before serving.
