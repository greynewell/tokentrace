## Ingredients

- 3  skinless, boneless chicken breasts
- 1 teaspoon lemon-pepper seasoning, or to taste
- 3 slices Monterey Jack cheese
- 6 spears fresh asparagus
- 9 slices bacon
- 12  wooden toothpicks

## Instructions

1. Preheat the air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) if recommended by manufacturer.
2. Pat chicken pieces dry with paper towels. Use a sharp knife slice horizontally through the middle, beginning at the thickest part, being careful not to cut all the way through to the other side. Open the 2 sides and spread them out like an open book.
3. Season both sides with lemon-pepper seasoning. Place 1 slice of cheese on each chicken breast. Cut asparagus spears in half and place 4 halves on top of the cheese. Roll the chicken up and over the cheese and asparagus, keeping the stuffing inside each roll. Wrap each chicken breast with 3 pieces of bacon, using wooden toothpicks to secure the bacon, where it overlaps.
4. Place each bacon-wrapped breast in the air fryer basket and air fry for 15 minutes. Turn and cook for 15 minutes more. Test chicken for doneness; an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should reach 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
