## Ingredients

- ⅓ cup bourbon (such as Maker's Mark®)
- ¼ cup low-sodium soy sauce
- 3 tablespoons packed brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
- ½ teaspoon dried basil
- ½ teaspoon dried rosemary
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 tablespoon clarified butter (ghee), or more as needed
- 1 ½ pounds baby bella mushrooms, sliced
- 2 small shallots, sliced, or to taste
- 1 cup heavy cream
- salt to taste

## Instructions

1. Combine bourbon, soy sauce, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, basil, rosemary, and pepper in a small bowl; whisk until blended and sugar is dissolved.
2. Heat a skillet over medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon clarified butter and 1/3 of the mushrooms; saute until nicely browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove mushrooms to a plate and repeat with remaining batches, adding more butter as needed.
3. Add shallots to the skillet and saute until tender, about 5 minutes. Return browned mushrooms to the skillet and pour in bourbon mixture. Cook over medium heat until slightly reduced, scraping the bottom as you cook, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce heat and stir in heavy cream. Simmer until blended and thickened to desired consistency, 3 to 5 minutes. Season with salt.
