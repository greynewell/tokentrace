## Ingredients

- 1 (8 pound) fully cooked bone-in ham
- ½ cup brown sugar
- 1 (6 ounce) can apple juice
- ½ cup all-purpose flour
- ½ cup milk

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
2. Place ham in a large roasting pan, cut-side down. Press brown sugar evenly onto ham. Pour apple into roasting pan and cover with a lid or aluminum foil.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until ham is heated through, about 80 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Let ham rest for 10 minutes before transferring to a serving plate. Pour remaining pan juices into a saucepan.
4. Combine flour and milk in a jar with a lid; shake until mixture is blended.
5. Bring pan juices to a boil. Slowly whisk flour mixture into the saucepan until gravy is thick, about 5 minutes.
