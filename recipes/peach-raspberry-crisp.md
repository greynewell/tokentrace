## Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon unsalted butter, or as needed
- 6 large  fresh peaches
- ¾ cup white sugar, divided
- ¾ cup packed light brown sugar, divided
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- ½ tablespoon ground cinnamon
- 1  orange, zested
- 1 (6 ounce) container fresh raspberries
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 cup oats (such as Quaker Oats®)
- 2 sticks unsalted butter, room temperature
- ¼ teaspoon salt

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter an 8x10-inch glass baking dish.
2. Bring a stockpot full of water to a rapid boil. Plunge peaches gently into the boiling water for 30 to 45 seconds. Remove with a slotted spoon and place into a bowl of ice water. Peel peaches, cut each into 8 wedges, and place in a large mixing bowl.
3. Add 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 2 tablespoons flour, cinnamon, and orange zest to the bowl with the peaches. Mix well to coat. Fold in raspberries. Let sit for 5 to 7 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, combine 1 cup flour, remaining 1/2 cup white sugar, remaining 1/2 cup brown sugar, oats, butter, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer. Mix topping until well combined into pea-sized crumbs.
5. Pour fruit mixture into the prepared baking dish. Cover fruit evenly with crumble topping. Place the baking dish on a cookie sheet.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until topping is golden brown and fruit juices are bubbling, about 1 hour.
7. Remove crisp from the oven and let cool, 45 minutes to 1 hour, before serving.
