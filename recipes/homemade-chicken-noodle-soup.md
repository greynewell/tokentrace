## Ingredients

- 4  chicken breast tenderloins, cut into bite-size pieces
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
- 2 stalks celery, finely chopped
- 2 small carrots, finely chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- 2 (14 ounce) cans chicken broth
- 2 cups medium egg noodles

## Instructions

1. Season chicken with salt and pepper.
