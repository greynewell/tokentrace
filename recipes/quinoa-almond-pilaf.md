## Ingredients

- ½ cup quinoa, rinsed and drained
- 1 cup cold water
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 1  celery rib, chopped
- 1 small onion, chopped
- 1  carrot, chopped
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 8  almonds, coarsely chopped
- 1 small tomato, seeded and chopped
- 2 tablespoons raisins
- ⅛ teaspoon salt
- ⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ⅛ teaspoon dried thyme
- ⅛ teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 pinch coarse sea salt

## Instructions

1. Combine quinoa, cold water, and salt in a saucepan; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, place a cover on the saucepan, and cook until the liquid is fully absorbed, about 15 minutes.
2. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir celery, onion, carrot, and garlic in the hot oil until the onion is translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir almonds, tomato, raisins, salt, pepper, thyme, and oregano into the vegetable mixture; cook and stir 1 minute more.
3. Fluff the quinoa with a fork and stir into the mixture in the skillet; cook and stir until evenly mixed and hot, about 30 seconds.
4. Divide between 3 plates; sprinkle the top of each portion with a scattering of a few coarse sea salt granules for a surprising crunch of salty goodness.
