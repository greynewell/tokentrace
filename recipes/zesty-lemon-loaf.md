## Ingredients

- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon ground ginger
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup butter
- 2 cups sugar
- 4  eggs
- 2 tablespoons brandy-based orange liqueur (such as Grand Marnier®)
- 3 tablespoons grated lemon zest
- 1 ¼ cups buttermilk
- ½ cup fresh lemon juice
- ¾ cup white sugar

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease 2 loaf pans.
2. Sift together the flour, baking powder, ground ginger, and salt in a bowl; set aside. Cream together the butter and 2 cups sugar in a separate large bowl; beat in the eggs. Stir in the lemon zest and orange liqueur. Add the buttermilk. Add the flour mixture while whisking gently. Pour the mixture into the prepared loaf pans.
