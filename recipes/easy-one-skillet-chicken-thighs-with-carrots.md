## Ingredients

- 6 thigh, bone and skin removeds boneless, skinless chicken thighs
- 1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 pound carrots, cut into 2-inch pieces
- ½  onion, cut in 1/2-inch thick slices
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic
- ½ cup dry white wine
- 3 tablespoons water, divided
- 2 teaspoons cornstarch
- 2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley

## Instructions

1. Blot chicken thighs with paper towels and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
2. Heat butter and olive oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat. Add chicken thighs and cook until browned, about 4 minutes per side. Remove chicken from the skillet and keep warm.
3. Add carrots, onion, and minced garlic to the same skillet, stirring to coat with pan drippings. Season with salt and pepper and cook for 2 minutes. Nestle browned chicken thighs into vegetables; pour in wine and 2 tablespoons water and cook for an additional 2 minutes.
4. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer until carrots are fork-tender and chicken juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Use a slotted spoon to transfer chicken and vegetables to a serving dish; reserve drippings in the skillet.
5. Combine cornstarch and 1 tablespoon water in a small bowl, stirring to dissolve any lumps; stir into the skillet and bring to a boil. Cook until thickened, stirring continuously, 3 to 5 minutes.
6. Pour sauce over chicken and vegetables. Sprinkle with fresh parsley to serve.
