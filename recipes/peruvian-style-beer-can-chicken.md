## Ingredients

- 1 ½ teaspoons salt
- 2 quarts water
- 1  lime, juiced
- 1 (3 pound) whole chicken
- 1 tablespoon vinegar
- 1 tablespoon ground cumin
- 1 ½ teaspoons olive oil
- 1 ½ teaspoons dried oregano
- 1 ½ teaspoons dried rosemary
- 1 ½ teaspoons paprika
- 1 ½ teaspoons garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ (12 ounce) can beer

## Instructions

1. Dissolve 1 1/2 teaspoons salt in water in a large bowl and stir in lime juice.
2. Soak chicken in the mixture for 10 minutes; rinse and pat chicken dry with paper towels.
3. Pierce the chicken all over with a fork to make many tiny holes.
4. Stir vinegar, cumin, olive oil, oregano, rosemary, paprika, garlic powder, 1 teaspoon salt, soy sauce, and black pepper in a small bowl; mix in enough beer to form a paste, about 2 tablespoons.
5. Retain remaining beer in the can.
6. Rub spice paste all over the chicken, beneath the skin, and inside cavity; refrigerate for 1 hour.
7. Preheat grill for medium heat; a grill thermometer should read 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) with the lid closed.
8. Sit the chicken upright on the partially-filled can of beer and extend drumsticks to the grill surface to form a tripod shape to hold up the chicken.
9. Grill chicken with the lid closed until the skin is brown and crisp and an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a breast, not touching bone, reads 170 degrees F (75 degrees C), about 1 1/2 hours.
10. Let the chicken rest for 5 minutes before slicing.
