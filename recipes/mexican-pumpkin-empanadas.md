## Ingredients

- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- ⅓ cup white sugar
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt
- ¼ teaspoon baking powder
- 1 cup vegetable shortening
- 1 cup warm water
- 4 cups canned pure pumpkin
- 2  eggs
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon ground ginger
- ½ teaspoon ground cloves
- 1  beaten egg

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.
2. Make dough: Whisk together flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder in a large bowl. Cut shortening into flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in warm water, 2 tablespoons at a time, just until dough starts coming together. Knead dough a few times in the bowl.
3. Transfer dough out onto a floured surface. Cut dough in quarters, then cut each quarter into thirds to make 12 equal portions. Roll each portion into a ball. Cover with a cloth and allow to rest while you make filling.
4. Make filling: Mix together pumpkin, sugar, eggs, cinnamon, salt, ginger, and cloves in a large bowl until smooth.
5. Roll each dough ball out on a floured surface into a thin, 6-inch circle. Spoon about 1/3 cup filling into the center of each dough circle. Fold dough over filling to make a half-moon-shaped pie, then crimp the edges together with a fork. Place onto the prepared baking sheets. Brush the tops with beaten egg.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until the filling is hot and crusts are shiny and browned, about 20 minutes.
