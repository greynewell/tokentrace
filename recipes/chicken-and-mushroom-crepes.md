## Ingredients

- 5 tablespoons butter, divided
- 2 tablespoons canola oil
- 3  boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into chunks
- 1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
- ⅓ cup finely chopped onion
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- 2 cups milk
- 2 cubes  chicken bouillon
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ cup sour cream
- 3 tablespoons dry sherry
- 2 teaspoons dried parsley, divided
- 1 cup milk
- ¾ cup all-purpose flour
- 1  egg
- 1 tablespoon butter, melted
- 1 ½ teaspoons white sugar
- ¼ teaspoon vanilla extract
- ¼ teaspoon baking powder

## Instructions

1. Heat 1 tablespoon butter and oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir chicken until no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate.
2. Melt remaining 1/4 cup butter in the same skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms and onion; cook and stir until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in 1/4 cup flour and cook for 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low. Add 2 cups milk, chicken bouillon cubes, salt, and pepper; cook and stir until thickened into a sauce, about 5 minutes. Stir in sour cream and sherry.
3. Scoop 1 cup sauce into a bowl; keep warm. Stir chicken and 1 teaspoon parsley into remaining sauce in the skillet. Simmer until chicken is heated through, about 5 minutes.
4. Beat 1 cup milk, 3/4 cup flour, egg, 1 tablespoon melted butter, sugar, vanilla extract, and baking powder together in a bowl to make crepe batter.
5. Grease a 7-inch skillet lightly; heat over medium heat. Pour 2 tablespoons batter into the skillet, swirling to spread evenly. Cook crepe until golden brown, about 30 seconds per side. Transfer crepe to a plate. Repeat with remaining batter, separating crepes with waxed paper and covering to keep warm.
6. Scoop 1/4 cup chicken mixture onto each crepe and roll up. Spoon reserved 1 cup sauce over filled crepes. Garnish with remaining 1 teaspoon parsley.
