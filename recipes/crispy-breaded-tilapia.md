## Ingredients

- ¾ cup panko bread crumbs
- ¼ cup chopped fresh parsley
- ¾ tablespoon salt
- 1 large egg, lightly beaten

1. Combine panko, parsley, and salt on a dinner plate. Mix egg and milk together in a bowl.
2. Dip fillets into the milk mixture and shake off excess. Lightly dredge in panko mixture.
