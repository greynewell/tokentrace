## Ingredients

- 4  skin-on, boneless chicken thighs
- 2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- ¾ teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper

## Instructions

1. Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Pat chicken thighs dry with a paper towel and brush skins with olive oil. Place chicken thighs, skin-side down, in a single layer on a plate.
3. Combine smoked paprika, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Sprinkle 1/2 of the seasoning mixture evenly over thighs. Turn thighs over and evenly sprinkle with remaining seasoning. Arrange thighs, skin-side up, in a single layer in the air fryer basket.
4. Cook in the preheated air fryer until thighs are brown and the juices run clear, about 18 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
