## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 1 pound lean ground beef
- 2 teaspoons ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 (28 ounce) can fire-roasted diced tomatoes
- 1 ½ cups beef broth
- 3 tablespoons red wine
- 3 tablespoons sweet paprika
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- 2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme
- 2 teaspoons caraway seeds
- 1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary
- 2  bay leaves
- 10 ounces cavatappi pasta
- 1 medium red bell pepper, chopped
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in the hot oil until translucent, about 5 minutes. Increase heat to medium-high. Add ground beef, black pepper, and salt; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes.
2. Pour in tomatoes, beef broth, wine, paprika, garlic, Worcestershire, thyme, caraway seeds, rosemary, and bay leaves. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until reduced to a thick, stew-like consistency, about 45 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook cavatappi in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 9 to 10 minutes.
4. Stir bell pepper and lemon juice into the beef mixture and cook for 10 minutes more. Stir in cooked pasta to coat.
