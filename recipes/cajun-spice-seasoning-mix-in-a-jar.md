## Ingredients

- ¾ cup salt
- ¼ cup ground cayenne pepper
- 2 tablespoons ground white pepper
- 2 tablespoons ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons paprika
- 2 tablespoons onion powder
- 2 tablespoons garlic powder

## Instructions

1. While holding a pint canning jar at an angle, add ingredients to create a "sand art" look.
2. The salt and cayenne may be divided into smaller portions and used to separate other spices.
3. I found it simplest to use 7 cups--one with each spice in it--and add them to my jar with a spoon, as I want to create the special look.
