## Ingredients

- ¾ cup butter, softened
- 4 ounces unsweetened chocolate, chopped
- 2 cups white sugar
- 3  eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- ½ cup butter, softened
- ¾ cup light brown sugar
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
