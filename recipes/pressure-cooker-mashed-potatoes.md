## Ingredients

- 3 cups cold water, or as needed
- 3 ½ pounds russet potatoes, peeled and sliced 3/4 inch thick
- ¼ cup butter
- ½ cup whole milk
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt
- ½ teaspoon white pepper

## Instructions

1. Bring water to a boil in a pressure cooker over high heat. When water is boiling, add potatoes. Seal lid and bring cooker up to high pressure. Reduce heat to low, maintaining high pressure, and cook for 30 minutes.
