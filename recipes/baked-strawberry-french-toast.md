## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 1 loaf day-old Italian bread
- 2 cups fresh strawberries, sliced
- 8 large eggs
- 2 cups milk
- ½ cup heavy cream
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- ½ teaspoon fresh lemon zest  (Optional)
- ¼ teaspoon almond extract
- ⅛ teaspoon salt

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease or spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
2. Slice the bread into 16 slices using a sharp knife. Save the ends to use in another dish, or discard. Arrange the bread slices in the prepared baking pan. Tuck strawberry slices between and around the bread.
3. Whisk eggs, milk, cream, sugar, lemon zest, almond extract, and salt together until well combined.
4. Pour the egg mixture over the bread slices. Press down on the top of the bread to help the egg absorb; it's okay if a little is in the bottom of the pan. Let stand for 15 to 20 minutes.
5. Bake in the center of the preheated oven until the bread is firm when gently pressed and the top is crispy and golden, 45 to 55 minutes.
