## Ingredients

- 1 quart vegetable oil for frying
- 1 (10.25 ounce) can beef gravy
- 5 medium potatoes, cut into fries
- 2 cups cheese curds

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a deep fryer or deep heavy skillet to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C).
2. While the oil is heating, begin to warm gravy.
3. Place fries into the hot oil, and cook until light brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Cook fries in batches if necessary to allow them room to move a little in the oil. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.
