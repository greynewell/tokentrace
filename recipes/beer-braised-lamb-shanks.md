## Ingredients

- 2  lamb shanks
- 1 teaspoon salt, divided, or to taste
- freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1  onion, chopped
- 2 large carrots, cut into 1-inch pieces
- 1 large stalk celery, cut into 1-inch pieces
- 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- 2 teaspoons tomato paste
- 1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle beer
- 2 sprigs rosemary
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper

## Instructions

1. Season lamb shanks with salt and pepper.
2. Heat olive oil in a deep-sided pan or pot over medium-high heat. Add lamb and cook, turning as needed, until browned, about 5 minutes. Remove from pan and reduce heat to medium.
3. Place chopped onion, carrot, celery, and garlic in the pan. Season with a large pinch of salt. Cook and stir until vegetable juices start to come out, about 2 minutes. Add tomato paste and stir to coat, about 1 minute. Pour in beer and stir in rosemary. Raise heat to high and bring sauce mixture to a simmer.
4. Toss lamb shanks in with the sauce mixture. Reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer until lamb is nearly fork-tender, flipping lamb after 1 hour, about 2 hours. Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature, at least 30 minutes. Refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.
5. Skim the fat off the top of the sauce, if desired. Cover and bring lamb to a simmer over low heat. Flip and continue simmering until meat is fork-tender and nearly falling off the bone, about 45 minutes. Place lamb shanks in a bowl to keep warm.
6. Bring sauce to a boil over high heat. Boil until reduced by half but not too thick, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and cayenne pepper. Plate the lamb shanks and spoon sauce on top.
