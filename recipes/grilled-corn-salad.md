## Ingredients

- 6 ears freshly shucked corn
- 1  green pepper, diced
- 2  Roma (plum) tomatoes, diced
- ¼ cup diced red onion
- ½ bunch fresh cilantro, chopped, or more to taste
- 2 teaspoons olive oil, or to taste
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat; lightly oil the grate.
2. Cook the corn on the preheated grill, turning occasionally, until the corn is tender and specks of black appear, about 10 minutes; set aside until just cool enough to handle. Slice the kernels off of the cob and place into a bowl.
3. Combine the warm corn kernels with the green pepper, diced tomato, onion, cilantro, and olive oil. Season with salt and pepper; toss until evenly mixed. Set aside for at least 30 minutes to allow flavors to blend before serving.
