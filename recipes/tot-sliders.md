## Ingredients

- 32  frozen potato rounds (such as Ore-Ida® Crispy Crowns®)
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 8 ounces ground beef (85% lean)
- ¼ pinch kosher salt
- ¼ teaspoon black pepper
- 4 slices American cheese
- 1 tablespoon ketchup, or to taste
- 1 tablespoon mustard, or to taste
- 16  pickled gherkins, drained
- 16  toothpicks

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
2. Toss tots with oil on a 10x15-inch baking pan, then spread into a single layer.
3. Bake in the preheated oven, turning once halfway through, until browned and crisp, 15 to 18 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, put ground beef on a sheet of waxed paper. Top with another sheet and press beef into a 4x6-inch rectangle. Remove top sheet. Sprinkle beef with salt and pepper, then cut into sixteen 1x1 1/2-inch rectangles.
5. Break each cheese slice into quarters; fold quarters over to make 16 pieces of double-layered cheese.
6. Cook beef in a large skillet over medium heat until browned on one side, about 3 minutes. Turn burgers over, top with cheese; cook, covered, until beef is no longer pink in centers and cheese has melted, about 3 minutes.
7. Top 1 tot with a cheeseburger, ketchup, mustard, pickle, and another tot; spear stack with a toothpick. Repeat with remaining ingredients.
