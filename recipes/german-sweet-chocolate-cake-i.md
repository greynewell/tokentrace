## Ingredients

- 4 (1 ounce) squares German sweet chocolate
- ½ cup water
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup butter, softened
- 2 cups white sugar
- 4  egg yolks
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 cup buttermilk
- 4  egg whites
- 12 fluid ounces evaporated milk
- 1 ½ cups white sugar
- ¾ cup butter
- 4  egg yolks
- 1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 (8 ounce) package flaked coconut
- 1 ½ cups chopped pecans

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line the bottom of 9x13-inch baking pan with parchment paper.
2. Place chocolate and water in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat in the microwave on high until mixture is melted and smooth, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, stirring once halfway. Set aside.
3. Mix together flour, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl; set aside.
4. Cream sugar and butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add egg yolks one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in melted chocolate and vanilla until combined. Add flour mixture alternately with buttermilk, beating after each addition until smooth.
5. Beat egg whites in a separate bowl with clean beaters until soft peaks form. Gently fold beaten whites into batter. Pour into the prepared baking pan.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool cake completely on a wire rack.
7. Meanwhile, make frosting: Combine milk, sugar, butter, egg yolks, and vanilla in a large saucepan. Cook and stir over medium heat until thick and golden brown, about 12 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat. Stir in coconut and pecans. Cool to room temperature; frosting will thicken as it cools.
8. Spread frosting over cooled cake.
