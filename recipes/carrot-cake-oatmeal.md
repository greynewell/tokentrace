## Ingredients

- 4 cups water
- 1 cup steel-cut oats
- 1  apple - peeled, cored, and chopped
- ½ cup shredded carrot
- ½ cup raisins
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ½ teaspoon ground ginger
- 1 pinch salt
- 1 tablespoon butter
- ¾ cup chopped pecans
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- ½ cup plain yogurt

## Instructions

1. Bring water to a boil in a heavy, large saucepan, and stir in the oats. Reduce heat to a simmer, and cook oats until they begin to thicken, about 10 minutes; mix in the apple, carrot, raisins, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and salt. Let the oats simmer until tender, about 20 more minutes.
2. While the oats are simmering, melt butter in a skillet over medium-low heat, and stir in the pecans. Toast the nuts until fragrant and lightly browned, 2 to 5 minutes, then sprinkle with brown sugar and stir until sugar has melted and coated the pecans.
3. Serve in bowls, each topped with about 2 tablespoons of the pecan mixture and a dollop of yogurt.
