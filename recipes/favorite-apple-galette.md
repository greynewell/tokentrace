## Ingredients

- 1 ⅛ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ½ cup butter, cut into pieces
- 2 tablespoons ice water, or as needed
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- ¼ cup brown sugar, or more to taste
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 5  apples - peeled, cored, and sliced
- 2 tablespoons butter, cut into pieces
- 1 tablespoon coarse sugar crystals  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Make pastry: Whisk flour, white sugar, and salt together in a bowl. Press butter pieces into flour mixture with your fingers until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
2. Make a well in the center of flour mixture. Pour water and vanilla into the well; quickly work water and vanilla into flour to create a loose dough, adding more water if dough is crumbly. You should be able to squeeze it in your hand and have it stay together but be a bit crumbly. Shape dough into a flat disc, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
3. Make filling: Stir brown sugar, flour, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Add apples and toss to coat. Let sit for flavors to blend, about 10 minutes.
4. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
5. Roll dough into a large, rough circle on a baking stone or sheet. Pour apple mixture into the center of dough, leaving a 2-inch uncovered border. Dot apples with 1 tablespoon butter.
6. Fold edges of dough up over apples, leaving an opening in the center. Dot dough with remaining 1 tablespoon butter and sprinkle coarse sugar over dough.
7. Bake in the preheated oven until crust is crisp and golden and apples are tender and caramelized, 40 to 45 minutes.
