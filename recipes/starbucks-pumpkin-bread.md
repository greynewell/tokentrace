## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon ground cloves
- ½ teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 4  eggs
- 1 cup white sugar
- ¼ cup light brown sugar
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- ¾ cup canned pumpkin

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8 1/2-x4 1/2-inch loaf pan.
2. Combine flour, baking soda, nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl; mix well and set aside.
