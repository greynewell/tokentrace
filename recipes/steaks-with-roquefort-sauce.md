## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 4 (5 ounce) beef sirloin steaks
- salt and coarsely ground black pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons brandy
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 3 ounces Roquefort cheese, crumbled
- Italian flat leaf parsley, for garnish

## Instructions

1. Melt the butter and heat the oil in a skillet over high heat. Season steaks with salt and pepper, and quickly sear on both sides. Reduce heat to medium, and continue cooking steaks 5 minutes on each side, or to desired doneness. Remove from skillet and keep warm.
2. Pour brandy into the skillet and stir to loosen browned bits from bottom. Stir in cream, and return to a boil. Cook and stir until sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Mix cheese into the sauce until melted. Pour over the steaks to serve. Garnish steaks with parsley.
