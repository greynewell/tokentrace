## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons butter
- ½ large sweet red onion, thinly sliced
- 1 tablespoon maple syrup
- 2 (5 ounce) cans tuna, drained
- 2 tablespoons creamy salad dressing (such as Miracle Whip®)
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 (12 ounce) loaf Italian olive bread
- 8 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese

## Instructions

1. Heat butter in a small frying pan over medium heat, and cook and stir onion for 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low, stir in maple syrup, and cook until onions are soft and golden, 7 to 10 minutes.
2. Set oven rack about 8 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
3. Stir together tuna and salad dressing in a bowl; season with salt and pepper. Slice bread loaf in half horizontally, then halve both pieces lengthwise, making four equal pieces. Place bread, crust-side down, on a baking sheet. Layer tuna mixture, onion, and Cheddar cheese evenly over bread pieces.
4. Broil in the preheated oven until cheese is bubbly, about 5 minutes.
