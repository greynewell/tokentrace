## Ingredients

- 1 pound chicken tenders, cut into 1.5 to 2-inch pieces
- 1 (1 ounce) package dry ranch salad dressing mix
- 2 tablespoons flour
- 1  egg, lightly beaten
- 1 cup panko bread crumbs
- 1  serving olive oil cooking spray

## Instructions

1. Place chicken in a bowl, sprinkle with ranch seasoning, and toss to combine. Let sit for 5-10 minutes.
2. Place flour in a resealable bag. Place egg in a small bowl and panko bread crumbs on a plate. Preheat air fryer to 390 degrees F (200 degrees C).
3. Place chicken into the bag and toss to coat. Lightly dip chicken into egg mixture, letting excess drip off. Roll chicken pieces in panko, pressing crumbs into the chicken.
4. Spray basket of the air fryer with oil and place chicken pieces inside, making sure not to overlap. You may have to do two batches, depending on the size of your air fryer. Lightly mist chicken with cooking spray.
5. Cook for 4 minutes. Turn chicken pieces and cook until chicken is no longer pink on the inside, about 4 more minutes. Serve immediately.
