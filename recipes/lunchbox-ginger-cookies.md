## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- ¼ cup white sugar, or as needed
- 1 cup dark brown sugar
- ½ cup canola oil
- ¼ cup dark molasses
- 1  egg
- 2 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ teaspoons baking soda
- 1 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1 teaspoon freshly grated ginger
- ½ teaspoon ground cloves
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly coat 3 cookie sheets with cooking spray. Place white sugar in a small, shallow bowl.
2. Combine brown sugar, canola oil, molasses, and egg in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until blended.
3. Stir together flour, baking soda, ground ginger, grated ginger, cloves, salt, and cayenne pepper in a second bowl. Add flour mixture to the molasses-egg mixture. Blend well; dough will be quite thick. Dough may be refrigerated or shaped at this time.
4. Roll dough into 1-inch balls and roll lightly in white sugar. Place 2 inches apart onto prepared cookie sheets.
5. Bake in the preheated oven, 1 sheet at a time, for exactly 9 minutes. Cookies will still be soft, but will become crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside as they cool.
