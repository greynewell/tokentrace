## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 tablespoon butter, melted
- 1 tablespoon finely minced onion
- 1 tablespoon white wine
- 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon dried parsley
- 1 teaspoon seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®)
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- ⅛ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 12  medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 2 (4 ounce) filet mignon steaks
- 2 teaspoons olive oil
- 1 teaspoon steak seasoning

## Instructions

1. Whisk 1 tablespoon olive oil, butter, onion, wine, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, parsley, seafood seasoning, garlic, and pepper together in a bowl; add shrimp. Toss to coat evenly. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for flavors to blend, at least 15 minutes.
2. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
3. Coat steaks with 2 teaspoons olive oil; sprinkle with steak seasoning.
4. Cook steaks on the preheated grill until they are beginning to firm and are hot and slightly pink in the center for medium doneness, 5 to 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Transfer steaks to a platter and loosely tent with a piece of aluminum foil.
5. Remove shrimp from marinade and grill until they are bright pink on the outside and the meat is opaque, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
