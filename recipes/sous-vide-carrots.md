## Ingredients

- 8 small carrots, cut into 1-inch pieces
- 2 tablespoons cold salted butter, cubed
- 1 tablespoon honey
- ½ teaspoon salt, or more to taste
- ¼ teaspoon chili powder
- 1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley leaves

## Instructions

1. Fill a large pot with water and place a sous vide immersion cooker into the water. Set temperature to 185 degrees F (85 degrees C) according to manufacturer's directions.
2. Scrub carrots under cold water and dry thoroughly. Place carrots in a single layer inside a large vacuum bag, along with cubed butter, honey, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and chili powder. Seal the bag using a vacuum sealer, stopping the sealer early, if necessary, so liquid doesn't escape from the bag.
3. Place bag into the water and set timer for 60 minutes. If any air remains in the bag, you will need to weigh the bag down with a heavy object to ensure it is fully submerged at all times.
4. Preheat oven broiler and set rack 4 inches from heat source.
5. When sous vide timer is up, cut the bag open and transfer carrots to an oven-safe dish, along with 3 tablespoons of liquid from the bag.
6. Set under the broiler for 2 minutes. Toss carrots and broil for 1 more minute. Remove from the oven and transfer to a serving dish, spooning any remaining juices over top of the carrots. Top with parsley and additional salt, if desired.
