## Ingredients

- 1 (8 ounce) package farfalle (bow-tie) pasta
- 2 teaspoons olive oil
- 1 teaspoon butter
- 1 (6 ounce) package sliced white mushrooms
- ¼ cup French-fried onions
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- ½ (8 ounce) package cream cheese, cubed
- ⅓ cup white wine
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 1  beef bouillon cube
- ½ teaspoon dried parsley
- ½ teaspoon seasoned salt
- ¼ teaspoon smoked paprika
- ¾ pound cooked steak, thinly sliced
- ¼ cup milk, or as needed
- freshly ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the bow-tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain and transfer to a serving bowl.
2. Heat olive oil and butter together in a large frying pan; cook and stir mushrooms, onions, and garlic in the oil-butter mixture until mushrooms are tender, 5 to 10 minutes.
3. Stir cream cheese, white wine, tomato paste, lemon juice, cornstarch, beef bouillon, parsley, seasoned salt, and paprika together in a bowl; add steak. Pour cream cheese mixture into frying pan with mushroom mixture; cook and gently stir mixture over low heat just until sauce is warmed and smooth, 5 to 10 minutes. Add enough milk to reach desired consistency.
4. Pour sauce over pasta and toss to coat. Season with black pepper.
