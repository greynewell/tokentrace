## Ingredients

- 2  eggs
- 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
- 1 teaspoon dried parsley
- 1 pinch garlic powder
- 1 pinch onion powder
- 1 pinch salt
- 1 pinch black pepper
- 1 (17.5 ounce) package frozen puff pastry
- 2 teaspoons water
- 2 tablespoons sesame seeds

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.
2. Beat 1 egg in a medium bowl, and mix in the cheese. Season with parsley, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper.
3. On a lightly floured surface, cut each sheet of puff pastry into 6 equal squares to give 12 squares in total. Beat the remaining egg with water in small bowl. Brush edges of each square lightly with egg wash. Place a heaping tablespoon of the cheese mixture in the center of each square. Fold pastry over the filling, and seal edges with a fork. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet, brush with remaining egg wash and sprinkle with sesame seeds.
4. Bake in the preheated oven 30 minutes, or until golden brown. Serve immediately.
