## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 1 cup sweet sorghum flour
- 1 cup brown rice flour
- 1 cup potato starch
- ¾ cup tapioca starch
- 2 ¼ teaspoons baking powder
- 2 teaspoons xanthan gum
- ¾ teaspoon baking soda
- ¾ teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 ¾ cups buttermilk
- 1 ½ cups white sugar
- ½ cup canola oil

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a 9-inch springform pan with cooking spray.
2. Whisk together 1 cup sorghum flour, brown rice flour, potato starch, tapioca starch, baking powder, xanthan gum, baking soda, and kosher salt in a large bowl; make a well in the center.
