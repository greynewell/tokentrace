## Ingredients

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 cup water
- 1  egg
- 2 tablespoons butter, melted
- 1 pinch salt
- 1 tablespoon caraway seeds

## Instructions

1. Heat a non-stick crepe pan over medium-high heat.
2. Whisk flour and water together in a bowl. Add egg and mix well. Whisk butter, salt, and caraway seeds into flour mixture to form a smooth batter.
3. Pour about 1/4 cup batter into heated pan. Tilt the pan around so the batter forms a nice round shape. Cook until bubbles form throughout the batter, 2 to 4 minutes. Flip the crepe by using spatula to loosen it from the pan. Flick your wrist upwards to give the crepe a toss, flipping it, and landing it back in the pan. Cook the second side until lightly browned, about 30 seconds. Repeat with remaining batter.
