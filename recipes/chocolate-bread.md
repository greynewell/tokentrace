## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon sunflower seed oil
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1 ¾ cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
- 1 (.25 ounce) package instant yeast
- 6 cups bread flour
- 4 ½ tablespoons white sugar
- ¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder

## Instructions

1. Combine flour, warm water, cocoa powder, sugar, sunflower oil, salt, and yeast in a large bowl. Stir everything with a wooden spoon until a soft dough forms.
2. Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes.
3. Divide dough in half. Roll each half into a ball and place on a baking sheet. Cut crisscross designs in the top of each ball, then cover with a kitchen towel. Let rise until double in size, about 1 hour.
4. When dough has almost finished rising, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
5. Remove the kitchen towel, and bake dough in the preheated oven for 35 minutes.
6. Remove from the oven and transfer to a wire rack to cool.
