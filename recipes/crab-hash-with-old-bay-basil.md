## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons vegetable or olive oil
- 1 large onion, cut into 1/2-inch dice
- 1 (16 ounce) can crab (preferably claw), picked over
- 1 ½ pounds starchy potatoes (such as Idaho), cut into 1/2-inch dice
- 2 tablespoons vegetable or olive oil
- 2 tablespoons ketchup
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- ½ teaspoon Old Bay (tm) Seasoning
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil (or parsley)
- 2 tablespoons water
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper

## Instructions

1. Heat 2 tablespoons oil over low heat in a 12-inch non-stick skillet (so potatoes don't stick).
2. While skillet heats, prepare onion and crab as directed above.
3. A few minutes before cooking, increase heat to medium-high.
4. When oil starts to send up wisps of smoke, add onion and crab; cook, stirring often, until golden brown, 4 to 6 minutes.
5. Meanwhile, dice potatoes and toss with remaining oil.
6. Transfer crab mixture to a bowl and reserve.
7. Add potatoes to empty skillet; cook, stirring only occasionally so they form a golden-brown crust, about 10 minutes.
8. As potatoes cook, mix ketchup, mustard,  ™ Seasoning, fresh basil and 2 tablespoons of water. (Recipe can be prepared to this point up to 2 hours ahead.
9. Spread hot potatoes on a large lipped cookie sheet; cover when cool.
10. Return skillet to medium-high; add potatoes and re-crisp.) Return reserved crab mixture to skillet; stir in ketchup mixture, then season with salt and pepper.
11. Cook, stirring frequently, until hash has nicely browned, about 5 minutes longer.
