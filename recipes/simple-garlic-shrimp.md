## Ingredients

- 1 ½ tablespoons olive oil
- 1 pound shrimp, peeled and deveined
- salt to taste
- 6 cloves garlic, finely minced
- ¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 3 tablespoons lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon caper brine
- 1 ½ teaspoons cold butter
- ⅓ cup chopped Italian flat leaf parsley, divided
- 1 ½ tablespoons cold butter
- water, as needed

## Instructions

1. Heat olive oil in a heavy skillet over high heat until it just begins to smoke. Place shrimp in an even layer on the bottom of the pan and cook for 1 minute without stirring.
2. Season shrimp with salt; cook and stir until shrimp begin to turn pink, about 1 minute.
3. Stir in garlic and red pepper flakes; cook and stir 1 minute.
4. Stir in lemon juice, caper brine, 1 piece butter, and 1/2 of the parsley. Cook until butter has melted, about 1 minute.
5. Reduce heat to low and stir in remaining 3 pieces butter. Cook and stir until butter has melted, sauce is thick, and shrimp are pink and opaque, 2 to 3 minutes.
6. Remove shrimp with a slotted spoon and transfer to a bowl; continue to cook butter sauce, adding water 1 teaspoon at a time if too thick, about 2 minutes. Season with salt.
7. Serve shrimp topped with the pan sauce and remaining parsley.
