## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 6 tablespoons white sugar
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground cardamom
- ¼ teaspoon baking soda
- 1 pinch ground nutmeg
- 1 stick unsalted butter, frozen
- ½ cup heavy cream
- 1  egg
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 cup peeled and diced fresh peaches
- 2 tablespoons turbinado sugar

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone mat or parchment paper.
2. Mix flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, cardamom, baking soda, and nutmeg together in a large bowl.
3. Grate in 1/3 of the butter using the large holes of a box grater. Toss lightly with your fingertips until coated with flour. Repeat twice more with remaining butter.
4. Whisk cream, egg, and vanilla extract together in a small bowl with a fork. Pour over the flour-butter mixture. Mix with a fork just until large clumps of dough form. Gently fold in peach.
5. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Bring together and gently pat into a 9-inch-long rectangle about 1 inch thick. Sprinkle turbinado sugar on top; press gently to adhere. Cut into 8 triangles with a bench knife or sharp knife. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until golden, about 18 minutes. Place baking sheet on a wire rack and let cool.
