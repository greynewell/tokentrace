## Ingredients

- 1 cup sugar
- ¼ cup lemon juice
- 4 cups peeled, cored and chopped apple
- 4 cups peeled, cored and chopped pears

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 150 degrees F (65 degrees C). Cover a baking sheet with a layer of plastic wrap or parchment paper.
2. In the container of a blender, combine the sugar, lemon juice, apple and pear. Cover and puree until smooth. Spread evenly on the prepared pan. Place the pan on the top rack of the oven.
