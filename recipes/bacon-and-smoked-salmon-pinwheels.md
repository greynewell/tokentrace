## Ingredients

- 4 slices bacon
- 2 ounces mayonnaise
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 3  fresh chives, chopped, or more to taste
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Chop.
