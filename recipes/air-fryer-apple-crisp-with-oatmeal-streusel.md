## Ingredients

- 2 ½ cups peeled, cored, and diced apples
- ¼ cup brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon salted butter, melted
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ⅛ teaspoon salt
- cooking spray
- ¼ cup quick-cooking oats
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- ¼ cup brown sugar
- ¼ cup salted butter, cubed
- ¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ⅛ teaspoon salt

## Instructions

1. Preheat an air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Combine apples, brown sugar, butter, vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt in a bowl. Toss and stir until apples are coated.
3. Spray 4 individual-sized ramekins with nonstick cooking spray. Divide apple mixture evenly among all 4 ramekins. Cover with foil and air fry until apples are tender, about 20 minutes.
