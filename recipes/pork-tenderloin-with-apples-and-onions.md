## Ingredients

- 2 (1 1/2 pound) pork tenderloins
- 2 teaspoons vegetable oil, divided
- 1 teaspoon sea salt
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided, or more as needed
- 3  Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored, and sliced into eighths
- 2 medium sweet onions, sliced vertically
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- 1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves, divided
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste
- 1 cup chicken stock
- 1 tablespoon butter

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Trim all silver skin from tenderloins; pat dry using paper towels. Rub 1 teaspoon vegetable oil over the surface of each tenderloin and rub with sea salt.
3. Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a large, oven-proof skillet over medium heat until it shimmers, about 1 minute. Place tenderloins into the skillet and cook, rotating to brown all sides, about 10 minutes. Transfer pork to a large plate.
4. Add remaining tablespoon oil to any drippings in the skillet. Cook apples and onions in the hot oil, stirring occasionally, until onions begin to turn translucent, about 5 minutes, adding a bit more oil if skillet gets dry.
5. Meanwhile, spread Dijon mustard evenly over browned tenderloins using a pastry brush. Sprinkle 2 teaspoons thyme leaves over pork. Sprinkle remaining thyme over apple mixture and add black pepper; stir gently to combine. Nestle tenderloins into the skillet with apple mixture.
6. Roast, uncovered, in the preheated oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the tenderloins reads at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), about 15 minutes.
7. Remove skillet from the oven and place pork onto a plate. Cover with aluminum foil and let rest.
8. Meanwhile, pour chicken stock into a saucepan and cook over medium-high heat until reduced by 1/2, 8 to 10 minutes. Add to the skillet containing apple mixture.
9. Heat over medium-high heat until boiling, about 5 minutes; stir in butter until melted. Slice pork and serve over apple mixture.
