## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 3 large yellow onions, thinly sliced
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 pound ground beef
- 1 teaspoon garlic salt
- ¼ teaspoon black pepper
- 4 slices Swiss cheese
- 8 slices rye bread
- 8 teaspoons butter

## Instructions

1. Heat butter and oil in a Dutch oven. Add onions, season with salt and pepper, cook, stirring continually, for 3 minutes. Cover with a lid and allow onions to caramelize, stirring occasionally to prevent burning, about 20 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, combine ground beef, garlic salt, and pepper in a bowl and mix thoroughly. Shape ground beef into 4 rectangular patties.
3. Cook patties in a skillet over medium-high heat, flipping once, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Add a slice of Swiss cheese to each patty and top each with an equal amount of caramelized onions.
4. Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
5. Spread 1 teaspoon butter over each slice of bread. Broil until lightly golden and toasted. Assemble patty melts and serve immediately.
