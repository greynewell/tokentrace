## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
- 2 pounds raw shrimp (16-20 per pound)
- 3 cloves garlic
- kosher salt to taste
- ¼ teaspoon dried oregano leaves
- ¼ teaspoon dried thyme leaves
- ⅓ cup chopped fresh Italian parsley, divided
- ⅓ cup olive oil
- 1 cup plain dry bread crumbs
- 1 pinch kosher salt
- ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
- ½ cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). Line a sheet pan with aluminum foil. Brush with 1 tablespoon olive oil.
2. Carefully remove shells and legs of prawns; leave the tail attached. To butterfly the prawns, cut a slit with a small sharp knife lengthwise down the belly side of shrimp, almost to the skin on the back. Open out like a book.
3. Place chopped garlic, large pinch kosher salt, oregano, and thyme in a mortar; pound and stir with a pestle a few seconds. Add 1 tablespoon fresh parsley. Pound and stir mixture until it turns into a paste, 1 or 2 minutes. Add 1/3 cup olive oil; mix about 1 minute to infuse olive oil with herbs and garlic.
4. Place bread crumbs in a mixing bowl. Transfer herb-garlic mixture to breadcrumbs. Add a pinch of salt, black pepper, pinch cayenne, remaining chopped parsley, and grated cheese. Mix with a fork to distribute ingredients evenly. Pinch a bit of the mixture; if it feels a bit dry and doesn't stick to your finger, drizzle in a bit more olive oil. Stir until mixture reaches desired consistency. 2 to 3 minutes.
5. Lightly but thoroughly coat cut side of prawns with crumb mixture; place on prepared baking sheet.
6. Bake in preheated oven until cooked through and tails curl up, 8 to 10 minutes.
