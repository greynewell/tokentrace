## Ingredients

- 1 (5 pound) bone-in beef prime rib roast
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 2 teaspoons Montreal-style steak seasoning (such as McCormick®)
- 1 teaspoon chopped garlic
- 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
- 1 teaspoon mustard powder

## Instructions

1. Place roast, bone side down, in a roasting pan.
2. Mix olive oil, steak seasoning, garlic, Italian seasoning, and mustard powder together in a small bowl; spread over the roast. Allow roast to come to room temperature, about 45 minutes.
3. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
4. Bake roast in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Insert a meat thermometer in the thickest part of the roast away from the bone.

Continue to cook in the oven to your desired degree of doneness, or an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (65 degrees C) for medium, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Remove from the oven, cover with a doubled sheet of aluminum foil, and allow to rest in a warm area 10 to 15 minutes before slicing.
