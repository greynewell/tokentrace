## Ingredients

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ teaspoons culinary-grade lavender buds, roughly chopped
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¾ cup white sugar
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature, cubed
- 1 large egg, slightly beaten
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon lemon zest
- ½ cup buttermilk
- 1 cup loosely packed confectioners' sugar
- 5 teaspoons lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon lemon zest
- 1 tablespoon culinary-grade lavender buds, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 12-cup cupcake tin with cupcake liners.
2. Whisk flour, chopped lavender, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Set aside.
3. Beat sugar and butter together in a bowl using an electric mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in egg, lemon juice, and lemon zest.
4. Beat 1/3 cup of flour mixture into lemon mixture until just combined. Beat in 1/4 cup buttermilk, followed by another 1/3 cup flour mixture; add remaining buttermilk and flour mixture and stir to combine.
5. Spoon batter into the cupcake liners, filling each 2/3 full.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean, 16 to 18 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes before transferring cupcakes to a wire rack to cool completely.
7. Stir confectioners' sugar and lemon juice together in a bowl until smooth. Stir in lemon zest. Drizzle over cooled cupcakes and garnish with lavender.
