## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- 2 tablespoons maple syrup
- 1 tablespoon snipped fresh thyme
- ¾ teaspoon salt, divided
- ¾ teaspoon ground black pepper, divided
- 1 pound sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch wedges
- 1 pound Brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved
- 4  bone-in chicken thighs
- ¼ cup chopped toasted pecans
- ¼ cup chopped dried cranberries

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a 10x15-inch baking pan with foil.
2. Whisk together maple syrup, thyme, 1 teaspoon olive oil, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a small bowl. Set aside.
3. Toss together sweet potatoes, Brussels sprouts, 2 teaspoons olive oil, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a large bowl. Set aside.
4. Brush chicken with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil; sprinkle with remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Arrange chicken, skin-side down, in the center of the prepared pan. Arrange sweet potato mixture around chicken.
5. Roast in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Turn chicken over; brush chicken, sweet potatoes, and Brussels sprouts with maple syrup mixture.
6. Continue to roast until sweet potatoes are tender and chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of chicken near the bone should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
7. Sprinkle with pecans and cranberries to serve.
