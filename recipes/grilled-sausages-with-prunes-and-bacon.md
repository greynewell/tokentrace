## Ingredients

- 6  fresh bratwurst sausages
- 18  pitted prunes
- 6 slices bacon
- 12  toothpicks
- 6  bratwurst buns

## Instructions

1. Prick the casing of each sausage in a few places to prevent them from bursting. Place the sausages in a pot, cover with water, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium; simmer 8 minutes. Remove from pot and let cool.
2. Place toothpicks in a small bowl of water and soak 10 minutes to prevent burning on the grill.
3. Slice sausages halfway through on the long side. Stuff 3 prunes into the opening. Wrap a bacon slice around the sausage in a spiral and secure with two toothpicks. Repeat with all 6 sausages.
4. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat.
5. Place sausages onto preheated grill and cook, turning once, until desired doneness, or until bacon is browned. Serve on buns topped with desired condiments.
