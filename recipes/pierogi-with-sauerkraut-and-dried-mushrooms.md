## Ingredients

- 1 cup water to cover
- ¼ cup dried mushrooms
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1  onion, chopped
- 2 cups sauerkraut - drained, rinsed, and finely chopped
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1  egg
- 1 cup lukewarm water
- 3 tablespoons melted butter

## Instructions

1. Combine 1 cup water and dried mushrooms in a saucepan over low heat, bring to a simmer, and cook until tender, about 10 minutes.
2. Drain mushrooms, reserving cooking water.
3. Chop mushrooms.
4. Heat olive oil in a separate saucepan over medium heat and cook onion until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.
5. Add mushrooms and sauerkraut and mix well; season with salt and pepper.
6. Pour in the cooking water, cover, and simmer until water has evaporated and sauerkraut is soft, 15 to 20 minutes.
7. Place flour in a large bowl and make a well in the center.
8. Crack egg into the well and add enough warm water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until a dough forms, stirring constantly with your hands.
9. Knead well, continuing to add more water as needed.
10. Knead until dough is soft and smooth.
11. Dust a work surface with flour.
12. Cut off 1/4 of the dough and roll out to a thickness of 1/8 inch.
13. Cut out circles using a glass or a round pastry cutter.
14. Fill each dough circle with 1 teaspoon of sauerkraut filling.
15. Fold dough over into a half-moon shape and seal edges.
16. Cover with a clean dish towel so pierogi won't dry out and repeat with remaining dough and filling.
17. Bring a large pan of salted water to a gentle boil.
18. Add the pierogi in batches and cook until they float to the surface, 5 to 7 minutes.
19. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes once they float to the surface.
20. Remove with a slotted spoon and drizzle with melted butter.
