## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups dark chocolate chips
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, cubed
- 2 teaspoons maple syrup
- 1 ½ cups miniature marshmallows
- 1 ¼ cups lightly salted roasted almonds
- ¼ cup unsweetened cocoa powder

## Instructions

1. Combine dark chocolate chips, butter, and maple syrup in a heat-safe bowl and place over a saucepan filled with about 1 inch of hot water set over the lowest heat setting on the stovetop. Allow mixture to melt; do not stir.
2. While mixture melts, line an 8x8-inch baking pan with plastic wrap.
3. Slowly stir melted chocolate mixture together with a spatula until shiny and smooth. Remove from heat and stir in marshmallows and almonds until combined.
4. Quickly transfer mixture into the prepared baking pan. Distribute evenly but do not smooth or press down the top--try to preserve a rough texture on the top. Let cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until well chilled and firm, about 2 hours.
5. Sift cocoa over the top and cut into 16 squares.
