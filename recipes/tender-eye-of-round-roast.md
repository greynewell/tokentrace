## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon black pepper
- ½ teaspoon dried thyme
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 (3 pound) beef eye of round roast
- ½ cup dry red wine (merlot or cabernet sauvignon)
- ½ cup beef broth
- 2 tablespoons cold butter, cubed
- Reynolds Wrap® Aluminum Foil

## Instructions

1. Mix garlic, oil, salt, pepper, and thyme into a paste; rub all over beef roast. Set aside at room temperature for 1 hour. Forty minutes into the hour, preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).
2. Place two sheets of aluminum foil large enough to cover the beef roast on a baking sheet. Place beef roast on the foil sheets and transfer everything to the oven. Roast in the preheated oven for 18 minutes.
3. Remove from the oven; fold up the foil so it wraps the roast then return it to the oven. Reduce oven temperature to 170 degrees F (75 degrees C) and roast for one hour. After an hour, check the internal temperature with an instant-read thermometer: 120-125 degrees F will yield a rare center, 130-140 degrees F will yield a medium-rare center, and 140-150 degrees F will yield a medium center.
4. Remove roast and set it on a cutting board to rest. Transfer any drippings from roast into a saucepan; stir in red wine and beef broth and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat until reduced by 1/4. Reduce heat to medium-low and whisk in cubes of butter, one at a time, until incorporated into sauce. Add salt and pepper to taste and set aside.
5. Slice the roast into 1/2-inch thick slices and serve with pan sauce poured on top.
