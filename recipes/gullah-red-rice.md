## Ingredients

- 4 slices bacon, chopped
- 1  green bell pepper, chopped
- 1 small onion, chopped
- 2 link (4" long x 1-1/8" dia)s smoked sausage links, sliced
- 1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce (such as Hunt's®)
- 1 (8 ounce) can tomato paste (such as Hunt's®)
- 1 cup water
- 2 cups uncooked parboiled (converted) rice
- 1 tablespoon white sugar

## Instructions

1. Place bacon in a pot and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Add bell pepper and onion to bacon grease and saute over medium heat until soft, about 5 minutes. Add sausage and cook and stir until browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove mixture from the pan to a bowl.

3. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
4. Transfer the rice mixture to a 9x13-inch baking pan. Cover with foil.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until liquid has evaporated and rice is tender, about 25 minutes.
