## Ingredients

- 3 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- 6  potatoes, cut into bite-sized chunks
- 1  onion, chopped
- ½ cup ketchup
- 6 tablespoons brown sugar
- ¼ cup Worcestershire sauce
- ¼ cup white vinegar
- ¼ cup margarine
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 2 teaspoons dry mustard
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 2 teaspoons paprika
- 2 teaspoons chili powder
- 1 pinch red pepper flakes

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
2. Arrange chicken breasts, potatoes, and onion in a large baking dish.
3. Mix ketchup, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, vinegar, margarine, lemon juice, dry mustard, salt, paprika, chili powder, and red pepper flakes in a saucepan. Bring sauce to a boil, stirring constantly to dissolve brown sugar and salt. Pour the sauce over chicken and vegetables. Cover dish with aluminum foil.
