## Ingredients

- 2 cups real maple syrup
- 1 gallon clean fresh snow
- 15  wooden pop sticks

## Instructions

1. Pack clean, fresh snow into a large bowl or baking dish. Smooth the top and place in the freezer.
2. Pour maple syrup into a large saucepan; bring to a boil. Cook and stir with a wooden spoon over medium-low heat until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a firm ball. A candy thermometer inserted into the syrup should read between 235 and 245 degrees F (112 to 118 degrees C).
3. Remove snow from the freezer and set on the counter. Pour about 2 tablespoons syrup per piece over snow in thin lines about 5 inches long. Let syrup strips cool and firm up for 3 to 5 seconds. Pull candy strips out of snow, then wind into a lollipop around the end of a wooden pop stick. Eat while still a little warm.
