## Ingredients

- 8 slices maple-cured bacon
- 7  eggs
- 3 tablespoons brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons ground cinnamon
- 1 tablespoon ground nutmeg
- 4 slices bread
- 5 tablespoons oil, or as needed
- 1 teaspoon maple syrup, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Lay bacon strips in a single layer on prepared baking sheet.
2. Bake in the preheated oven until browned and crisp, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels.
3. Beat 3 eggs, brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a large, shallow bowl. Dip each slice of bread into egg mixture to saturate completely.
4. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Working in batches, cook bread slices in hot oil, turning once, until browned on each side, about 5 minutes. Transfer toast to a plate.
5. Beat remaining eggs in a bowl. Cook and stir eggs in the same skillet over medium heat until eggs are scrambled and set, 3 to 4 minutes.
6. Place 1 slice of toast on a plate and top with 1/2 of the bacon, 1/2 of the scrambled eggs, and 1 slice of toast. Repeat with remaining toast, bacon, and eggs. Top each sandwich with maple syrup.
