## Ingredients

- 1 (12 ounce) package farfalle (bow tie) pasta
- 7 slices bacon
- 1  onion, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 3 tablespoons butter, divided
- 1 cup shredded Gouda cheese
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ½ cup panko bread crumbs
- ½ cup riced broccoli

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a casserole dish.
2. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook bow-tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels, reserving bacon grease in the skillet. Let bacon cool enough to handle, about 5 minutes; crumble and set aside. Drain cooked pasta and set aside.
4. Heat 2 tablespoons bacon grease in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Saute onion and garlic in the hot grease for 2 to 3 minutes. Add crumbled bacon, heavy cream, and 1 tablespoon butter; continue cooking until sauce becomes thick and creamy, 5 to 7 minutes. Mix in gouda cheese and stir until melted. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat and mix pasta into the cream sauce. Pour mixture into the prepared casserole dish.
5. Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a medium, microwave-safe bowl in a microwave for 20 seconds. Mix in panko bread crumbs and riced broccoli; stir very well to coat in butter. Spread mixture on top of pasta.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Remove from the oven.
7. Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
8. Continue to bake in the preheated oven until crumble is browned, about 5 minutes more.
