## Ingredients

- 1 cup milk
- ⅔ cup all-purpose flour
- 3  eggs
- ½ teaspoon granulated garlic
- 1 pinch salt
- ¼ cup butter
- ½ cup chopped red bell pepper
- ½ cup chopped green bell pepper
- ½ cup chopped onion
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 pound shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning
- ½ cup heavy cream
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning
- 2 tablespoons dry white wine

## Instructions

1. Combine milk, flour, and eggs in a blender. Blend on high speed until well mixed, about 1 minute. Let batter rest for 30 minutes.
2. Heat an 8-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Lift pan and pour about 3 tablespoons batter into the center; tilt skillet so batter evenly coats bottom. Cook until top appears dry, 45 to 60 seconds. Flip and cook 15 to 20 seconds more. Remove crepe and stack onto a plate. Repeat with remaining batter; you will have leftover crepes for another use.
3. Melt 2 tablespoons butter for filling in a skillet over medium heat. Add bell peppers and onion; stir-fry until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant. Add remaining butter, shrimp, and Cajun seasoning.
4. Mix cream, flour, and Cajun seasoning together; slowly pour into the shrimp mixture. Cook and stir until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes. Pour in white wine and cook until heated through and thickened as desired, 2 to 5 minutes more.
5. Spoon some of the shrimp filling into the middle of each crepe and roll crepe around filling, or fold in halves or quarters.
