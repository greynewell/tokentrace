## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 cups chopped kale, or to taste
- 2 tablespoons water
- 2  potatoes, cut into 1/4-inch slices
- 4 ounces smoked salmon, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon capers
- 12  eggs, beaten
- 3 ounces crumbled feta cheese

## Instructions

1. Heat butter in a large oven-safe skillet over medium heat; cook and stir kale, about 2 minutes.
2. Add water and cover skillet; cook, stirring frequently, until kale is wilted, about 5 minutes.
3. Remove lid and cook, stirring frequently, until water is evaporated, 2 to 3 minutes.
4. Mix potatoes, salmon, and capers into kale; cook and stir until heated through, 3 to 5 minutes.
5. Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
6. Pour eggs over kale-salmon mixture; cook, stirring gently and scraping the bottom of the skillet to prevent sticking, until barely set, about 5 minutes.
7. Sprinkle feta cheese over egg mixture.
8. Broil in the preheated oven until top is browned and eggs are set and puffed, about 5 minutes.
9. Allow frittata to sit in skillet for a few minutes before serving.
