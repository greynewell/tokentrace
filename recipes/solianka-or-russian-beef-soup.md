- ¾ cup water
- ½ cup unsalted butter
- 3  onions, chopped
- 1 cup cooked diced veal
- 1 cup diced ham
- ¼ pound kielbasa sausage, cut into 1 inch pieces
- 2 quarts beef stock
- 3  bay leaves
- 10  black peppercorns
- 2  dill pickles, diced
- 2 tablespoons capers
- 12  marinated mushrooms
- 1 (28 ounce) can Italian-style whole peeled tomatoes
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 1 ½ tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 12  kalamata olives
- ⅓ cup chopped fresh dill weed
- ¼ teaspoon dried marjoram
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- ¼ cup dill pickle juice
- 1 teaspoon Hungarian sweet paprika

## Instructions

1. Soak mushrooms in water in a small bowl until tender, 20 to 30 minutes. Drain mushrooms, reserving soaking water.
2. Melt 1/4 cup butter in a large pot over medium-high heat. Sauté onions, veal, ham, sausage, and rehydrated mushrooms in melted butter. Add stock and mushroom water; bring to a boil.
3. Make a bouquet garni by tying bay leaves and peppercorns tightly in cheesecloth. Add bouquet garni, marinated mushrooms, pickles, and capers to soup. Reduce heat and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes.
4. Melt remaining 1/4 cup butter in a skillet. Add tomatoes and tomato paste and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, then add flour and cook for 2 to 3 more minutes. Stir 1 cup soup into the skillet, then pour mixture back into the soup pot.
5. Add olives, dill, pickle juice, garlic, paprika, and marjoram. Season with salt and black pepper; simmer for 10 to 15 minutes.
6. Remove the pot from heat and discard bouquet garni. Adjust seasonings and garnish servings with dollops of sour cream and lemon slices.
