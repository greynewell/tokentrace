## Ingredients

- 1 (14 ounce) package refrigerated pie crusts (2 pie crusts)
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 cup fresh raspberries
- 1 cup fresh blackberries
- ½ cup fresh blueberries
- 1  lemon
- 1  egg, beaten
- 1 tablespoon white sugar, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line two small cookie sheets with parchment paper.
2. Unroll pie crust dough rounds separately onto the prepared cookie sheets.
3. Mix together 1/4 cup sugar and flour in a bowl. Sprinkle 1/2 mixture on each dough round, leaving a 1-inch border.
4. Divide and arrange raspberries, blackberries, and blueberries evenly on top of flour-sugar mixture on each dough round. Squeeze juice from 1/2 lemon over each berry mixture.
5. Fold in 1-inch border of dough on each round, pleating as you move, in order to keep all the berry juices inside. Brush beaten egg onto the pleated crusts. Sprinkle both crusts and both berry mixtures with 1 tablespoon sugar.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until crusts are golden, about 25 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes or serve warm.
