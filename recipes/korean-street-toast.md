## Ingredients

- ⅓ cup julienned carrot
- 1 cup thinly sliced green cabbage
- 1 stalk green onion, thinly sliced
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper
- ½ teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste
- 2 large eggs
- 3 tablespoons salted butter, divided
- 2 thick slices white bread
- ½ teaspoon white sugar, or to taste
- 2 thin slices  smoked ham
- 1 slice mild Cheddar cheese
- 1 tablespoon ketchup, or to taste
- 1 tablespoon mayonnaise, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Combine carrot, cabbage, green onion, black pepper, cayenne, and salt. Mix with your hands for about 30 seconds until soft and seasoned. Add eggs and mix thoroughly with a fork; set aside.
2. Heat 2 tablespoons butter in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add bread slices and toss to make sure both sides are well buttered. Grill bread until both sides are beautifully toasted and golden brown and starting to get a little crispy. Remove to a plate.
3. Heat remaining butter in the same skillet over medium heat. Add cabbage mixture; cook and simultaneously mix by using the edge of a spatula to chop down on the surface while pushing the edges up and over the top. As the mixture starts to hold its shape, form into a rectangle that's about twice as long as it is wide. Split the rectangle in half and continue to cook until golden brown; flip and continue on the opposite side, 3 to 4 minutes total.
4. Stack cabbage pieces on top of one another and transfer to toast. Top with sugar.
5. Add ham to the same skillet over medium heat; cook until sizzling. Flip and top ham with Cheddar cheese. Cook until melted, about 1 minute.
6. Place ham on sandwich and squeeze over mayonnaise and ketchup. Top with remaining slice of toast, slice in half, and serve.
