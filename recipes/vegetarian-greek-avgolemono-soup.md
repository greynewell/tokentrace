## Ingredients

- 8 cups water
- 1 pound leeks, white and light green parts only, chopped
- 2 ½ tablespoons vegetable base (such as Better Than Bouillon® Seasoned Vegetable Base)
- ⅔ cup uncooked jasmine rice
- 4 large eggs
- 6 tablespoons lemon juice, or more to taste
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill

## Instructions

1. Combine water, leeks, and vegetable base in a Dutch oven; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 20 minutes. Add rice. Cook at a simmer, stirring often to make sure rice doesn't stick to the bottom, until rice is tender and cooked through, 30 to 45 minutes. Remove from the heat.
2. Beat eggs and 6 tablespoons lemon juice together in a medium bowl until combined. Ladle some hot broth from the pot and pour it slowly into the egg mixture, whisking while pouring. Add one more ladle of broth and whisk to combine. Pour the egg mixture into the soup and stir to combine.
3. Ladle soup into bowls and garnish with dill.
