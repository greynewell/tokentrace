## Ingredients

- ¼ cup butter, melted
- 5 cups all-purpose buttermilk baking mix
- 1 cup lemon-lime soda (such as 7Up®)
- 1 cup sour cream

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Spread melted butter all over a 9x13-inch baking dish.
2. Stir baking mix, lemon-lime soda, sour cream, and softened butter together in a bowl until dough is well-mixed; knead with your hands, adding more baking mix as necessary, until dough is smooth but still sticky.
3. Roll dough into 15 equal-size balls and place dough balls in prepared baking dish, turning to coat each completely in melted butter.
