## Ingredients

- 1 (8 ounce) package small seashell pasta
- 2  eggs
- 2 ounces cooked ham, cut into thin strips
- 1 (10 ounce) package frozen English peas, thawed
- 1 cup shredded Swiss cheese
- ½ cup mayonnaise
- ¼ cup sour cream
- green onions, chopped
- 1 teaspoon prepared mustard
- 1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce
- 1 teaspoon paprika

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until al dente. Rinse under cold water, drain, and set aside.
2. Meanwhile, place eggs in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Over medium heat, bring water to a full boil. Lower heat and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes. Immediately plunge eggs into cold water. Let cool completely, then peel and slice.

4. Pour 3/4 of the dressing over the pasta, and toss to coat thoroughly. Spread the remaining dressing evenly over the top of the pasta salad, all the way to the edge of the bowl. Sprinkle with paprika, cover tightly, and chill 4 hours, or overnight for best flavor.
