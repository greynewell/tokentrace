## Ingredients

- 1 cup whole wheat or white flour
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ⅛ teaspoon white pepper, or to taste
- ⅛ teaspoon black pepper, or to taste
- 2 pounds chicken breast tenderloins or strips
- 2 tablespoons canola oil
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 cups chicken broth
- 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
- 1 (12 ounce) jar quartered marinated artichoke hearts, with liquid
- ¼ cup capers
- 2 tablespoons butter
- ¼ cup chopped flat-leaf parsley

## Instructions

1. Combine flour, salt, and white and black peppers. Dredge chicken in seasoned flour and shake off excess.
2. Heat canola oil and olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken breasts and cook until golden brown on both sides, and no longer pink on the inside; set aside.
3. Pour in chicken broth and lemon juice. Bring to a simmer, scraping the bottom of the pan to dissolve the caramelized bits. Add artichoke hearts and capers, return to a simmer, and cook until reduced by half.
4. Whisk butter into sauce until melted. Place cooked chicken back into pan, and simmer in the sauce for a few minutes to reheat. Serve on a platter sprinkled with chopped fresh parsley.
