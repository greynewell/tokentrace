## Ingredients

- 1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1 ½ cups buttermilk
- ½ cup ricotta cheese
- 2  large eggs
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled
- 1 ½ teaspoons maple extract
- cooking spray
- ¾ cup chopped pecans

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions.
2. Whisk flour, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a mixing bowl.
3. Combine buttermilk, ricotta cheese, and eggs in a large bowl; blend with an electric mixer until smooth. Stir in melted butter and maple extract. Add flour mixture to buttermilk mixture and stir until just combined but still lumpy; don't overmix or the waffles will be tough and chewy.
4. Lightly spray the waffle iron grids with cooking spray, if needed, following the manufacturer's instructions for cooking. Add about 1 cup of batter depending on the size of your waffle iron, spreading evenly, and sprinkle batter with about 2 to 3 tablespoons pecans.
5. Cook until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes, making sure the waffle is fully cooked before lifting the lid (the steam slows down once the waffles are done). Remove waffle, place on a baking sheet without stacking, cover loosely with aluminum foil, and place in the preheated oven to keep warm. Repeat with remaining batter.
