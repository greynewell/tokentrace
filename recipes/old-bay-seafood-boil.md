## Ingredients

- 4  lemons, halved
- 2 medium sweet onions (such as Vidalia®), quartered
- 4  serrano chiles, split in 1/2 lengthwise and seeds and membranes removed
- 2 bunches fresh thyme, tied with string
- 2 heads   garlic, peeled and halved
- 1 ⅔ cups seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®), or more to taste
- 6 teaspoons kosher salt, or more to taste
- 6  bay leaves
- 3 pounds medium red potatoes, cut in 1/2
- 5 (13 ounce) packages smoked kielbasa sausage, cut into 2-inch pieces
- 6 ears sweet corn, halved
- 30  littleneck clams, scrubbed
- 4 pounds jumbo shrimp, deveined, tail on
- 2 ½ pounds Alaskan king crab legs

## Instructions

1. Fill a very large stockpot fitted with a basket insert with about 8 quarts of water, or about halfway full. Squeeze lemons into the water, tossing the halves in too. Add onions, chiles, garlic, thyme, seafood seasoning, kosher salt, and bay leaves; bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes.
2. Stir potatoes into the pot and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes. Next, add sausage and corn; cook another 5 minutes, making sure everything stays covered with the liquid. Add clams and boil until they open, about 8 minutes. Toss in shrimp and shut off the heat. Cover the pot and let shrimp steep in the flavor for 10 minutes, adding crab in the last 5 minutes (press them into the liquid).
3. Drain and spread crab, shrimp, sausage, clams, corn, potatoes, and onions out on a newspaper-covered table or on three large serving trays. Sprinkle with a dusting of Old Bay or provide for individual use.
