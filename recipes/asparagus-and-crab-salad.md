## Ingredients

- 2 pounds fresh asparagus spears, trimmed
- 1 pint grape tomatoes
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- salt and pepper to taste
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- ½ pound bacon strips, diced
- 1 pound imitation crabmeat, flaked
- 4  hearts of palm, drained and sliced
- 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
- 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 clove garlic, minced

## Instructions

1. Preheat an oven to 430 degrees F (225 degrees C).
2. Toss the asparagus, tomatoes, and olive oil together in a bowl until the vegetables are evenly coated; season with salt and pepper. Pour into a baking dish; sprinkle 1 minced clove of garlic over the mixture.
3. Roast in the preheated oven until tender, about 9 minutes. Set aside to cool. Cut the asparagus into 2 inch pieces.
4. Cook the bacon in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat until crisp, about 10 minutes. Remove the bacon to a plate lined with paper towels, reserving 2 tablespoons of the bacon drippings in the skillet. Add the crabmeat to the hot bacon drippings and cook until warmed through, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a large mixing bowl; add the asparagus, tomatoes, and hearts of palm.
5. Whisk the lemon juice, olive oil, and 1 minced clove garlic together in a small bowl; season with salt and pepper. Pour the dressing over the salad and toss to coat. Sprinkle the bacon over the salad just before serving.
