## Ingredients

- ½ sheet nori (dried seaweed), torn into small pieces
- 1 (15 ounce) can no-salt-added chickpeas, drained and rinsed
- ¼ cup vegan mayonnaise
- ⅓ cup minced or finely grated carrot
- ⅓ cup finely diced celery
- 2 tablespoons dried minced onion
- 2 tablespoons fresh dill
- ½ teaspoon salt
- black pepper to taste
- 8 slices whole wheat bread, toasted
- ¼ cup vegan mayonnaise
- 8  lettuce leaves
- 8  tomato slices

## Instructions

1. Pulse nori in a blender until it's a fine powder.
2. Set aside to let dust settle.
3. Mash chickpeas with a sturdy fork or a small-holed potato masher (chickpeas slip through larger, zigzag-type mashers) in a large bowl until most are broken up.
4. Do not overmash--they should retain some texture.
5. Stir in mayo and mash a little more.
6. Stir in nori powder, carrot, celery, onion, dill, salt, and pepper.
7. Cover and chill at least 15 minutes or up to 3 days.
8. For the sandwiches, slather toast with mayo (about 1 1/2 teaspoons per slice).
9. Layer salad, lettuce, and tomato between toast slices.
10. Cut sandwiches in half diagonally.
