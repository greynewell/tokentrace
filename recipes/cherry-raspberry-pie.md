## Ingredients

- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 ¼ cups cold lard
- 5 tablespoons ice water
- 1  egg
- 1 teaspoon white vinegar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 ½ cups white sugar
- 3 tablespoons quick-cooking tapioca
- 2 cups fresh raspberries
- 2 cups fresh tart cherries, pitted
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice
- ¼ teaspoon almond extract
- 1  egg, beaten
- 3 teaspoons heavy cream
- 1 tablespoon coarse sugar, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Pour flour into a bowl and cut in lard. Mix ice water, egg, vinegar, and salt together in a separate bowl. Add to flour mixture and mix until well combined. Divide pastry into halves, wrap in plastic, and chill for at least 1 hour.
2. Combine 1 1/2 cups sugar and tapioca in a bowl. Add raspberries, cherries, lemon juice, and almond extract. Let fruit filling stand 15 minutes.
3. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch glass pie plate.
4. Roll out half the pastry to fit the pie plate. Place bottom crust in the pie plate. Roll the top crust into a 10-inch circle and cut it into 1/2-inch strips using a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Pour fruit filling into pie plate. Moisten the rim of the bottom crust with a small amount of water. Start with the longest strips and lay the first 2 in an 'X' in the center of the pie. Alternate horizontal and vertical strips, weaving them in an over-and-under pattern. Use the shortest strips for the edges of the lattice. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and flute the crust.
5. Stir together egg and cream in a small bowl. Brush lattice with egg mixture and sprinkle with coarse sugar.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour. Remove from oven and cool on a wire rack.
