## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon kosher salt
- 1 ½ pounds salmon fillets
- 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon chopped fresh basil leaves
- 2 teaspoons dried dill weed
- ½ cup Dijon mustard
- 1 ½ cups mayonnaise
- ¾ cup crumbled feta cheese
- 1 cup frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained
- 1 (17.5 ounce) package frozen puff pastry, thawed
- 1  egg white, beaten

## Instructions

1. Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Sprinkle salt on both sides of the salmon. Mix the thyme, oregano, basil, dill, mustard, and mayonnaise in a small bowl and spread over the salmon, then sprinkle the feta cheese on top. Layer the spinach over the feta cheese.
3. Roll the pastry out wide enough and long enough to wrap around the salmon, about 1/4 inch thickness. Place the salmon in the center of the pastry and fold the pastry over the salmon. Place the roll seam-side down on a baking sheet. Cut several small slits in the pastry to allow steam to escape. Brush the egg white onto the pastry.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until the pastry is golden brown and the salmon flakes easily with a fork, about 45 minutes.
