## Ingredients

- ½ pound bacon, chopped
- ½ large onion, chopped
- 5 leaves collard greens - rinsed, trimmed and chopped
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 teaspoon greens seasoning, divided
- 1 head cabbage, chopped
- 1 pinch white sugar

## Instructions

1. Fry the bacon with the onion in a large skillet over medium heat until the bacon is crisp, about 10 minutes. Stir in the chopped collard greens, sprinkle with salt, black pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon of the greens seasoning; cook and stir for 5 minutes.
2. Add in the darker chopped cabbage leaves, and cook and stir until almost tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in the remaining cabbage; season with salt, black pepper, sugar, and the remaining greens seasoning. Stir well; cover and cook until tender, stirring occasionally so that the greens do not scorch, about 10 minutes.
