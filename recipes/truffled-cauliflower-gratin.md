## Ingredients

- 7 tablespoons butter, divided
- ½ cup all-purpose flour
- 3 cups milk
- 5 ounces truffled pecorino cheese, grated, or more to taste
- 1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper, or more to taste
- 1 pinch ground nutmeg
- 1 large head cauliflower, cored and separated into florets
- 2 tablespoons bread crumbs
- 2 tablespoons finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, or more to taste
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Butter a 9x13-inch baking dish with 1 tablespoon butter.
2. Melt remaining 6 tablespoons butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Whisk flour into butter; cook and stir until raw flour taste cooks off, 2 to 3 minutes.
3. Gradually whisk milk into flour mixture. Increase heat to medium-high; cook and stir until mixture thickens and comes to a simmer, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir truffled pecorino cheese, salt, cayenne pepper, and nutmeg into milk mixture until cheese sauce thickens.
4. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil; add cauliflower and cook until slightly tender, about 6 minutes. Drain and transfer cauliflower to the prepared baking dish.
5. Spread cheese sauce evenly over cauliflower. Dust with bread crumbs and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Drizzle olive oil on top and sprinkle with a pinch of cayenne pepper.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until browned and bubbling, about 30 minutes. Garnish with chopped fresh chives.
