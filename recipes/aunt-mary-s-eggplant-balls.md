## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 4 cups cubed eggplant, with peel
- 1 tablespoon water
- ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 cup chopped fresh parsley
- 2  eggs, beaten
- ¾ cup dried bread crumbs

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.
