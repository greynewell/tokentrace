## Ingredients

- 1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed
- 1 cup Romanesco cauliflower florets
- 1 ½ tablespoons butter
- 1 ½ cups sliced fresh mushrooms
- 1 tablespoon fresh oregano leaves
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons water  (Optional)
- 3  eggs
- ½ cup milk
- 2 tablespoons milk
- ½ cup heavy whipping cream
- 2 tablespoons heavy whipping cream

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a 9-inch quiche pan with parchment paper.
2. Press puff pastry into the quiche pan and trim to fit. Prick pastry with a fork and place in the refrigerator.
