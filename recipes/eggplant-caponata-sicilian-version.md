## Ingredients

- 1  eggplant, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes
- salt to taste
- ¼ cup olive oil, divided
- 1 cup finely chopped celery
- 1  onion, finely chopped
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 ½ cups canned plum tomatoes, drained and coarsely chopped
- 12  green olives, pitted and coarsely chopped

- 1 tablespoon tomato paste
- 1 teaspoon minced oregano
- 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
- 2 teaspoons white sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt

## Instructions

1. Toss eggplant with salt and place in a colander set over a bowl. Let sit, about 30 minutes. Rinse and pat dry.
2. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add celery; cook, stirring often, until softened, about 4 minutes. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until onion is soft and lightly golden, about 5 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a bowl using a slotted spoon.
3. Heat remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in the skillet. Add eggplant and cook, stirring constantly, until lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in celery mixture, tomatoes, olives, capers, tomato paste, and oregano. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered until caponata is thickened, about 15 minutes.
