## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons kosher salt
- 1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 tablespoon smoked paprika
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1 teaspoon dried rosemary
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary leaves
- 1 (2 1/2 pound) beef tri-tip roast
- ½ cup beef broth  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C).
2. Mix salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder, cayenne, dried rosemary, and fresh rosemary together in a small bowl.
3. Place tri-tip in a baking pan. Season generously with the spice rub until both sides are completely covered.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part reads 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for medium-rare, or until desired doneness, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Flip meat over halfway.
5. Cover pan with aluminum foil and let meat rest for 20 minutes. Remove tri-tip to a cutting board and cut into 2 pieces along where the grain changes direction. Slice meat across the grain and transfer to serving plates.
6. Mix beef broth in with the pan drippings and drizzle over the slices.
