## Ingredients

- 2 (8 ounce) boneless rib-eye steaks
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 pinch garlic powder, or to taste
- 1 pinch Montreal steak seasoning, or to taste
- ⅓ cup extra virgin olive oil
- ⅓ cup Worcestershire sauce
- ⅓ cup soy sauce
- ⅓ cup balsamic vinegar
- 3 tablespoons Dijon mustard
- 3 cloves garlic, chopped
- 1 dash liquid smoke flavoring

## Instructions

1. Place steaks in a flat baking dish or container. Cut slits at 1-inch intervals in the fat around the edges of the steaks. Gently pierce both sides of each steak a few times with a fork.
2. Sprinkle each steak with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and Montreal steak seasoning. Pat seasonings into steaks.
3. Whisk olive oil, Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, balsamic vinegar, Dijon mustard, garlic, and liquid smoke together in a bowl. Pour marinade over steaks to coat. Cover container or baking dish with plastic wrap and marinate steaks in the refrigerator for 2 hours. Turn steaks over and marinate for another 2 hours.
4. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
5. Cook the steaks on the preheated grill until they start to firm, and are reddish-pink and juicy in the center, 8 to 10 minutes per side for medium-rare. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C).
