## Ingredients

- 3 pounds beef rump roast
- 2 large onions, chopped
- 1 cup red wine vinegar, or to taste
- 1 cup water
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 1 tablespoon ground black pepper
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 10  whole cloves, or more to taste
- 2  bay leaves, or more to taste
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Place beef rump roast, onions, vinegar, water, 1 tablespoon salt, 1 tablespoon black pepper, sugar, cloves, and bay leaves in a large pot. Cover and refrigerate for 2 to 3 days, turning meat daily. Remove meat from marinade and pat dry with paper towels, reserving marinade.
