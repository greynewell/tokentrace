## Ingredients

- 1 cube chicken bouillon (such as Knorr®)
- 2 cups hot water
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- ¼ cup finely diced onion
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 cup Arborio rice
- ¼ cup white wine
- 2 tablespoons butter
- ¼ cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
- 2 teaspoons chopped fresh parsley  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Dissolve chicken bouillon cube in hot water and set aside.
2. Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot) and select Saute function. Add olive oil to the pot. Add onion and cook for 1 minute.
