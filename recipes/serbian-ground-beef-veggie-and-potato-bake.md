## Ingredients

- 1 pound ground beef
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1  green bell pepper, chopped
- 1  onion, chopped
- 1  carrot, shredded
- 2  celery stalks, chopped
- ½ tablespoon paprika
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¾ teaspoon black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper
- 1 pinch ground cinnamon
- 1 pinch ground cloves
- ¼ cup water
- ⅛ cup red wine
- 1 cube beef bouillon
- 2 tablespoons half-and-half
- 2  potatoes, peeled and sliced

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a casserole dish.
2. Cook and stir ground beef in a skillet over medium heat until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer beef and juices to a bowl.
3. Heat oil in the same skillet. Add onion, bell pepper, celery, and carrot; sauté until vegetables are tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Return beef to the skillet and season with paprika, black pepper, salt, red pepper flakes, cinnamon, and cloves. Stir in water and wine and cook until heated through, about 5 minutes. Add bouillon and stir until dissolved, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in half-and-half.
4. Layer 1/2 of the potatoes over the bottom of the prepared casserole dish. Pour beef and vegetable mixture over potatoes, then layer remaining potatoes over top.
5. Cover the dish and cook in the preheated oven until potatoes are tender, about 45 minutes.
