## Ingredients

- 2 teaspoons coconut oil, or as needed
- ¼ cup raisins
- 1 cup warm water
- ¼ cup coconut oil, softened
- ¼ cup butter, softened
- ½ cup brown sugar

- ⅔ cup grated carrot
- ½ cup bread flour
- ½ cup whole-wheat flour
- 1 tablespoon ground flax seed
- ½ teaspoon baking soda

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups with 2 teaspoons coconut oil.
