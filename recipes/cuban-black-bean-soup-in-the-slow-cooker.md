## Ingredients

- 1 (8 ounce) package dry black beans
- 2 stalks celery, cut into thirds
- 2  bay leaves
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1  onion, diced
- 1  green bell pepper, diced
- 1 large carrot, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, crushed
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon hot chile flakes
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can fire-roasted diced tomatoes
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can water

## Instructions

1. Rinse beans and remove any particles or bad beans; place in a saucepan and cover with 2 inches water. Add celery and bay leaves. Bring to a boil and cook over high heat, adding more water as necessary, for 10 minutes. Drain beans and remove and discard celery.
2. Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add onion, bell pepper, and carrot; saute until onions are fairly translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic, cumin, and chile flakes; continue to cook until heated through and fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the heat.
3. Place tomatoes and water in a slow cooker. Add onion mixture, beans, and bay leaves.
