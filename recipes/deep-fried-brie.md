## Ingredients

- 1  egg
- salt and pepper to taste
- 1 (8 ounce) wedge Brie cheese, cut into 1 inch cubes
- ½ cup dry bread crumbs
- 3 cups oil for deep frying
- 1 cup cranberry sauce

## Instructions

1. In a small bowl, whisk the egg with some salt and pepper using a fork. Place the bread crumbs in a separate bowl. Dip the cubes of Brie into the egg, then roll in breadcrumbs until evenly coated and well covered. Place the cheese cubes on a tray, and refrigerate for about 20 minutes, to firm up.
2. Heat oil in deep-fryer or heavy saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Fry the cheese cubes for 3 to 5 minutes, until deep golden brown. Remove with a slotted spoon, and drain on paper towels. Serve warm with cranberry sauce for dipping. You can also make these before your guests arrive, and keep them in a warm oven.
