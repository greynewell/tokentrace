## Ingredients

- ¾ cup scalded milk
- ⅓ cup granulated sugar
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1 (.25 ounce) envelope active dry yeast
- ¼ cup warm water
- 4 cups sifted all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg  (Optional)
- ⅓ cup butter or margarine
- 2  eggs, beaten
- oil for deep frying
- 2 cups confectioners' sugar
- 6 tablespoons milk

## Instructions

1. Stir together scalded milk, sugar, and salt in a large bowl; set aside to cool until tepid. Dissolve yeast in warm water in a small bowl; let stand until creamy, about 5 minutes.
2. Stir together flour and nutmeg in a bowl. Add 2 cups flour mixture to milk mixture; beat until well-blended.
3. Stir yeast mixture into milk and flour mixture, then mix in butter and eggs. Mix in remaining flour mixture, 1/2 cup at a time. When dough is firm enough, turn it onto a floured surface and knead for 3 to 4 minutes. Place into an oiled bowl, cover, and allow dough to rise until doubled, 30 to 35 minutes.
4. Roll dough out on a lightly floured surface to 1/2-inch thickness. Cut into circles using a donut or round cutter. Set aside to rise until light, 30 to 40 minutes.
5. Heat 1-inch-deep oil in a deep, heavy frying pan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
6. Fry donuts in hot oil a few at a time. Cook each side until golden brown, then remove to drain on paper towels. Glaze while warm, or sprinkle with sugar.
7. Stir together confectioners' sugar and 6 tablespoons milk in a bowl until smooth. Dip warm donuts into glaze; set aside to cool.
