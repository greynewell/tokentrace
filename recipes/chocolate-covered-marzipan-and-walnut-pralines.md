## Ingredients

- 3 ½ (4 ounce) packages marzipan
- 1 cup powdered sugar, divided
- 1 cup chopped walnuts
- 2 teaspoons rum
- 2 teaspoons maraschino liqueur
- 5 (3 ounce) bars dark chocolate, finely chopped
- 50 halves walnut halves

## Instructions

1. Knead marzipan with 3/4 cup powdered sugar, chopped walnuts, rum, and maraschino liqueur on a clean work surface until smooth.
2. Sprinkle remaining powdered sugar on a clean work surface. Roll out marzipan and cut out circles, squares, or rectangles.
3. Line a baking sheet with waxed paper and set a wire rack on top.
4. Place 3/4 of the chocolate in the top of a double boiler over simmering water. Stir frequently, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, until chocolate is melted, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in remaining dark chocolate until smooth.
5. Stick a toothpick or metal skewer into each praline and dip into the melted chocolate, letting excess drip off. Set onto the wire rack. Allow chocolate to set a little, then place 1 walnut half on top of the chocolate.
6. Allow chocolate to harden completely. Store pralines in airtight containers.
