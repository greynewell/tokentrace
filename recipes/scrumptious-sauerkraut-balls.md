## Ingredients

- 1 pound pork sausage
- ¼ cup finely chopped onion
- 1 (14 ounce) can sauerkraut, well drained and finely chopped
- ½ teaspoon prepared yellow mustard
- ¼ teaspoon garlic salt
- ⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons Italian seasoned dry bread crumbs
- 4 ounces cream cheese, softened
- 2 tablespoons dried parsley flakes
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- 1  egg, beaten
- ¼ cup milk
- ¾ cup Italian seasoned dry bread crumbs
- 6 cups vegetable oil for deep-frying

## Instructions

1. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage and onion in the hot skillet until sausage is crumbly and browned, about 10 minutes. Drain grease and allow to cool slightly.
2. Transfer sausage mixture into a large bowl. Stir in drained sauerkraut, 2 tablespoons bread crumbs, mustard, garlic salt, and pepper. Combine cream cheese and parsley in a small bowl; mix into sauerkraut mixture. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour.
3. Place flour into a shallow bowl. Whisk together egg and milk in another bowl. Place 3/4 cup bread crumbs in a third bowl.
4. Heat oil in a deep fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
5. Shape sauerkraut mixture into 3/4-inch balls. Coat balls in flour, then dip in egg mixture and roll in bread crumbs to thoroughly coat.
6. Working in batches, fry balls in hot oil until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate and serve hot.
