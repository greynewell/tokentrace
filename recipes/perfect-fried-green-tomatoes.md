## Ingredients

- 4  green tomatoes, cut into 1/4-inch slices
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons salt, divided
- 2 teaspoons ground black pepper, divided
- 1 cup buttermilk
- 1 cup cornmeal
- 1 teaspoon dried parsley
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 2 cups canola oil, or as needed
- ½ cup ranch dressing
- 2 tablespoons Cajun seasoning
- 2 teaspoons hot pepper sauce

## Instructions

1. Season tomato slices with salt and pepper.
2. Combine flour, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper in a shallow bowl. Pour buttermilk into a second shallow bowl. Mix cornmeal, parsley, paprika, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon pepper, and cayenne pepper in a third shallow bowl.
3. Dredge each tomato slice in flour mixture to coat, dip into buttermilk, and finish by pressing both sides of tomato into cornmeal mixture to coat. Lay coated tomato slices on a baking sheet; set aside to let tomatoes absorb the coating, 10 to 15 minutes.
4. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
5. Gently drop tomato slices into hot oil and cook until golden brown and floating, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain on a plate lined with paper towels.
