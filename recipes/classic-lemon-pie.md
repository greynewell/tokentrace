## Ingredients

- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 cup milk
- ¼ cup unsalted butter, melted
- ¼ cup lemon juice
- 3 large egg yolks, slightly beaten
- 3 tablespoons cornstarch
- 1 tablespoon lemon zest
- 1 cup sour cream
- 1 (9 inch) baked pie crust
- 3 large egg whites
- ⅓ cup white sugar
- 1 teaspoon cornstarch

## Instructions

1. Combine sugar, milk, butter, lemon juice, egg yolks, cornstarch, and lemon zest in a medium saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until thick, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from heat, cover, and let cool, about 30 minutes.
2. Fold in sour cream; pour into the baked pie crust. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.
3. Beat egg whites, sugar, and cornstarch together in a bowl using an electric mixer until stiff peaks form. Spread meringue on top of filling, right up to the edge of the crust.
4. Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
5. Broil in the preheated oven until meringue is lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Serve immediately.
