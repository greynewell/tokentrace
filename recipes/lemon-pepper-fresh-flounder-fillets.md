## Ingredients

- 1 cup bran cereal (such as Fiber One®)
- 2 teaspoons lemon-pepper seasoning
- 2 cups vegetable oil for frying
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1  egg
- 1 tablespoon milk
- 4 (4 ounce) flounder fillets

## Instructions

1. Place bran cereal in a blender; blend until pulverized. Transfer to a shallow bowl and mix in lemon-pepper seasoning.
2. Heat oil in a deep skillet over medium heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
3. Place flour in a medium bowl. Whisk egg and milk together in another medium bowl. Dredge a flounder fillet in flour; shake off excess. Dip into egg mixture. Lift up so excess egg drips back in the bowl. Press into crushed bran to coat both sides. Place the breaded flounder, unstacked, onto a plate. Repeat with remaining fillets.
4. Add fillets to the hot oil and deep fry for 3 minutes, turning once halfway through. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.
