## Ingredients

- 1 (9 inch) unbaked deep dish pie crust
- ¾ cup white sugar
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground ginger
- ¼ teaspoon ground cloves
- 2  eggs
- 1 (15 ounce) can LIBBY'S® 100% Pure Pumpkin
- 1 (12 fluid ounce) can NESTLE® CARNATION® Evaporated Milk

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine sugar, cinnamon, salt, ginger, and cloves in small bowl. Beat eggs lightly in large bowl. Stir in pumpkin and sugar-spice mixture. Gradually stir in evaporated milk. Pour into pie shell.
3. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue to bake until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean, 40 to 50 more minutes. Remove from the oven and set on a wire rack to cool to room temperature.
4. Serve cooled pie immediately or refrigerate until ready to serve. (Do not freeze as this will cause the crust to separate from the filling.)
