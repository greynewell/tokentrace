## Ingredients

- 8  yellow summer squash, thinly sliced
- 1 small yellow onion, thinly sliced
- 1  egg, lightly beaten
- 1 cup low-fat sour cream
- 1 sleeve buttery round crackers (such as Ritz®), crushed, divided
- 2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese, divided

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 1-quart casserole dish.
2. Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add squash and onion, cover, and steam until squash is tender and easily mashed with a fork, 10 to 15 minutes.
