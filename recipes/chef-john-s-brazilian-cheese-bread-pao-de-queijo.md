## Ingredients

- 2 ¼ cups tapioca flour, or more as needed
- ⅔ cup milk
- ½ cup mild olive oil
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 2 ounces freshly grated mozzarella cheese
- 2 ounces finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
- 2 large eggs, beaten
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone mat.
2. Place tapioca flour in a mixing bowl; set aside.
3. Combine milk, olive oil, and salt in a pan. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Immediately remove from heat and pour into tapioca in the bowl. Mix until a shaggy dough starts to form. Let rest for 5 minutes.
4. Add eggs, mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses, and cayenne to the bowl; stir with a fork until thoroughly combined. Use a medium ice cream scoop to portion dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Poke down any jagged bits using a wet finger if desired.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until rolls are puffed and golden, about 20 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes and serve warm.
