## Ingredients

- 1 pound cod fillets
- ½ pound lightly smoked cod, skin and bones removed
- ½  lemon
- 1 sprig fresh thyme
- 1 pound parsnip, chopped
- ½ pound potatoes
- 3 tablespoons butter
- 1  onion, chopped
- 1 cup milk
- 1 cup heavy whipping cream
- salt to taste
- ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. If the smoked cod has a strong smoky flavor, soak it in water for 30 minutes, drain, and rinse.
2. In a large saucepan, cover the cod and smoked cod with water, and add the juice of half a lemon and the thyme. Bring the cooking liquid to a gentle simmer. Poach the fish for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the fish is just cooked and tender. Remove the fish to a bowl, and reserve the poaching liquid. When the fish has cooled enough to handle, break it into large bite-sized pieces. Set aside.
3. While the cod is cooking, peel the parsnips, and cut them into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Peel the potatoes, cut them into 1/2 inch dice, and place them in a bowl of water to prevent discoloring.
4. In a large saucepan or kettle, melt 2 tablespoons of butter or margarine over medium heat. Add onion, and cook until wilted and golden. Add the parsnips, potatoes, and 3 cups of the reserved poaching liquid. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat, and cover. Simmer for 15 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender.
5. Heat the milk and cream in a small saucepan. Do not boil. Stir to the vegetable mixture.
6. Add cod and smoked cod; stir. Season with salt and freshly ground pepper to taste. Just before serving, stir in remaining tablespoon of butter. Top each serving with freshly ground pepper and chives.
