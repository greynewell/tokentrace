## Ingredients

- ½ cup olive oil
- 3 tablespoons white sugar
- 1 teaspoon dried rosemary
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 8  Roma (plum) tomatoes, halved lengthwise
- 2  shallots, halved lengthwise and peeled
- ½ cup balsamic vinegar
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 1 ¾ cups olive oil
- 4  romaine hearts
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C). Mix olive oil, white sugar, rosemary, thyme, salt, and pepper in a large resealable plastic bag. Place tomatoes in the bag, seal, and shake to coat. Arrange coated tomato halves cut side up on a baking sheet. Bake tomatoes 2 1/2 hours in the preheated oven. Remove from heat, and let cool.
2. In a blender or food processor, finely chop the shallots. Add vinegar and brown sugar, and process until smooth. Slowly add 1 3/4 cups oil, processing frequently, so as to thicken the mixture.
3. Preheat grill for high heat. Brush romaine hearts with 1 tablespoon olive oil, and season with salt and pepper.
4. Place romaine hearts on the preheated grill. Cook 5 to 10 minutes, turning frequently, until slightly charred but not heated all the way through. Serve warm on salad plates surrounded by tomato pieces and drizzled with the shallot dressing.
