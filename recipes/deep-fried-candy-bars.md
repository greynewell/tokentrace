## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 cup corn flour
- ⅛ teaspoon baking soda
- 2 cups milk, or as needed
- 1 cup vegetable oil for frying
- 2  chilled full-size chocolate-covered, nougat-filled candy bars (such as Snickers®)

2. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or deep skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
3. Dip the candy bars in the batter to coat.
