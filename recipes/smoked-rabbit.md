## Ingredients

- ¾ cup water
- ½ cup apple cider vinegar
- ¼ cup dry white wine
- 1 tablespoon kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 (3 pound) whole rabbit
- 1 tablespoon kosher salt
- ½ tablespoon freshly ground black pepper
- ½ teaspoon paprika
- ½ teaspoon onion powder
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon dried oregano
- ½ teaspoon dried parsley flakes

## Instructions

1. Whisk water, apple cider vinegar, wine, salt, pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder together for the brine. Place rabbit in a 1-gallon plastic resealable bag. Pour brine over the rabbit and seal. Lay flat and refrigerate for 24 hours.
2. Combine salt, pepper, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, oregano, and parsley flakes in a small bowl. Stir until evenly combined.
