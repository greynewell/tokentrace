## Ingredients

- ¾ cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
- ½ cup vegetable oil
- 2 cups white sugar
- 2 teaspoons coconut extract
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 4  eggs
- 3 cups self-rising flour
- 1 cup unsweetened coconut milk
- ½ cup pineapple juice
- ¼ cup confectioners' sugar, or more as needed
- ¼ cup pineapple juice
- 1 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 1 teaspoon coconut extract
- ¼ cup shredded coconut
- 1 (20 ounce) can crushed pineapple, drained

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 9-inch square pans.
2. Beat 3/4 cup butter in a bowl using an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Slowly drizzle oil into creamed butter while continuing to beat butter until mixture is smooth. Beat white sugar, 1 cup at a time, into butter mixture until incorporated. Add 2 teaspoons coconut extract and vanilla extract; mix well. Beat eggs, 1 at a time, into butter mixture, beating well until each egg is fully incorporated.
3. Mix flour, alternating with coconut milk, into butter mixture, ending with flour until batter is just mixed. Mix 1/2 cup pineapple juice into batter. Pour batter into the prepared pans.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of each cake comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes.
5. Mix confectioners' sugar and 1/4 cup pineapple juice together in a bowl until sugar is dissolved. Beat 1 cup butter into sugar mixture until light and fluffy. Add 1 teaspoon coconut extract; beat until icing is smooth, adding more confectioners' sugar until desired consistency is reached.
6. Place 1 cake on a serving platter and top with a layer of icing. Place second cake over icing layer. Cover entire cake with remaining icing. Dust sides of cake with shredded coconut and top with crushed pineapple.
