## Ingredients

- 1  butternut squash, halved and seeded
- 1 tablespoon butter, melted
- 1 teaspoon salt, divided
- ¾ teaspoon pumpkin pie spice, divided
- ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1 tablespoon butter
- ½ cup chopped yellow onion
- 1 teaspoon yellow curry powder
- 1 (13 ounce) can coconut milk
- 2 ½ cups vegetable stock, or more if needed
- ¼ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
- ½ cup pepitas (pumpkin seeds)
- 1 pinch freshly grated nutmeg, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Place butternut squash in a baking dish, flesh side up. Brush 1 tablespoon melted butter over the flesh and top with 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice, and cayenne pepper.
3. Roast in the preheated oven until tender, about 1 hour. Remove squash from oven and cool for 15 minutes.
4. Place a large stockpot over medium heat; add 1 tablespoon butter. Cook and stir onion in the melted butter for 2 minutes. Add curry powder; cook and stir for 1 minute. Stir in coconut milk; bring to a boil.
5. Scoop flesh from the butternut squash and add to coconut milk mixture; mix in remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice, vegetable stock, and 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until soup is heated through.
6. Blend soup using an immersion blender on low speed. Simmer until soup is smooth and thickened, about 20 minutes more. Add more vegetable stock for a thinner consistency and season with salt.
7. Ladle soup into bowls and top each with pepitas and a pinch of nutmeg.
