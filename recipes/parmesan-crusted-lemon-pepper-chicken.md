## Ingredients

- 4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- 3 tablespoons butter, melted
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ cup plain dry bread crumbs
- ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 tablespoon dried parsley
- ½ teaspoon dried basil

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan.
2. Place chicken breasts on a flat work surface. Slice horizontally through the thickest part of the breasts, being careful not to cut all the way through to the other side. Open the 2 sides and spread them out like an open book.
3. Combine butter, lemon juice, garlic, salt, and pepper in a shallow dish.
4. Combine bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, parsley, and basil in another dish.
5. Dip chicken in butter mixture, then coat in Parmesan-crumb mixture. Place into the prepared baking pan.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until chicken breasts are no longer pink and juices run clear, 25 to 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a breast should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
