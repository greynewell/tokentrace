## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 8  pork chops
- 1 teaspoon seasoned salt
- 1 (10.75 ounce) can  condensed cream of celery soup
- ⅔ cup milk
- ½ cup sour cream
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 (16 ounce) package frozen hash brown potatoes, thawed
- ¾ cup shredded Cheddar cheese
- ½ (6 ounce) can French-fried onions
- ¼ cup shredded Cheddar cheese
- ½ (6 ounce) can French-fried onions

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Season pork chops with seasoned salt. Cook pork chops in hot oil until browned completely, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove pork chops to a plate lined with paper towels to drain.
3. Mix celery soup, milk, sour cream, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Fold hash brown potatoes, 3/4 cup Cheddar cheese, and about 1/2 of the French-fried onions into the soup mixture; pour into a 13x9-inch baking dish. Arrange pork chops on top of the mixture. Cover the dish with aluminum foil.
4. Bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes. Remove foil and top pork chops with 1/4 cup Cheddar cheese and remaining French-fried onions; continue baking until the cheese melts, about 5 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the pork chops should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
