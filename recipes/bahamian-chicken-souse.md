## Ingredients

- 24  chicken wings, separated
- 3 tablespoons lime juice
- 1 teaspoon seasoned salt
- 1 teaspoon vegetable oil
- 1 large onion, diced
- ½  green pepper, diced
- 6 large potatoes, peeled and diced
- 3  carrots, diced
- ½ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
- 1 tablespoon ground allspice
- 2  bay leaves
- ¾ cup lime juice
- 3 cups water
- salt and black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Toss the chicken wings with 3 tablespoons lime juice and the seasoned salt. Set aside to marinate at room temperature for 1 hour.
2. Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion and green pepper; cook and stir until the onion has softened and begun to brown, about 10 minutes. Add the potatoes, carrots, red pepper flakes, allspice, bay leaves, marinated chicken, lime juice, and water. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and continue simmering until the chicken is no longer pink at the bone, and the vegetables are tender, about 40 minutes.
