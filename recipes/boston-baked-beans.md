## Ingredients

- 2 cups navy beans
- ½ pound bacon
- 1  onion, finely diced
- 3 tablespoons molasses
- 2 teaspoons salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon dry mustard
- ½ cup ketchup
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- ¼ cup brown sugar

## Instructions

1. Transfer soaked navy beans and soaking water to a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until tender, approximately 1 to 2 hours. Drain and reserve the cooking liquid.
2. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
3. Arrange 1/2 of the beans in the bottom of a 2-quart casserole dish. Place 1/2 of the bacon strips over the beans and sprinkle 1/2 of the onions over top. Repeat layers once more.
4. Combine ketchup, molasses, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper, and dry mustard in a large saucepan over medium heat; bring to a boil.
5. Pour sauce over the beans. Pour in just enough reserved cooking liquid to cover the beans. Cover the casserole dish with a lid or aluminum foil.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 1 1/2 hours. Remove the lid and continue to cook, checking every 1/2 hour or so and adding more cooking liquid if necessary to prevent the beans from getting too dry, until beans are tender, 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 more hours.
