## Ingredients

- 2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
- 2 cups warm water
- 6 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- ½ cup white sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ cup melted shortening
- 2 large eggs
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Dissolve yeast in warm water in a mixing bowl. Let stand until yeast is frothy, about 5 minutes.
2. Add 2 cups flour, sugar, and salt to the yeast mixture. Beat with an electric mixer for 2 minutes. Add shortening and eggs; beat for 2 minutes more. Slowly add remaining flour and mix well. Let dough rise in a warm place, undisturbed, until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
3. Punch down dough and divide into 42 pieces. Shape each piece into a ball and arrange on a rimmed baking sheet. Let rolls rise in a warm spot, undisturbed, until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and gently brush tops with butter.
