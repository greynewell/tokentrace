## Ingredients

- ¼ cup margarine
- ¼ cup milk
- ¼ cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 ¼ teaspoons active dry yeast
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 2 teaspoons anise seed
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 2  eggs, beaten
- 2 teaspoons orange zest
- ¼ cup white sugar
- ¼ cup orange juice
- 1 tablespoon orange zest
- 2 tablespoons white sugar

## Instructions

1. Make bread: Heat milk and margarine in a medium saucepan over low heat until margarine melts. Remove from heat and add warm water. Mixture should be around 110 degrees F (43 degrees C).
2. Combine 1 cup flour, sugar, anise seed, yeast, and salt in a large bowl. Beat in warm milk mixture, then add eggs and orange zest; beat until well combined. Stir in 1/2 cup flour and continue adding more flour until dough is soft.
3. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic. Place dough into a lightly greased bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, 1 to 2 hours.
4. Punch dough down and shape into a large round loaf with a round knob on top. Place dough onto a baking sheet; loosely cover with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm place until just about doubled in size, about 1 hour.
5. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
6. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 35 to 45 minutes. Cool slightly before brushing with glaze.
7. Make glaze: Combine 1/4 cup sugar, orange juice, and orange zest in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat and boil for 2 minutes. Brush glaze over top of warm bread. Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons sugar.
