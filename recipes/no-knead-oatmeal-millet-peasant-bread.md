## Ingredients

- 1 cup boiling water
- ½ cup rolled oats
- ¼ cup millet
- 2 ¼ teaspoons active dry yeast
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt
- ⅔ cup warm water (98 to 115 degrees F/37 to 46 degrees C)
- 2 ¾ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon cornmeal, or more as needed

## Instructions

1. Combine boiling water, oats, and millet in a large bowl.
2. Let cool to 100 degrees F (38 degrees C), about 10 minutes.
3. Dissolve yeast and salt in warm water in a small bowl.
4. Let stand until bubbly, about 5 minutes.
5. Stir into the oat-millet mixture.
6. Add 2 3/4 cups flour; stir until dough forms a loose ball.
7. Cover with plastic wrap; let rise in a warm, draft-free location until doubled in volume, about 2 hours.
8. Dust a cutting board with 1 tablespoon flour.
9. Turn the dough out onto the board.
10. Tuck in the edges gradually to shape dough into a boule (rustic, French-style ball) without kneading.
11. Cover with a clean dish towel; let rise until nearly doubled in volume, about 40 minutes.
12. Preheat oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C).
13. Place a lidded Dutch oven inside.
14. Make 3 slashes on top of the dough boule using a serrated knife.
15. Remove hot Dutch oven from the oven carefully.
16. Uncover; sprinkle cornmeal over the bottom and place boule inside; cover with the lid.
17. Reduce oven heat to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
18. Bake in the preheated oven for 28 minutes.
19. Remove the lid and reduce oven temperature to 425 degrees F (218 degrees C).
20. Continue baking until top is golden brown, 12 to 14 minutes more.
21. Carefully lift loaf out of pan onto a work surface and gently tap bottom of loaf; if it sounds hollow, bread is done.
22. Let cool for at least 1 hour on a wire rack.
