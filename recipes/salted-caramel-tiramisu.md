## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups brewed espresso, at room temperature
- 4 tablespoons brandy-based orange liqueur (such as Grand Marnier®), divided
- 4 tablespoons white sugar, divided
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 3  egg yolks
- 1 cup mascarpone cheese
- 1 cup heavy whipping cream
- 1 (3 ounce) package savoiardi biscuits (ladyfingers)
- 2 tablespoons grated bittersweet chocolate, or to taste
- 2 tablespoons cocoa powder, divided, or as needed
- 1 cup white sugar
- ¼ cup cold water
- ½ cup heavy cream
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Combine brewed espresso, 2 tablespoons liqueur, 1 tablespoon sugar, and vanilla extract in a wide bowl. Set aside.
2. Set a bowl over a saucepan of barely simmering water. Add remaining liqueur, 3 tablespoons sugar, and egg yolks to the bowl. Beat using an electric mixer on medium speed until tripled in volume, 5 to 8 minutes. Remove from heat and beat in mascarpone cheese until just combined. Let cool, 5 to 10 minutes.
3. Whip cream in a bowl using an electric mixer until it holds stiff peaks, 3 to 4 minutes. Fold 1/2 of the whipped cream into the cooled mascarpone mixture. Fold in remaining cream until fully incorporated; whipped cream will deflate a little.
4. Dip 1/2 of the ladyfingers very quickly into the espresso mixture. Line the bottom of a 9-inch square dish with cookies, breaking a few to fit as needed. Spoon 1/2 of the mascarpone filling over and spread into an even layer. Top with grated chocolate.
5. Dip remaining ladyfingers quickly into espresso and arrange a second layer over filling. Spoon remaining mascarpone mixture over, and dust with 1 tablespoon cocoa powder. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 6 hours.
6. Remove tiramisu from the refrigerator and leave at room temperature for 20 minutes.
7. Meanwhile, stir sugar and cold water together in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook, without stirring, until sugar has turned a deep amber hue, 10 to 12 minutes.
8. Warm cream in a small saucepan over medium-low heat, 3 to 4 minutes. Whisk cream slowly into the caramel and let simmer over medium-low heat until smooth, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat. Whisk in butter, followed by salt.
9. Dust tiramisu with remaining cocoa powder and serve with warm caramel sauce.
