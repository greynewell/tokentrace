## Ingredients

- 1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs, quartered
- ½  yellow onion, grated
- 4 cloves garlic, minced

## Instructions

1. Stir chicken, onion, garlic, fine salt, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper together in a bowl until chicken is coated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 4 hours to overnight.
