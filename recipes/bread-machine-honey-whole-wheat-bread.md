## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups warm water
- 2 tablespoons butter
- ¼ cup raw honey
- 3 ½ cups whole wheat flour
- ¼ cup flaxseed meal
- ¼ cup vital wheat gluten
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt
- 1 ½ tablespoons dry milk powder
- 2 teaspoons active dry yeast

## Instructions

1. Place warm water, butter, honey, whole wheat flour, flaxseed meal, vital wheat gluten, salt, dry milk, and yeast in a bread machine in the order listed. Run a basic wheat bread cycle, but adjust the cook timer to cut baking time down by 25 to 30 minutes. I time the bread and take it out when I see that it is not yet brown. If you like a crusty bread you may let it cook the entire time.
2. Remove loaf from the machine after the cycle is done.
