## Ingredients

- 1 (2 to 3 pound) whole chicken
- 1 (12 fluid ounce) can beer
- 5 tablespoons poultry seasoning
- 4 dashes liquid smoke flavoring
- 4  bay leaves
- 1 long metal skewer

## Instructions

1. Rinse and dry chicken. Remove excess fat and leave skin on. Lift skin from breast and thigh areas; slide bay leaves under skin. Coat chicken with poultry seasoning.
2. Drink 1/2 of the can of beer; pour liquid smoke into remaining beer. Raise tab on beer can until it is in the straight-up position.
3. Insert beer can into chicken from the bottom until even with bottom of chicken. Insert skewer through wing, ribs, beer can tab, and out the opposite side. (This keeps the can from falling out of chicken.)
4. Preheat the grill by lighting the coals. Spread the coals to form a ring around the outside edge of the grill.
5. Place chicken in the center, standing up on the can to cook. Close grill; cook for 2 hours. A meat thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
6. Remove chicken carefully from the grill so as not to spill the contents of the can. Remove skewer and beer can; let chicken sit for 15 minutes before cutting.
