## Ingredients

- 2 cloves garlic, crushed
- 1 cup dry white wine
- ¼ cup sherry
- 1 pound Brie cheese, rind removed and cubed
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 1 pinch freshly grated nutmeg
- salt and white pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Rub the garlic all over the inside of your fondue pot, leaving the crushed pieces in the bottom.
2. You can also make fondue in a regular sauce pan and transfer to the fondue pot, but why get two pans all crazy cheesy? Add the white wine and sherry to the pot and heat over medium-low heat.
3. Toss the cheese cubes in cornstarch to coat.
4. When the wine is hot, add the cheese.
5. Stir slowly with a wooden spoon at first and then use a whisk.
6. Stir constantly to keep it from scorching on the bottom of the pot.
7. When the cheese has melted, remove it from the heat and grate in a little nutmeg.
8. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
9. The fondue should be smooth and coat a wooden spoon.
10. If it seems to runny, add more cheese.
11. If it is too thick, add a splash more wine --sparingly.
12. Prepare your fondue pot base and keep fondue warm over low heat.
13. Get out the good linen napkins and set the table.
14. This is a meal to be proud of!
