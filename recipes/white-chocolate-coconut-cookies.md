## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- ½ cup butter, softened
- 6 tablespoons brown sugar
- 6 tablespoons white sugar
- 1 large egg, beaten
- 1  fresh lime
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 cup white chocolate chips
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- 1 pinch salt
- 2 cups finely shredded coconut, divided, or more to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly spray 2 cookie sheets.
2. Combine butter, sugars, and egg in a bowl using a wooden spoon, not an electric mixer. Grate lime zest into the mixture. Stir in 1/2 to 3/4 teaspoon lime juice.
3. Combine flour, white chocolate chips, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl. Mix in butter mixture until a stiff dough forms. Fold in 1 cup coconut.
4. Place remaining coconut on a flat dish. Roll dough into ping pong ball-sized balls; roll in coconut. Arrange dough on the prepared cookie sheets; do not press down.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned around the edges, about 10 minutes.
