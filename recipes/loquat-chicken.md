## Ingredients

- 6 large ripe loquats, peeled and pitted
- ½ cup water
- ½ cup orange juice
- ⅓ cup brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon ground ginger
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon lemon pepper
- ½ teaspoon smoked paprika
- ¼ cup vinegar
- 1 tablespoon grapeseed oil
- 2  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves

## Instructions

1. Place loquats into a saucepan and stir in water, orange juice, and brown sugar until sugar is dissolved. Bring mixture to a boil.
2. Stir in ground ginger, cinnamon, lemon pepper, and smoked paprika; reduce heat to low. Simmer until sauce has thickened and loquats soften and begin to break apart, about 20 minutes, occasionally whisking vigorously to help break up fruit.
3. Stir in vinegar and simmer for 3 more minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.
4. Heat grapeseed oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook chicken breasts in hot oil until golden brown and no longer pink in the center, 5 to 8 minutes per side. Remove chicken breasts from the skillet and cut them into bite-sized pieces.
5. Return chicken pieces to the skillet and stir in 1/4 of the loquat sauce, scraping and dissolving any browned bits of food into sauce. Serve chicken with remaining loquat sauce on the side.
