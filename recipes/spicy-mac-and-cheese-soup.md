## Ingredients

- 2 (7.25 ounce) packages macaroni and cheese mix
- ¼ cup butter
- 2 cups chicken broth
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers
- 1 tablespoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon dry mustard powder
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste
- 1 ½ cups milk
- ¾ cup sour cream, divided

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil and stir in macaroni from the packages, retaining cheese mix packets for later use. Cook macaroni at a rolling boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until tender but still slightly firm, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and rinse macaroni with cold water. Return cooked macaroni to the pot.
2. Mix butter, chicken broth, and tomatoes with macaroni and bring mixture to a simmer over medium heat; stir in garlic powder, cumin, dry mustard, pepper, and contents of cheese mix packets. Stir in milk and reduce heat to low; heat soup almost to a simmer. Do not boil.
3. Serve soup in bowls and top each serving with about 2 tablespoons of sour cream.
