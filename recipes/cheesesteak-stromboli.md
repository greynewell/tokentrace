## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 1 (21 ounce) package frozen beef sandwich steaks
- 1 small onion, diced
- 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 (13.8 ounce) can refrigerated pizza dough (such as Pillsbury®)
- ½ pound American cheese, thinly sliced

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Grease a skillet with cooking spray and set over medium heat. Break up sandwich steaks by hand and add to the skillet; cook and stir until golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain excess grease. Stir in onion, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, salt, and pepper; set aside.
3. Unroll pizza dough onto a flat work surface; stretch into a 12-inch square. Spread a thin layer of beef mixture on one end, leaving a 1-inch border on the sides. Tear 4 slices of American cheese in half and lay on top. Roll up dough, pinching the sides together. Repeat layering and rolling with remaining beef mixture and cheese.
4. Seal top of roll; transfer to an ungreased baking sheet.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until top is golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Let stand for 5 minutes before cutting into 1-inch slices.
