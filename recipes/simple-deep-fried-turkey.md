## Ingredients

- 3 ½ gallons peanut oil for frying
- 1 (10 pound) whole turkey, neck and giblets removed
- 1 tablespoon salt, or to taste
- 1 tablespoon ground black pepper, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a large stockpot or turkey fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Make sure the fryer is located outdoors in a safe area, preferably on dirt or pavement, and far away from buildings, wooden decks, or other objects. Keep a fire extinguisher handy, just in case.
2. Ensure that the turkey is completely thawed. Cut any extra skin away from the neck area and make sure neck hole is at least 1 inch in diameter. Pat the bird completely dry with paper towels, then rub liberally with salt and pepper on both the outside and the inside. Place turkey into a drain basket, neck-side first.
3. Working slowly and carefully, gently lower the basket into the hot oil to completely cover the turkey. Maintain the temperature of the oil at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and cook turkey for 3 1/2 minutes per pound, about 35 minutes.
4. Carefully remove basket from oil, and drain turkey. Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the thigh; the internal temperature must be 180 degrees F (80 degrees C). Allow to rest for 15 minutes before slicing.
