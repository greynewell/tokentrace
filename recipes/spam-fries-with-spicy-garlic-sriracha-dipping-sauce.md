## Ingredients

- 1 clove garlic, minced
- ½ teaspoon paprika
- 1 pinch salt
- 1 cup mayonnaise
- 1 tablespoon sriracha sauce
- 1 tablespoon ketchup
- 1 quart vegetable oil for frying
- 2 (12 ounce) cans fully cooked luncheon meat (such as SPAM®), sliced into fries

## Instructions

1. Process garlic, paprika, and salt in a food processor until smooth. Add mayonnaise, sriracha sauce, and ketchup; process until sauce is well-combined. Transfer sauce to a bowl, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until chilled.
2. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Rinse luncheon meat 'fries' with cool water and pat dry.
3. Working in batches, cook 'fries' in preheated oil until browned and crispy on the outside and still moist on the inside, 4 to 6 minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate. Transfer 'fries' to a plate and serve with chilled dipping sauce.
