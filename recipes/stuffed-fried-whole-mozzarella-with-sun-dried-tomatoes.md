- 4 teaspoons chopped fresh basil

- 2  eggs
- 1 cup panko bread crumbs
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- vegetable oil for frying

## Instructions

1. Cut 1/3 off the top of each mozzarella ball.
2. Scoop out some of the cheese with a teaspoon to make a hole in each ball.
3. Stuff hole with 1 teaspoon basil and 1 teaspoon sun-dried tomatoes; cover with the top.
4. Beat eggs using a fork in a shallow bowl.
5. Pour panko bread crumbs, salt, and pepper into a second shallow bowl.
6. Dip mozzarella balls into beaten eggs, holding them with 2 forks so the top doesn't fall off.
