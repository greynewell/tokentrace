## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups water
- ⅔ cup uncooked brown rice
- ½ pound ground turkey
- ½ cup chopped green bell pepper
- ⅓ cup chopped onion
- ½ teaspoon minced garlic
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon dried celery flakes
- 1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ⅓ cup water
- 1 pinch salt, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Bring 1 1/2 cup of water to a boil in a saucepan, and stir in the brown rice. Reduce the heat to a simmer, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed, 40 to 50 minutes. Set the rice aside.
2. Place ground turkey into a skillet over medium heat, and cook and stir the turkey until the meat gives up some of its fat, 2 to 3 minutes; stir in green bell pepper, onion, and minced garlic. Cook and stir until the turkey is crumbly and no longer pink and the vegetables are tender, 5 to 8 more minutes. Drain excess grease, if necessary. Stir in the cooked brown rice, garlic powder, celery flakes, Cajun seasoning, black pepper, and 1/3 cup water.
3. Bring the mixture to a simmer, and cook until the liquid is absorbed, about 10 minutes. Season to taste with salt and additional black pepper, if desired.
