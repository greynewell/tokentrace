## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 2 pounds bone-in chicken pieces
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 1 small carrot, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- ¾ cup dried lentils
- 1 (14 ounce) can chicken broth
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 (10 ounce) can tomato sauce
- ½ teaspoon dried rosemary
- ½ teaspoon dried basil

## Instructions

1. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat, and cook the chicken pieces 5 minutes on each side, or until juices run clear. Remove chicken from skillet, and set aside.
