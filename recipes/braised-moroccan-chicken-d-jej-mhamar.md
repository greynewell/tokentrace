## Ingredients

- 1 (6.75 ounce) package rice vermicelli
- 2 tablespoons raisins
- 4 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro, divided
- 3 cloves garlic, grated, divided
- 1 teaspoon finely chopped preserved lemon rind
- ¾ teaspoon ground ginger, divided
- 1 dash ground turmeric
- 1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 (2 1/2 to 3 pound) whole chicken
- ¼  preserved lemon
- ¼ cup vegetable oil
- 1  onion, grated
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ¼ teaspoon ground turmeric
- 4 cups water, or as needed
- 4 threads saffron threads, or more to taste
- 1 cup large pitted green olives, rinsed

## Instructions

1. Soak vermicelli noodles in hot water until softened, about 15 minutes. Drain and add raisins, 1 tablespoon cilantro, 1 clove grated garlic, 1 teaspoon chopped preserved lemon, 1/4 teaspoon ginger, 1 dash turmeric, salt, and pepper.
2. Clean the chicken, keeping the skin intact. Stuff with the prepared vermicelli. Tie legs closed with kitchen string. Remove seeds from preserved lemon and cut into 2 or 3 pieces.
3. Heat oil in a stock pot over medium heat. Add grated onion, preserved lemon, remaining 3 tablespoons cilantro, remaining 3 cloves garlic, 1 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, remaining 1/2 teaspoon ginger, cinnamon, and 1/4 teaspoon turmeric. Stir together over medium heat. Add chicken and fry, being sure it doesn't stick and break the skin, about 2 minutes on each side.
4. Add enough water that the chicken is about half immersed. Add saffron. Cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center, 30 to 40 minutes, checking water level occasionally. Add olives about 15 minutes before the chicken is finished. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove the chicken to a plate and reduce the sauce until it is thick, 10 to 15 minutes.
5. Pat the chicken dry and remove kitchen string; place in a baking dish. Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
6. Broil chicken in the preheated oven, turning as needed, until skin is darkened and crisp, about 5 minutes total.
7. Spread the sauce on a platter and place chicken on top.
