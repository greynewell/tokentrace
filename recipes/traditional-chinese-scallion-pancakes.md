## Ingredients

- ½ cup warm water
- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- 1 teaspoon yeast
- 2 cups sifted all-purpose flour, divided
- ½ cup hot water
- 2 ½ tablespoons vegetable oil, divided, or as needed
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or as needed
- 1 cup finely chopped scallions

## Instructions

1. Combine warm water, sugar, and yeast in a bowl. Add 1 cup flour; stir dough with a spatula.
2. Mix the remaining 1 cup flour, hot water, 2 tablespoons oil, and salt together in a separate bowl until dough-like in texture. Add the dough from step 1; knead together into a round ball, dusting with flour as needed. Place dough ball on a lightly floured work surface; cover with a warm, damp towel for 30 to 40 minutes.
3. Pinch dough ball into 2 pieces. Roll each out and sprinkle half the scallions on top. Roll up each piece into a tube; pinch each in half. Roll and flatten into large pancakes, dusting with flour, if needed.
4. Heat the remaining oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook pancakes until browned, 3 to 4 minutes per side.
