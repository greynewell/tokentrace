## Ingredients

- 2 (5 ounce) boneless chicken breasts, cut into strips
- ½ cup mojo criollo marinade (such as Goya®)
- 2 teaspoons Cajun seasoning
- wooden skewers

## Instructions

1. Combine chicken strips, marinade, and Cajun seasoning in a resealable plastic bag. Refrigerate for 8 hours to overnight.
2. Measure skewers to fit across the air fryer basket, slightly overlapping the edge. Trim off excess length.
3. Preheat the air fryer to 180 degrees F (80 degrees C) for 10 minutes.
4. Thread chicken strips onto skewers, leaving room in between each strip, while the air fryer is preheating.
5. Air fry for 1 hour 15 minutes. Adjust cooking time as most air fryers have a maximum setting of 30 minutes. Rearrange the skewers during the reset time.
6. Increase temperature to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C) and air fry for an additional 15 minutes.
7. Remove strips to a paper towel-lined storage container. Seal. Allow to rest overnight before serving.
