## Ingredients

- 3 teaspoons cornstarch
- 3 teaspoons water
- 1 (14 ounce) can chicken broth
- ½ cup dry white wine
- ¼ cup salted butter
- 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
- 2 teaspoons chopped fresh parsley
- 1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 (8 ounce) package linguine pasta
- 1 pound jumbo shrimp, peeled and deveined
- ½ cup all-purpose flour
- 3 large eggs, beaten
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Combine cornstarch and water in a small bowl. Bring chicken broth, wine, butter, lemon juice, parsley, salt, and pepper to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Add the water and cornstarch mixture, 1 teaspoon at a time, until sauce thickens slightly. Remove from heat.
2. While sauce is heating, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain and keep warm.
3. Coat shrimp with flour, then with beaten egg.
4. Heat oil in a large skillet set over medium-high heat. Pan-fry shrimp in the hot oil until opaque, 2 to 3 minutes on each side, working in batches if needed.
5. Add cooked shrimp to the finished sauce. Place a serving of pasta on each plate; add about 5 shrimp and a few spoonfuls of sauce over top.
