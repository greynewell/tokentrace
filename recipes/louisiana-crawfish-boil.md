## Ingredients

- 2 heads   garlic, unpeeled
- 5  bay leaves
- 2 (3 ounce) packages dry crab boil
- 1 tablespoon liquid shrimp and crab boil seasoning
- salt and pepper to taste
- 3 large  oranges, halved
- 3 large lemons, halved
- 2 large whole artichokes
- 15  red potatoes, washed
- 30 pieces baby corn
- 2 large onions, sliced
- 2 (16 ounce) packages mushrooms, cleaned
- ½ pound fresh green beans, trimmed
- 2 (16 ounce) packages smoked sausage, cut into 1/2 inch slices
- 50  live crawfish, rinsed

## Instructions

1. Fill a very large pot about 1/3 full with water. Add in garlic, bay leaves, dry and liquid crab boil seasonings, salt, pepper, potatoes, oranges, lemons, and artichokes. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce to a simmer, and cook for 20 minutes.
2. Stir in mushrooms, green beans, onions, and baby corn, and continue to cook, about 15 minutes. Stir in sausage; cook 5 minutes more.
3. Add crawfish and return the mixture to a boil, then simmer until crawfish shells turn bright red and the tails pull out easily, about 5 minutes. Test for doneness by peeling a crawfish. Be sure not to overcook, or crawfish will become tough.
4. Remove from the heat and carefully drain all liquid. Serve the crawfish boil hot, Louisiana-style, spread over a picnic table covered with newspapers.
