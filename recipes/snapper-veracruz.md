## Ingredients

- ¼ cup olive oil
- 1 small green bell pepper, chopped
- 1  onion, chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- ¼ teaspoon ground white pepper
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1  lime, juiced
- ½ cup pimento-stuffed green olives, sliced
- ¼ cup canned diced green chiles, drained
- 3 large tomatoes, seeded and coarsely chopped
- 4 (8 ounce) fillets red snapper
- 1 tablespoon capers, rinsed and drained

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add green pepper, onion, and garlic, and cook until pepper is soft, about 5 minutes. Mix in the white pepper, cinnamon, lime juice, olives, and chiles; cook for 2 more minutes, to blend the flavors. Stir in the tomatoes, and cook until thickened, about 10 minutes.
2. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place the snapper filets into a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Pour the tomato sauce over the filets, and bake for 10 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until fish flakes easily with a fork. Stir in the capers just before serving.
