## Ingredients

- 1 cup butter
- ½ cup packed brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 3 cups quick cooking oats
- 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
- ½ cup peanut butter

## Instructions

1. Grease a 9-inch square pan.
2. Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in brown sugar and vanilla; mix in oats. Cook over low heat until ingredients are well blended, about 2 to 3 minutes. Press 1/2 of the mixture into the bottom of the prepared pan. Reserve remaining oat mixture for topping.
