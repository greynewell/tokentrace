## Ingredients

- 2 teaspoons lemon-pepper seasoning
- ½ teaspoon dried oregano
- ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons avocado oil, or as needed
- 4 (7 ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breasts

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Combine lemon-pepper, oregano, and pepper in a small bowl; pour onto a plate.
3. Pour 1 to 2 tablespoons avocado oil into the bottom of a skillet, just enough to cover the bottom, and heat over medium-high heat until it shimmers.
4. Dredge both sides of the chicken in the seasoning and place into the shimmering oil. Sear until golden, about 3 minutes on each side. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 12 to 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
