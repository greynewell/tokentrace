## Ingredients

- 1  refrigerated pie crust (such as Pillsbury®)
- 4 extra large eggs
- 2 small lemons, juiced
- 2 cups white sugar
- ½ cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
- ½ cup whole milk
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons corn muffin mix (such as Jiffy®)
- ¼ teaspoon salt

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Let pie crust come to room temperature for 10 minutes.
3. Unroll crust gently onto a floured surface. Use a rolling pin to gently flatten and smooth out the crust; do not press too hard. Gently transfer crust into a 9x5/8-inch glass deep-dish pie plate. Make sure the crust is sitting flat on the bottom of the plate. Gently form the sides and pinch the top edge to form the crust; do not stretch. Place in a refrigerator.
4. Beat eggs and lemon juice with an electric mixer until fluffy. Mix sugar and butter together in another bowl until creamy. Add to egg mixture and beat until mixed, for 1 minute. Add milk, flour, corn muffin mix, and salt; beat until just blended. Pour into the prepared pie crust.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until center is slightly browned, set, and does not wiggle, 50 to 60 minutes. Place on a wire rack until completely cool, 20 to 30 minutes. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours.
