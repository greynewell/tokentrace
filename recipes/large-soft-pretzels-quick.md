## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups warm water
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 5 teaspoons active dry yeast
- 4 cups all-purpose flour
- ¼ cup melted butter
- 1 teaspoon coarse salt
- 1  egg, beaten
- coarse salt to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Mix water and sugar together in a bowl until sugar is dissolved; add yeast. Let mixture stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.
3. Whisk flour, butter, and salt together in a bowl until well mixed; add yeast mixture and stir with a fork until dough starts to cling. Turn dough onto a floured work surface and knead until smooth.
4. Cut dough into 15 equal pieces and roll each piece between your hands into rope shapes at least the thickness of a pencil. Twist dough into desired shapes and arrange on a baking sheet; brush with egg and sprinkle coarse salt over each.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until pretzels are browned and cooked through, 8 to 12 minutes.
