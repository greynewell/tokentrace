## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- ½ cup cornmeal
- ⅓ cup white sugar
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ⅓ cup butter, chilled
- ¾ cup craisins (sweetened, dried cranberries)
- ⅔ cup eggnog

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.
2. Stir the flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a mixing bowl until blended. Cut in the butter using a pastry cutter or two knives until coarse crumbs form. Mix in the craisins. Use a fork to stir in the eggnog and make a sticky dough.
3. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface; dip hands in flour and knead the dough about 10 times. Pat the dough out into a disk about 1/2 inch thick. Dip a 2 inch diameter biscuit cutter into some flour, and cut out 8 to 10 rounds. Place rounds about 2 inches apart on prepared baking sheet. Use up remaining dough by patting it into a smaller disk and cutting again.
4. Bake in preheated oven until risen and golden brown, about 15 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.
