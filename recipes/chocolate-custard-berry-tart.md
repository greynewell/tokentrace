## Ingredients

- 1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
- ½ cup butter
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 2 tablespoons water
- 1 (4 ounce) bar milk chocolate
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
- ½ cup white sugar
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1  egg
- ½ cup fresh blueberries
- ½ cup fresh raspberries
- ½ cup fresh blackberries
- ½ cup sliced fresh strawberries
- 2 tablespoons raspberry syrup
- 2 teaspoons blackberry liqueur

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Blend flour, butter, and sugar together in a food processor until crumbly. Pour in water; mix until crust dough holds together. Press into the bottom and sides of a 9-inch tart pan. Poke holes in dough with a fork to eliminate air bubbles.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Remove from oven; increase oven temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
4. Chop chocolate and place in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave in 15-second intervals, stirring occasionally, until melted; spread over baked crust.
5. Beat cream cheese, sugar, flour, vanilla extract, and egg together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth; spread filling over chocolate layer.
6. Arrange berries tightly and evenly over cream cheese filling. Mix raspberry syrup and blackberry schnapps together in a small bowl; brush over berries using a pastry brush.
7. Bake in the preheated oven until berries are reduced and filling begins to set, about 35 minutes. Remove from oven; filling will set completely as it cools.
