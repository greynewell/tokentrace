## Ingredients

- 2 cups smooth peanut butter
- ½ cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 3 ½ cups confectioners' sugar
- 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal®)
- 3 cups crispy rice cereal (such as Rice Krispies®)
- 3 cups milk chocolate chips
- 3 tablespoons vegetable shortening
- ½ teaspoon flaky sea salt, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Line 2 cookie sheets with parchment paper.
2. Beat peanut butter and butter together in the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment on medium speed until smooth. Add confectioners' sugar and beat until smooth. Add vanilla extract and kosher salt and beat until combined. Add rice cereal and mix on low to combine; mixture will be quite thick.
3. Roll the mixture into 1 1/2-inch balls and place on one of the prepared sheets. Place in the freezer briefly while you make the chocolate coating.
4. Melt chocolate chips and shortening in a microwave-safe bowl in a microwave on high power in 20-second bursts, mixing after each.
5. Dip the cereal balls in the melted chocolate and place on the clean parchment-lined pan. You can use two forks to help you cover the balls in chocolate and move them to the prepared pan. Sprinkle with sea salt.
6. Let them set up, about 40 minutes.
