## Ingredients

- 1 large head broccoli, cut into florets
- 6 tablespoons butter, divided
- ½ cup all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ cups milk
- 1 ½ cups shredded Cheddar cheese
- ½ teaspoon salt, or to taste
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 pinch garlic powder
- 1 pinch onion powder
- 2 slices stale bread

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add broccoli, cover, and steam until tender, 3 to 5 minutes.
3. Melt 5 tablespoons butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Add flour, stirring constantly to prevent browning. Slowly pour in milk, stirring constantly. Remove from heat; stir in Cheddar cheese, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder.
4. Drain broccoli and place in a casserole dish. Pour cheese sauce on top.
5. Bake in the preheated oven for about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, crush bread into crumbs. Saute in a skillet with the remaining 1 tablespoon butter until golden, 2 to 3 minutes.
6. Spread bread crumbs over the broccoli and continue baking until golden brown, about 5 minutes more.
