- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2  yellow onions, diced
- 2  carrots, diced
- ¼ cup butter
- 1  zucchini, diced
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle beer (golden ale-style)
- 3 tablespoons seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®)
- 3 tablespoons dried parsley
- 1 tablespoon garlic powder

## Instructions

1. Heat olive oil in a large soup pot over medium heat; cook and stir onions and carrots until onions are slightly softened, about 2 minutes. Melt butter with onions and carrots; cook and stir zucchini and garlic in the melted butter until onions are translucent, about 7 more minutes.
