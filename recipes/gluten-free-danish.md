## Ingredients

- 2 cups gluten-free pancake mix
- ¼ cup butter, room temperature
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- ⅔ cup milk
- ½ teaspoon almond extract
- ¼ cup raspberry jam
- ⅔ cup confectioners' sugar
- 2 tablespoons milk, or more as needed
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- ¼ teaspoon almond extract

## Instructions

1. Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Combine the pancake mix, butter, and sugar; mix until crumbly. Stir in 2/3 cup milk and 1/2 teaspoon almond extract and mix until fully incorporated. The dough will be sticky.
3. Drop the dough by rounded tablespoons onto the baking sheet, spacing the dough about 2 inches apart. With the back of a teaspoon, make a shallow indentation in the center of each dough ball. Fill the centers with a teaspoon of jam.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Allow the pastries to cool.
5. Combine the confectioners' sugar, 3 tablespoons of milk, vanilla extract, and 1/4 teaspoon almond extract and mix until smooth. Drizzle the glaze over the Danish.
