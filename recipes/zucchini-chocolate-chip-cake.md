## Ingredients

- 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- ¼ cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon baking powder
- ½ cup milk
- 1 teaspoon distilled white vinegar
- ½ cup butter, softened
- 1 ½ cups white sugar
- ½ cup vegetable oil
- 2  eggs
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 2 cups grated zucchini

## Instructions

1. Preheat an oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch pan. Combine flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and baking powder in a bowl.
