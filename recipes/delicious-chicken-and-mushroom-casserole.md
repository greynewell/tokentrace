## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 ½ pounds boneless chicken breast, cut into strips
- 8 ounces cremini mushrooms, sliced
- 5 ounces oyster mushrooms, stemmed and sliced
- 4 ounces shiitake mushrooms, stemmed and sliced
- 1 clove garlic, finely chopped
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- ½ cup white wine
- 2 cups chicken stock
- ½ teaspoon ground sage
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ¼ cup heavy whipping cream
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
