## Ingredients

- 6 slices bacon
- 4  fresh tomatillos, husks removed
- 3  serrano chile peppers, seeded and chopped
- 1 clove garlic, peeled
- 3 cups water
- 2 pounds flank steak, cut into 1/2-inch squares
- 1 cube chicken bouillon
- 2 (15.5 ounce) cans pinto beans
- ½  onion, chopped
- 6 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
- ground black pepper, to taste
- 1  lime, cut into 6 wedges

## Instructions

1. Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Crumble bacon and set aside.
2. Combine water, tomatillos, serrano peppers, and garlic in a small saucepan over medium-high heat; bring to a boil, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool. Transfer contents to a blender; blend until smooth and set aside. (You can skip the simmering step and blend raw tomatillos, peppers, and garlic with water and a few pieces of browned flank steak if you like.)
3. Place a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir flank steak in the hot skillet until completely browned. Pour tomatillo mixture over beef and bring to a boil. Stir in chicken bouillon and reduce heat to medium. Cover the skillet and simmer until tender, 30 minutes to 1 hour.
4. Meanwhile, heat pinto beans in a saucepan over medium heat until warm; reduce heat to low to keep warm until needed.
5. Stir bacon and pinto beans into flank steak mixture; divide mixture between 6 bowls. Garnish each with onion, cilantro, black pepper, and a lime wedge.
