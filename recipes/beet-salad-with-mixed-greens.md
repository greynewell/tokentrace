## Ingredients

- 1 bunch red beets, trimmed and washed
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
- sea salt and cracked black pepper to taste
- 2 cups chopped fresh mustard greens
- 2 cups chopped beet greens
- 2 cups chopped romaine lettuce
- 1 medium grapefruit, segmented
- ¼ cup chopped red onion, or to taste
- ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice, or to taste
- 2 tablespoons crumbled goat cheese, or to taste
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place a sheet pan on the lower oven rack.
2. Place beets on a sheet of aluminum foil. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon oil. Fold edges of the foil around the beets to make a sealed pouch.
3. Place pouch on the center rack of the oven, so the sheet pan below can catch any drippings. Roast until beets are tender when pierced with a knife, 50 to 60 minutes. Remove beets from the oven. Open the pouch and allow to cool.
4. Rub a paper towel on the cooled beets to remove skin. Cut into small pieces. Drizzle with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Set aside.
5. Chop grapefruit segments. Transfer fruit and any accumulated juices into a small bowl.
6. Combine mustard greens, beet greens, romaine lettuce, chopped grapefruit and juice, red onion, 1/4 cup olive oil, garlic, and lemon juice in a large bowl; mix well. Season with salt and pepper.
7. Divide greens among 6 salad bowls. Top with roasted beets and garnish with goat cheese and dill.
