## Ingredients

- 12  baby red or white potatoes, halved
- 1 (8 ounce) package baby carrots
- 1 cup broccoli florets
- 1 tablespoon butter, at room temperature
- 4 (5 ounce) salmon fillets
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ¾ cup chicken stock
- ½  lemon, juiced
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill
- 1  garlic clove, chopped

## Instructions

1. Place potatoes and carrots in a large pot. Cover with a generous amount of cold water. Bring to a boil; cook until tender yet still firm, about 5 minutes. Add broccoli and cook for 2 minutes more. Drain vegetables well. Rinse under cold running water and drain well again.
2. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Butter a 9x13-inch baking pan.
3. Place salmon fillets in the baking pan. Surround salmon with parboiled vegetables; season with salt and pepper. Combine chicken stock, lemon juice, dill, and garlic in a bowl. Drizzle over the salmon and vegetables. Cover with aluminum foil.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until salmon fillets flake easily with a fork, about 15 minutes.
