## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups chicken stock, divided
- 1 teaspoon finely chopped onion
- 1 clove garlic, finely chopped
- ½ cup milk
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon chopped fresh parsley
- ⅛ teaspoon lemon pepper seasoning
- 1 pinch ground allspice
- 1 pinch ground paprika
- 1 cup milk
- ¾ cup all-purpose flour

## Instructions

1. Place 1 tablespoon of chicken stock in a saucepan over medium-low heat, and cook and stir the onion and garlic in the broth until they are softened, about 3 minutes. Pour in the rest of the broth and 1/2 cup of milk, and whisk in the salt, black pepper, parsley, lemon pepper seasoning, allspice, and paprika. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat, and allow to simmer for 1 to 2 minutes.
