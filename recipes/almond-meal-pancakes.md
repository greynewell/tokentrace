## Ingredients

- 2 large eggs
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 tablespoons maple syrup
- ¾ teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 pinch salt
- 1 cup finely ground almond meal
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon butter, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Combine eggs, olive oil, maple syrup, vanilla extract, salt, almond meal, and baking powder in a bowl. Whisk until thoroughly combined. Let batter sit for 10 minutes to marry the flavors and activate the baking powder.
2. Butter a nonstick pan or griddle over medium heat. Scoop in batter into any size pancake(s) you like. Cook until edges are set and bottom is golden brown, 2 or 3 minutes. Flip and cook until slightly springy to the touch, another 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
