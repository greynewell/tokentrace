## Ingredients

- olive oil
- 2 medium onions, halved and sliced
- 1 teaspoon dried marjoram
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 2  lemons, sliced
- 5 pods whole star anise pods
- ⅓ cup water
- aluminum foil
- 1 (1 1/2-pound) salmon fillet

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat and cook onions until soft and browned, about 10 minutes. Season with marjoram and a little salt. Remove from heat.
3. Place lemon slices in a single layer in a clean skillet over high heat and cook until lightly browned on both sides, about 3 minutes. Add star anise and water and bring to a boil. Remove from heat.
4. Cover a baking pan large enough to hold the salmon with sheets of aluminum foil, leaving an overhang on all sides. Lay onions in a single layer on the bottom; place salmon fillet on top, skin-side down. Rub fillet with salt and pepper. Cover with lemon slices and star anise. Fold up the edges of the foil over the salmon to create a packet, making sure to seal the edges well.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until salmon flakes easily with a fork, 35 to 40 minutes. Remove from oven, open foil carefully, and serve.
