## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- 4 tablespoons dry ranch seasoning, divided
- 1  egg
- 6 ounces ranch-flavored tortilla chips (such as Doritos® Cool Ranch®)
- 2 tablespoons panko bread crumbs
- 4 (4 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken thighs

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray with cooking spray.
2. Mix flour and 2 tablespoons ranch seasoning in a shallow bowl. Beat egg in a second shallow bowl.
3. Crush ranch-flavored tortilla chips in a food processor or Vitamix® until they are fine crumbs. Combine crushed tortilla chips, remaining 2 tablespoons dry ranch seasoning, and panko bread crumbs in a third shallow bowl.
4. Dip each chicken thigh first in flour mixture, then in egg, and finally in tortilla chip mixture. Place on the prepared baking sheet.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 35 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
