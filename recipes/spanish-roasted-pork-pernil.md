## Ingredients

- 9 pounds skin-on, bone-in pork shoulder (picnic) roast
- 1  lime, halved
- 10 cloves garlic
- 2 ½ tablespoons salt
- 1 ½ tablespoons olive oil, divided
- 1 tablespoon dried oregano
- 1 ½ teaspoons ground black pepper
- 1 ¼ teaspoons adobo seasoning (such as Goya®)
- 1 teaspoon vinegar
- ¼ teaspoon sazon seasoning
- 2 (12 fluid ounce) cans or bottles beer (such as Budweiser®)

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
2. Rub pork shoulder all over with lime.
3. Mash garlic into paste in a mortar and pestle or pilon. Transfer to a bowl; mix in salt, 1 tablespoon oil, oregano, black pepper, adobo seasoning, and vinegar.
4. Lift skin off the pork to 1-inch from the narrow part of the bone. Make 3/4-inch slits all over the pork with a sharp knife. Stuff seasoned garlic paste into the slits. Pull skin back over to cover the pork.
5. Mix remaining 1/2 teaspoon oil and sazon seasoning together in a small bowl. Rub over the skin of the pork.
6. Transfer pork to a large roasting pan. Pour in beer. Cover with aluminum foil, sealing well.
7. Roast in the preheated oven until slightly pink in the center, about 3 hours.
8. Increase oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Uncover pork and continue roasting until skin is golden brown and crispy, about 2 1/2 hours. Remove from oven and let stand for 10 minutes before carving.
