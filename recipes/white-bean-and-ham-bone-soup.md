## Ingredients

- 1  ham bone with meat
- 4 quarts water
- 1 pound dry great Northern beans
- 2 cups diced fully cooked ham
- 1 cup diced celery
- 1 cup diced carrots
- 1 cup diced onion
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 4 tablespoons dry sherry  (Optional)
- salt and pepper to taste
- ¼ cup minced fresh parsley  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Combine ham bone and 4 quarts of water in a large stock pot of Dutch oven at least the night before. Bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat and simmer for 10 to 12 hours.
2. In the meantime, place beans in a large pot with water to cover; soak overnight. Drain beans the next day and return to the pot.
3. Remove ham bone from the pot and pick off any edible meat. Strain the stock and measure out 3 quarts for the soup. Remaining stock can be frozen.
4. Pour 3 quarts of stock over the soaked beans. Add ham, celery, carrots, onion, and garlic. Season with salt and pepper. Bring soup to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer. Cover, tilting the lid to allow steam to escape, and simmer until beans are tender, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Add sherry in the last 30 minutes of cooking and season with salt and pepper.
5. Ladle soup into bowls and sprinkle with fresh parsley.
