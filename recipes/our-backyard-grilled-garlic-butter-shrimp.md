## Ingredients

- 1 small bunch fresh Italian parsley, stemmed and roughly chopped
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 pound fresh medium shrimp - shells on, rinsed, and patted dry
- bamboo skewers
- 1 tablespoon seasoned salt (such as Lawry's®), or to taste
- ½ cup salted butter
- 3 cloves garlic, minced

## Instructions

1. Place parsley and olive oil into a resealable plastic bag. Add shrimp, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours. Soak skewers in water during the last 30 minutes or so.
2. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
3. Remove shrimp from the marinade and thread onto skewers. Season generously with seasoned salt. Place parsley and remaining marinade in a grill-safe pan with butter and garlic.
4. Grill skewers until shrimp are pink and firm, about 3 minutes per side. In the meantime, place the grill pan on the grate; melt and simmer the butter-parsley mixture until butter is just golden-brown, 4 to 5 minutes.
5. Remove shrimp from skewers and drop into the butter-parsley mixture. Toss to coat. Serve immediately.
