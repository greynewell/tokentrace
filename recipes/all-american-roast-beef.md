## Ingredients

- 3 pounds beef eye of round roast
- ½ teaspoon kosher salt
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Make sure roast is at room temperature. Tie roast at 3-inch intervals with cotton twine; this helps it from drying out and allows it to cook more evenly. Place roast on a rack in a baking pan.
3. Mix together salt, garlic powder, and pepper in a small bowl. Rub seasoning mixture into the meat.
4. Place in the preheated oven and roast for 60 minutes, or 20 minutes per pound if your roast is larger or smaller. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 120 to 125 degrees F (49 to 52 degrees C).
5. Remove from the oven and transfer to a cutting board. Cover loosely with foil, and let rest so juices can redistribute, 15 to 20 minutes.
6. Slice and serve.
