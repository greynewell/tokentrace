## Ingredients

- 3 (4 ounce) flounder fillets
- ½ cup cayenne pepper sauce (such as Frank's® RedHot®)
- 1 cup corn flour
- 3 tablespoons butter
- 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 6 tablespoons chunky blue cheese dressing

## Instructions

1. Place flounder and cayenne pepper sauce in a large resealable plastic bag.
2. Let marinate in the refrigerator, at least 1 hour.
3. Place corn flour in a shallow pan.
4. Remove fillets, reserving marinade in the bag, and carefully dredge in the corn flour one at a time, coating completely and transferring to a plate.
5. Dip each coated fillet back into the marinade, dredge again in corn flour, and dip in the marinade again.
6. Repeat with remaining fillets.
7. Heat butter and olive in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until sizzling.
8. Arrange fillets in the skillet so they are not touching and cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes.
