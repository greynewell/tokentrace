## Ingredients

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 cup milk
- 1  egg
- 1 pinch salt

## Instructions

1. In a medium-size mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, milk, egg and salt.
2. Heat a large frying pan or wok over medium high heat. When the pan is hot add a teaspoon of butter and lightly coat the surface of the pan with the melted butter.
3. Pour one quarter cup of the batter into the pan and tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface in a smooth and even layer.
4. After two minutes, lift up an edge of the crepe with a spatula to see if it is browning. When the underside has begun to brown, flip the crepe and cook the other side until it is also brown; about 2 minutes.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 to cook the remaining crepes. Serve hot.
