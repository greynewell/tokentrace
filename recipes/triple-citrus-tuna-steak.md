## Ingredients

- 2 medium oranges, juiced
- 1 medium lime, juiced
- 1 medium lemon, juiced
- ¼ cup diced red onion
- 2 tablespoons minced habanero pepper
- 1 teaspoon cider vinegar
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic
- 1 pinch dried oregano
- ½ cup cubed mango
- ¼ cup diced red onion
- 1 tablespoon minced fresh cilantro
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 2 (4 ounce) tuna steaks
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 5 ounces kettle-cooked potato chips
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 tablespoon sweet chili sauce
- 1 cup hot cooked jasmine rice

## Instructions

1. Prepare marinade: Whisk orange juice, lime juice, lemon juice, red onion, habanero pepper, vinegar, garlic, and oregano together in a bowl large enough to hold the tuna steaks.
2. Prepare salsa: Combine mango, red onion, cilantro, salt, and pepper in a separate bowl. Set aside.
3. Prepare tuna: Sprinkle tuna with salt and pepper. Place in the bowl with the marinade and turn to coat. Marinate for about 30 minutes.
4. While tuna is marinating, crush potato chips as fine as possible in a blender. Transfer to a bowl.
5. Remove tuna from the marinade and press into the crushed chips until both sides are well coated.
6. Heat heavy-bottomed nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add butter and heat until butter melts and foam subsides. Add tuna and sear for 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Remove from the skillet.
7. To serve, top tuna with chile sauce and serve with jasmine rice and mango salsa.
