## Ingredients

- 1 (16 ounce) package frozen unsweetened strawberries, thawed
- 1 (15.25 ounce) package white cake mix
- 1 (6 ounce) package strawberry-flavored gelatin mix
- 4 large eggs
- ½ cup vegetable oil
- ¼ cup water
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- ½ cup unsalted butter, softened
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 4 ¼ cups powdered sugar

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 9-inch round pans.
2. Muddle thawed strawberries in a bowl. Reserve 1/4 cup for frosting.
3. Mix white cake mix and gelatin mix together in a bowl. Add strawberries, eggs, oil, and water and beat until well combined. Divide batter evenly between the prepared cake pans.
