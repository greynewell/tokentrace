## Ingredients

- canola oil cooking spray
- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ¾ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground ginger
- ¼ teaspoon ground cloves
- ¼ teaspoon ground allspice
- 1 cup white sugar
- ¼ cup packed brown sugar
- 4  eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ¾ cup pumpkin puree
- ¾ cup coconut oil
- ¼ cup sliced almonds
- ¼ cup confectioners' sugar

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Spray 36 mini muffin cups with cooking spray or line with paper liners.
2. Whisk flour, baking soda, cinnamon, baking powder, salt, ginger, cloves, and allspice together in a bowl. Beat white sugar, brown sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl using an electric mixer until well blended; beat in pumpkin and coconut oil until just combined.
3. Stir flour mixture into pumpkin mixture until batter is well mixed. Pour batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling 1/4-inch from the top; sprinkle with almond slices.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the middle of a muffin comes out clean, about 11 minutes. Cool muffins in the pans for 2 minutes before transferring to a wire rack. Cool muffins for 5 minutes on rack; sift confectioners' sugar over muffins.
