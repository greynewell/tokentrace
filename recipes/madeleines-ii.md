## Ingredients

- 2  eggs
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- ½ teaspoon lemon zest
- 1 cup confectioners' sugar
- ¾ cup all-purpose flour
- ¼ teaspoon baking powder
- ½ cup butter, melted and cooled

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease and flour 24 3-inch madeleine molds.
2. Beat eggs, vanilla, and lemon zest in a medium bowl with an electric mixer on high speed for 5 minutes. Gradually beat in confectioners' sugar. Beat for 5 to 7 minutes or until thick and satiny.
3. Sift together flour and baking powder. Sift 1/4 of the flour mixture over the egg mixture, gently fold in. Fold in the remaining flour by fourths. Then fold in the melted and cooled butter. Spoon batter into the prepared molds, filling 3/4 full.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are golden and the tops spring back, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool in molds on a rack for 1 minute. Loosen cookies with a knife. Invert cookies onto a rack and cool.
5. Sift confectioners' sugar over the tops or melt semi-sweet chocolate chips and dip the tips in the chocolate. Store in an airtight container.
