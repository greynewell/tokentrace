## Ingredients

- 5 tablespoons butter
- 5 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 small white onion, grated
- 1 stalk celery, grated
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- salt and pepper to taste
- 2 quarts half-and-half cream
- 1 pint heavy cream
- 1 cup chicken broth
- 1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce
- 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill
- 1 pound lump crabmeat
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives
- ½ cup sherry wine

## Instructions

1. Melt butter in a large stockpot over medium heat. Stir in flour to make a smooth paste; cook and stir for about 3 minutes. Mix in onion, celery, and garlic; season with salt and pepper. Continue to cook and stir for about 4 minutes.
2. Gradually whisk in half-and-half so that no lumps form. Stir in heavy cream and chicken broth; bring to a simmer. Pour in 1/2 of the sherry. Season with dill, Worcestershire sauce, and hot sauce. Cover and simmer until soup has reduced by 1/3, about 30 minutes. Add crabmeat; simmer for 10 more minutes.
3. Ladle soup into bowls. Top each serving with a splash of remaining sherry and sprinkle of chives.
