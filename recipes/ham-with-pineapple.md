## Ingredients

- 1 (12 pound)  bone-in ham
- ½ cup whole cloves
- 1 (20 ounce) can pineapple rings in heavy syrup
- ½ cup packed brown sugar
- 1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle lemon-lime flavored carbonated beverage
- 1 (4 ounce) jar chopped maraschino cherries

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (160 degrees C).
2. Place ham in a roasting pan. Use a sharp knife to score ham rind with a diamond pattern. Press a clove into the center of each diamond.
3. Drain juice from pineapple rings into a medium bowl; stir in lemon-lime soda and brown sugar. Coat ham with juice mixture and arrange pineapple rings on ham. Place a maraschino cherry in the center of each pineapple ring and secure with a toothpick.
4. Bake uncovered, basting frequently with pan juices, in the preheated oven until the internal temperature of the ham is 160 degrees F (72 degrees C), 4 to 5 hours. Be sure the meat thermometer does not touch the bone.
5. Remove toothpicks before serving.
