## Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 medium shallot, diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 cup Israeli couscous, uncooked
- 1 ¼ cups chicken stock
- 2  Persian cucumbers, sliced
- 1 cup chopped fresh spinach
- 1 cup grape tomatoes, halved
- 1 cup quartered black olives
- ¼ cup sliced scallions
- ¼ cup chopped fresh Italian parsley
- ¼ cup julienned fresh mint leaves
- ¼ cup julienned fresh basil leaves
- lemon, zested and juiced
- 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- ½ tablespoon Dijon mustard

## Instructions

1. Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add shallot and garlic; cook until soft and fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Add dry couscous and saute until slightly toasted, 2 to 3 minutes.
