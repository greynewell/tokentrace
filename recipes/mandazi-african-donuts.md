## Ingredients

- 1 cup warm milk
- ¼ cup vegetable oil
- ¼ cup fine white sugar
- 1 medium egg
- 2 teaspoons instant yeast
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground cardamom
- 3 ½ cups all-purpose flour, sifted
- vegetable oil for deep frying

## Instructions

1. Combine milk, 1/4 cup vegetable oil, sugar, egg, instant yeast, salt, and cardamom in a large bowl. Mix in flour, 1 cup at a time, until dough comes together and is easily handled. Knead dough on a flat work surface until no longer sticky. Return dough to the bowl; cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
2. Press dough down gently. Knead briefly, then divide dough into 4 equal portions. Roll each portion into a ball; keep covered with a cloth to prevent dough from drying.
3. Roll 1 dough ball into a 1/3-inch-thick circle on a floured work surface. Cut into 4 triangles using a pizza cutter; cover with a cloth. Repeat with remaining dough balls.
4. Heat 2-inches oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan over medium heat.
5. Working in batches, fry dough in hot oil until puffed, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip dough and continue frying until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes more. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.
