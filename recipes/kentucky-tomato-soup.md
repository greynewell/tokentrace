## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons butter
- 1 cup chopped onion
- ½ cup chopped carrots
- 2 stalks celery, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- ¼ cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
- 2 ½ cups chopped fresh tomatoes
- 1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
- ¾ cup strong brewed coffee
- ¼ cup water
- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ground black pepper to taste
- ⅓ cup heavy cream

## Instructions

1. Melt the butter in a stock pot over medium heat. Stir in the onion, carrots, celery, garlic, and parsley; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, tomato sauce, coffee, water, sugar, salt, and pepper. Bring the soup to a boil and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes.
2. Pour the hot soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until smooth and pour into a clean pot. Stir in the cream and heat until warm. Do not boil.
