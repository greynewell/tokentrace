## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- ¼ cup minced garlic
- ½ cup hot pepper sauce (such as Frank's RedHot®)
- ½ cup white sugar
- vegetable oil for frying
- 10  chicken wings
- 1 ½ tablespoons slivered green onions

## Instructions

1. Chill a metal bowl in the freezer.
2. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir garlic until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Add hot sauce and sugar to garlic; cook and stir until mixture is reduced and bubbling, about 5 minutes.
3. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cook wings in the hot oil until no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
4. Remove wings from hot oil using a slotted spoon and transfer to the chilled bowl. Add garlic-hot sauce to wings and toss to coat. Transfer coated wings to a serving platter and garnish with green onion.
