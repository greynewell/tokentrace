## Ingredients

- ¾ cup butter
- 1 ½ teaspoons lemon juice
- 8 cloves garlic, halved
- 4 (6 ounce) tilapia fillets, rinsed and patted dry
- 1 tablespoon dried parsley

## Instructions

1. Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C); prepare a baking dish with cooking spray.
2. Combine the butter, lemon juice, and garlic in a microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave in 10-second increments until the butter is completely melted and the garlic has softened, stirring between each session, about 1 minute total.
3. Arrange the tilapia in the bottom of the prepared baking dish; pour the butter mixture over the fillets assuring they are all evenly covered. Sprinkle the parsley over the tilapia.
