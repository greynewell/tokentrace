## Ingredients

- 1 (1.5 pound) head green cabbage
- 1 ½ pounds baby red potatoes
- 7 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper, divided
- 2 (6 inch) matzo sheets
- 6 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley, divided
- 1 teaspoon lemon zest
- 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
- 1 (2 pound) skin-on salmon fillet
- 2 tablespoons sherry vinegar
- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- 4 large hard-cooked eggs, chopped
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives
- 2 tablespoons chopped cornichons
- 2 tablespoons non-pareil capers, rinsed and drained

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) with a rack in the upper third. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. Cut cabbage into 1-inch wedges.
2. Toss potatoes with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, 3/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Arrange in an even layer on the prepared baking sheet. Intersperse cabbage wedges on the baking sheet and brush with 1 tablespoon oil.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until starting to brown, about 15 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, break matzo sheets into large pieces and place in a zip-top bag. Carefully pound with the flat end of a glass until coarsely crushed; this should yield 2/3 cup. Transfer to a medium bowl and stir in 4 tablespoons parsley, 2 tablespoons oil, and lemon zest.
5. Spread 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard evenly over the top side of the salmon and sprinkle evenly with 1 teaspoon salt and remaining 3/4 teaspoon pepper. Press matzo mixture onto the mustard.
6. Remove potatoes and cabbage from the oven. Stir potatoes and flip cabbage, then push both to the sides to make space in the center. Place salmon in the center and return to the oven. Bake until matzo is golden brown, potatoes and cabbage are tender, and salmon flakes easily with a fork, about 20 minutes.
7. While salmon bakes, whisk vinegar, 1 teaspoon mustard, and remaining 3 tablespoons oil together in a medium bowl. Fold in eggs, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, chives, cornichons, capers, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt. Serve over salmon and vegetables.
