## Ingredients

- 1 large sweet potato
- 1 cup frozen mixed vegetables, thawed
- 1  banana
- ½ cup raisins
- 1 cup diced apples
- 1 ½ cups quick-cooking oatmeal, corn flakes, granola, or similar cereal

## Instructions

1. Pierce skin of sweet potato several times with a paring knife or skewer. Cook in the microwave on high power until tender, 5 to 9 minutes; turn the potato over halfway through cooking. Allow to cool until cool enough to handle.
2. Peel potato and place flesh into a large mixing bowl. Add mixed vegetables, banana, raisins, apples, and oatmeal. Mix with an electric mixer on high speed until vegetables have been reduced to tiny pieces and mixture is thoroughly combined. If mixture is too dry, add a little water until soft enough to roll into balls.
3. Line a baking sheet with parchment or waxed paper.
4. Roll mixture into marble-sized balls and place onto the prepared baking sheet. Feed Polly a couple now, then place the baking sheet into the freezer until completely frozen.
5. Remove treats from parchment paper and store them in a resealable plastic bag. Defrost treats before serving.
