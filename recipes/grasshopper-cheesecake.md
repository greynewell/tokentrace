## Ingredients

- 1 (15.25 ounce) package mint-flavored, cream-filled chocolate sandwich cookies (such as Mint Creme Oreo®)
- 5 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
- ¾ teaspoon kosher salt, divided
- 3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, at room temperature
- 1 ½ cups white sugar
- ⅔ cup sour cream, at room temperature
- ¼ cup chocolate liqueur (such as Godiva®)
- ¼ cup creme de menthe liqueur
- 3 large eggs, at room temperature
- ½ (4.6 ounce) package creme de menthe thins (such as Andes®)
- 1 sprig fresh mint

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line the bottom and sides of a 9-inch springform pan with 4 layers of aluminum foil.
2. Pulse mint sandwich cookies in a food processor until finely chopped. Add butter and 1/4 teaspoon salt, and pulse until incorporated, about 5 times. Press cookie mixture evenly over bottom and halfway up sides of springform pan.
3. Bake in preheated oven until fragrant and starting to turn crispy, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove and set aside to cool while you prepare the cheesecake filling. Decrease oven temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
4. Combine cream cheese and sugar in the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Beat on medium-high, scraping down sides as necessary, until completely smooth and creamy, 1 to 2 minutes. Add sour cream and beat until combined, about 30 seconds. Add chocolate liqueur, creme de menthe liqueur, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt; beat on medium until combined, about 1 minute. Add eggs, 1 at a time, and beat on low until just incorporated. Pour cheesecake mixture into the cooled crust. Place the springform pan into a large roasting pan.
5. Place roasting pan on center rack in the oven. Carefully pour boiling water into the roasting pan to come 1 inch up the sides of the springform pan, making sure you do not get any water into the cheesecake.
6. Bake until filling is set but still slightly jiggly in center, 60 to 65 minutes. Turn oven off, and prop open door. Let cheesecake cool in oven for 1 hour. Remove roasting pan with cheesecake from oven. Remove cheesecake from roasting pan, and set aside to cool completely, about 45 minutes. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 4 hours, up to overnight.
7. Run a sharp paring knife around edges of crust to loosen from pan. Remove sides of springform pan. Run knife around bottom of cheesecake to loosen. Gently shimmy, or use large spatulas, to transfer onto a cake stand or serving plate. Chop creme de menthe thins. Top cake with chopped thins and sprig of mint. Slice and serve cold or at room temperature.
