## Ingredients

- ¼ cup orange juice
- ¼ cup water
- 1 cup dried currants
- 2 cups rolled oats
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 3 tablespoons white sugar
- 1 cup unsalted butter, cubed
- 1.3 cups cold milk

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Heat the orange juice and the water in a small pan, add the currants. Simmer the mixture for 1 minute, then let it sit until it cools slightly.
