## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
- 4 (6 ounce) fillets grouper fillets
- sea salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ½ cup chopped red onion
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 3 cups chopped Roma tomatoes
- 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
- 1 teaspoon agave nectar
- ¼ cup capers, drained
- 4 tablespoons snipped fresh parsley  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Pat grouper fillets dry and add to the skillet. Cook until lightly browned on one side, about 2 minutes. Remove to a plate. Lightly season the uncooked side with salt and pepper. Keep warm.
2. Add remaining olive oil to the same skillet. Cook and stir onion over medium heat for 1 minute. Add garlic and stir for another 30 seconds to 1 minute. Stir in tomatoes, red wine vinegar, and agave. Move the vegetables to one side of the skillet.
3. Return fillets to the skillet, uncooked side-down. Evenly distribute the vegetables around and over the fish. Sprinkle capers on top. Season with salt and pepper. Cook, uncovered, until the thickest part of the fillet flakes with a fork, 4 to 5 minutes.
4. Serve each fillet with vegetables. Garnish with fresh parsley.
