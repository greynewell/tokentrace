## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 1 ½ cups sifted whole wheat flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 3  ripe bananas, mashed
- ½ cup unsalted butter, melted
- 1  large egg
- ¾ cup white sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ¼ cup packed dark brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons whole wheat flour
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray 10 muffin cups with cooking spray.
2. Whisk 1 1/2 cups sifted whole wheat flour with baking soda, baking powder, salt, and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon in a large bowl. Mix together mashed bananas, 1/2 cup melted unsalted butter, egg, white sugar, and vanilla extract in a separate bowl. Gently fold banana mixture into dry ingredients just until moistened; do not overmix. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups, filling them about 3/4 full.
3. Mix dark brown sugar with 2 tablespoons whole wheat flour and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon in a bowl, stirring until combined; mash 1 tablespoon unsalted butter into the mixture with a fork until streusel topping resembles crumbs. Sprinkle topping over muffins.
4. Bake muffins in the preheated oven until a toothpick comes out clean or with moist crumbs, about 20 minutes.
