## Ingredients

- 1 extra large zucchini
- ¼ cup olive oil, divided
- 6 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- 1  shallot, finely chopped
- ½ pound large shrimp - shelled, deveined, and cut in half
- 1 large tomato - peeled, seeded and diced
- 8  cremini mushrooms, quartered
- ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 8 leaves fresh basil, torn
- ground black pepper to taste
- kosher salt to taste
- garlic powder to taste
- ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. Grease a baking sheet.
2. Cut zucchini in half lengthwise and scoop out seeds and pulp, leaving a thick shell of flesh. Brush both halves of zucchini with 1 tablespoon olive oil and place them cut-side down onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake until zucchini is hot and beginning to release beads of moisture, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove zucchini from the oven.
3. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
4. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet over medium-low heat. Cook and stir garlic and shallot until translucent, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool.
5. Place remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil, shrimp, tomato, mushrooms, 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, basil, and cooked garlic and shallot into a bowl, and stir to mix. Season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Stuff the mixture into zucchini halves, and sprinkle each zucchini with about 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese.
6. Bake stuffed zucchini in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and filling is cooked through and hot, about 20 minutes.
