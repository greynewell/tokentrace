## Ingredients

- ¼ cup vegetable oil
- 5  onions, sliced
- 2 pounds lean beef, cut into 1-inch cubes
- 1 ½ tablespoons all-purpose flour
- ¼ teaspoon dried marjoram
- ¼ teaspoon dried thyme
- freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 1 cup dry red wine
- ½ cup beef broth
- 1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onions in hot oil until tender, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a bowl.
2. Cook and stir beef in the same skillet until browned, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Sprinkle flour, marjoram, thyme, and pepper over beef. Pour red wine and beef broth into the skillet; stir well. Reduce heat to low and simmer until beef is tender, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Add more wine and broth as needed, in a 2:1 ratio, to keep beef barely submerged throughout the cooking time.
3. Stir onions and mushrooms into the skillet. Cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms are tender and sauce is thick and dark brown, about 30 minutes.
