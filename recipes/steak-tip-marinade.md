## Ingredients

- ½ cup Worcestershire sauce
- 1 cup Italian-style salad dressing
- 2 teaspoons garlic pepper seasoning
- 1 cup barbeque sauce
- 2 pounds beef sirloin tip steaks

## Instructions

1. Mix Worcestershire sauce, Italian-style salad dressing, garlic pepper seasoning, and barbeque sauce in a medium bowl. Place steaks in marinade and turn to coat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
2. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.
3. Place steaks on preheated grill; discard marinade. Cook steaks until they are beginning to firm and are hot and slightly pink in the center, about 10 minutes per side, or to desired doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C) for medium.
