## Ingredients

- 2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1 pinch salt
- 1 ½ teaspoons white sugar
- 1 ½ teaspoons dried thyme
- 1 ½ teaspoons dried savory
- 1 teaspoon kelp powder
- 1 tablespoon dried parsley
- 1 tablespoon dried basil
- ⅓ cup unsalted butter, softened
- ¾ cup buttermilk

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
2. Whisk together flour, baking powder, parsley, basil, sugar, thyme, savory, kelp powder, and salt in a large bowl.
3. Cut in butter with a knife or pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Drizzle buttermilk slowly over flour mixture while tossing lightly with a fork, just until flour mixture is moistened.
4. Turn dough out onto a floured board; knead 4 to 5 times. Pat dough into a 3/4-inch-thick circle. Cut out 12 biscuits with a 2-inch cookie cutter, re-shaping dough as needed. Place biscuits 2 inches apart on a baking sheet.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 8 minutes. Serve warm.
