## Ingredients

- ½ cup shredded mozzarella cheese
- ⅓ cup finely ground almond flour
- ⅛ teaspoon garlic powder
- ⅛ teaspoon salt
- 1 large egg yolk

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Combine mozzarella cheese, almond flour, garlic powder, and salt in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat in the microwave for 30 seconds.
3. Use your hands to knead mozzarella dough until fully mixed. Add egg yolk and continue kneading until completely blended into dough.
4. Lay a piece of parchment paper on a flat surface and place dough on top. Place a second piece of parchment paper on top of dough. Press down on dough with your hands until ready for a rolling pin.
5. Roll into a very thin rectangle with even sides. Gently poke holes in dough using a fork to prevent it from bubbling while baking. Cut dough into 1-inch squares with a knife.
6. Lay squares on the prepared baking sheet, leaving a little space between them
7. Bake in the preheated oven for 5 to 6 minutes. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and turn crackers over. Continue baking until lightly browned and crisp, about 2 more minutes. Watch them closely to prevent burning.
