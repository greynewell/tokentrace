## Ingredients

- 1 large russet potato, peeled
- 1 teaspoon plant-based butter (such as Country Crock®)
- 2 tablespoons diced onions
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- ¼ cup plant-based butter (such as Country Crock®)
- 2 tablespoons unsweetened, plain almond milk
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 6  corn tortillas
- avocado oil cooking spray

## Instructions

1. Place potato into a saucepan and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes.
2. While potato is boiling, melt 1 teaspoon plant-based butter in a skillet and saute onions until soft and translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Set aside
3. Drain potato and transfer to a bowl. Pour in 1/4 cup plant-based butter and almond milk, season with salt and pepper, and mash. Mix in onion and garlic until well combined.
4. Heat tortillas in a skillet or directly on the grates of a gas stove until soft and pliable. Place 3 tablespoons of potato mixture down the center of each tortilla, fold over, and roll up.
5. Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
6. Place taquitos in the air fryer basket, making sure they are not touching, and mist with avocado oil. Cook in batches if necessary.
7. Air fry until taquitos are golden brown and crispy, 6 to 9 minutes. Turn taquitos over, mist with avocado oil, and air fry for 3 to 5 minutes more.
