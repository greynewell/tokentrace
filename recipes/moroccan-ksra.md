## Ingredients

- ⅞ cup water
- 2 ¼ cups bread flour
- ¾ cup semolina flour
- 1 teaspoon anise seed
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt
- ½ teaspoon white sugar
- 2 teaspoons active dry yeast
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 tablespoon sesame seeds  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Place the first set of ingredients in the pan of the bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Select DOUGH cycle; press Start. Do not put the olive oil or sesame seeds in.
2. When the dough cycle signals its end, remove the dough from the machine, and punch down. Divide the dough into two halves, and shape into balls. Flatten the balls to a 3/4 inch thickness. Place them on a lightly floured baking sheet. Cover with towels, and let rise until double in size, about 30 minutes.
3. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Brush the top of each loaf with olive oil, and sprinkle with sesame seeds if you like. Prick the tops of the loaves all over using a fork.
4. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the loaves are golden, and sound hollow when tapped. Serve warm or cool.
