## Ingredients

- ½ cup orange juice
- ½ cup water
- 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
- 3 (.25 ounce) packages rapid-rise yeast
- 2 cups white sugar
- 1 cup unsalted margarine (such as Fleischmann's®), melted
- 4  eggs
- 1  orange, zested
- 7 cups bread flour, or more as needed
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 2 coins wrapped in aluminum foil
- 1  egg white
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Mix orange juice, water, and cinnamon in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat in the microwave until the mixture registers 110 degrees F (43 degrees C) on an instant-read thermometer, 1 to 2 minutes.
2. Stir yeast into the orange juice mixture. Let stand until yeast is creamy and frothy, about 45 minutes.
3. Combine sugar and margarine in the bowl of a stand mixer. Beat until creamy. Add eggs; beat on high speed for 30 seconds. Mix in yeast mixture and orange zest until well combined.
4. Sift flour, salt, and baking powder together in a bowl. Add gradually to the mixture in the stand mixer, mixing with a bread hook until a soft, sticky dough forms, about 5 minutes.
5. Transfer dough to a large glass bowl. Cover with plastic wrap; let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, 2 to 4 hours.
6. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 round cake pans.
7. Divide dough into 2 equal pieces. Put 1 wrapped coin in each piece; knead for 2 to 3 minutes and shape into a ball. Place 1 ball of dough in each cake pan. Cover with plastic wrap; let rise until puffy, 2 to 4 hours more.
8. Whisk egg white and vanilla together in a small bowl. Brush over the top of dough.
9. Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center comes out with a few crumbs attached, 30 to 55 minutes.
