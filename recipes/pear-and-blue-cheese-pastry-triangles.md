## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons butter
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 4  sweet onions, thinly sliced
- salt and pepper to taste
- 1 (17.5 ounce) package frozen puff pastry, thawed
- 2  firm pears, peeled, quartered, and sliced
- ¾ cup crumbled blue cheese

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
2. Melt the butter and olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir the onions into the butter, and cook until the onions have softened and caramelized to a deep, golden brown, 30 to 40 minutes. Stir frequently as the onions cook to keep them from burning. Once done, season with salt and pepper, and set aside to cool.
3. Use a sharp knife to cut each sheet of puff pastry into 9 squares. Cut each square in half diagonally to yield 36 triangles. Place the triangles onto the prepared baking sheets, and top with the caramelized onions, pears, and 1 teaspoon of blue cheese.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until the pastry is puffed and golden brown, 20 to 30 minutes. Allow to cool to room temperature before serving.
