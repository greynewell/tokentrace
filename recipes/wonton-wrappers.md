## Ingredients

- 1  egg
- ⅓ cup water
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon salt

## Instructions

1. Beat egg in a medium bowl. Mix in 1/3 cup water.
2. Combine flour and salt in a large bowl. Create a well in the center of the flour mixture and slowly pour in egg and water. Mix well. If the mixture is too dry, increase the amount of water 1 teaspoon at a time until a pliable dough has formed.
3. Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until elastic. Cut dough into two separate balls. Cover dough balls with a damp cloth for a minimum of 10 minutes.
4. Cut each ball into four equal pieces. Roll the pieces into 10 1/2x10 1/2-inch squares. Then cut each square into nine 3 1/2x3 1/2-inch squares for a total of 72 wonton wrappers.
5. Use in any wonton recipe.
