## Ingredients

- 1 pound fresh mushrooms, sliced
- ½ cup chopped onion
- ½ cup dry sherry
- ¼ cup butter
- ¼ cup chopped parsley
- 6 (8 ounce) fillets beef tenderloin
- 1 (17.5 ounce) package frozen puff pastry, thawed

## Instructions

1. Combine mushrooms, sherry, onion, butter, and parsley in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until all the liquid is absorbed and mushrooms are well browned, about 15 to 20 minutes. Allow to cool, then cover the top of each piece of tenderloin with mushroom mixture.
2. Cut each partially thawed puff pastry sheet into 3 rectangles, for a total of 6 pieces of puff pastry. Roll out each puff pastry rectangle to about 1/4-inch thickness and place beef in the center; fold up and seal all the edges, making sure the seams are not too thick. Place on a baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap, and store in the refrigerator until 35 minutes before serving time.
3. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
4. Bake beef Wellingtons in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for medium rare. Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.
