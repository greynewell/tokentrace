## Instructions

5. With spoon, stir in enough remaining flour to make stiff batter.
6. Cover tightly with plastic wrap; refrigerate 2 to 24 hours.
7. Cranberry filling: In medium saucepan, combine chopped cranberries, 1/2 cup sugar, and 1 1/2 teaspoons grated orange peel; bring to boil over medium heat.
