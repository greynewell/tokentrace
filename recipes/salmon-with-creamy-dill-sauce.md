## Ingredients

- 1 (2 pound) salmon fillet
- 1 teaspoon lemon-pepper seasoning
- 1 teaspoon onion salt
- 1 small onion, sliced and separated into rings
- 6 slices  lemon
- ¼ cup butter, cut into small chunks
- ⅓ cup sour cream
- ⅓ cup mayonnaise
- ¼ cup dry white wine
- 1 tablespoon capers
- 1 tablespoon finely chopped onion
- 1 tablespoon caper brine
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon prepared horseradish
- ¾ teaspoon dried dill weed
- ¼ teaspoon garlic salt
- ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil; grease the foil lightly.
2. Place salmon fillet with skin side down on foil. Season salmon with lemon-pepper and onion salt; top with onion rings and lemon slices, dot with butter. Fold foil around salmon and seal tightly.
