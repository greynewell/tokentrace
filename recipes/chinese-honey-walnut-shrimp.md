## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon egg white
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 8 ounces uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
- ¼ cup water
- ¼ cup white sugar
- ½ cup walnut halves
- 3 tablespoons mayonnaise
- ½ tablespoon honey
- ½ tablespoon sweetened condensed milk
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice
- ⅓ cup cornstarch
- vegetable oil for frying

## Instructions

1. Mix egg white and salt together in a bowl; add shrimp and toss to coat evenly. Cover and let shrimp marinate in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
2. Bring water to a boil in a small saucepan. Add sugar; cook until dissolved, about 1 minute. Add walnuts. Turn heat down to medium-low. Cook, stirring occasionally, until syrup thickens and turns into a dark caramel color, 4 to 7 minutes.
3. Line a baking sheet. Pour walnuts onto the baking sheet, spacing the pieces apart. Let cool.
4. Mix mayonnaise, honey, condensed milk, and lemon juice together in a small bowl for the dressing.
5. Drain excess liquid from the shrimp. Place cornstarch in a plastic sandwich bag. Toss shrimp in the cornstarch in batches.
6. Heat 2 to 3 inches of oil in a medium to large pot to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Drop shrimp carefully into the hot oil in batches; fry until golden brown, about 3 minutes per batch. Drain on paper towels to preserve crispiness.
7. Serve shrimp with the walnuts and honey dressing.
