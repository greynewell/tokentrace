## Ingredients

- 1 (18.25 ounce) package devil's food cake mix
- ½ (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
- 6 ounces caramel ice cream topping
- 3 (1.4 ounce) bars chocolate covered toffee, chopped
- 1 (8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease the bottom of a 9x13-inch glass pan.
2. Mix cake mix, water, vegetable oil, and eggs in a large bowl with a mixer on medium speed until well combined. Pour into the prepared pan.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Cut shallow slits across top of cake; make sure not to touch the bottom of the dish.
4. Combine sweetened condensed milk and 6 ounces caramel topping in a saucepan over low heat; stir until smooth. Slowly pour mixture over top of warm cake, letting it soak in. Set aside 1 to 2 tablespoons chopped chocolate toffee for decorating; sprinkle remaining toffee liberally across entire cake.
5. Cool cake completely, then top with whipped topping. Decorate top of cake with the reserved toffee and drizzle with remaining caramel topping.
6. Refrigerate until chilled through and serve right from the pan.
