## Ingredients

- ¼ cup kosher salt
- ¼ cup light brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons garlic powder
- 2 tablespoons smoked paprika
- 1 teaspoon ground dried chipotle pepper
- 1 (4 pound) whole chicken
- 2 tablespoons salted butter, melted

## Instructions

1. Combine salt, brown sugar, garlic powder, paprika, and chipotle pepper in a bowl. Rinse and pat chicken dry. Rub with seasoning blend, placing any excess in the cavity.
2. Allow to rest at room temperature for up to 90 minutes.
3. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
4. Place chicken in the bottom of a Dutch oven. Pour butter over the chicken. Cover.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 2 to 3 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove from the oven and allow to rest, uncovered, for 10 minutes.
6. Carve chicken and spoon over pan drippings before serving.
