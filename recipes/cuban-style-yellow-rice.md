## Ingredients

- 4 cups long grain rice
- 8 cups water
- 1 small onion, minced
- 2 teaspoons salt
- ⅛ teaspoon annatto powder
- ⅛ teaspoon paprika
- black pepper to taste
- 1 cup frozen peas, thawed
- 1 (4 ounce) jar sliced pimento peppers, for garnish

## Instructions

1. Place the rice in a sieve and rinse under cold water until the water runs clear. Shake sieve to remove excess water from rice.
2. Place rice in a large saucepan with a tightly fitting lid and add water. Stir in the onion, salt, annatto powder, paprika, and pepper. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to low, cover pan, and simmer. After cooking for 10 minutes, gently stir the peas into the rice. Cook until all the water is evaporated and the rice is tender, 15 to 20 minutes longer. Serve garnished with pimento slices.
