## Ingredients

- 2 pounds pickling cucumbers, sliced
- ½  yellow onion, sliced
- 2  red jalapeno peppers, thinly sliced into rings
- 3 tablespoons kosher salt
- 2 cups distilled white vinegar
- 2 cups white sugar
- ¼ cup water
- 2 cloves garlic, sliced
- 1 tablespoon mustard seed
- 1 teaspoon celery seeds
- 1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns
- ½ teaspoon ground turmeric
- ⅛ teaspoon ground cloves

## Instructions

1. Combine cucumbers, onion, and peppers in a bowl; pour kosher salt over the top and stir to coat completely. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate, stirring occasionally, 2 to 4 hours. Rinse cucumber mixture in a colander under cold water until all salt is washed away, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain.
2. Stir vinegar, sugar, water, garlic, mustard seed, celery seed, peppercorns, turmeric, and ground cloves together in a saucepan; bring to a simmer and cook until brine flavors combine, about 2 minutes. Add cucumber mixture to brine; heat until almost boiling, remove from heat, and cool completely. Transfer to jars and store in the refrigerator.
