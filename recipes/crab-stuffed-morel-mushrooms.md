## Ingredients

- 6  large fresh morel mushrooms
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese at room temperature
- ½ (8 ounce) package imitation crabmeat, minced
- 1 teaspoon finely chopped green onion, or to taste
- ¼ cup dry breading mix (such as Drake's Crispy Frymix®)
- 2 cups vegetable oil for frying, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Gently clean whole morel mushrooms of dirt and grit; place mushrooms, stem sides down, in a colander and drain for about 5 minutes.
2. Trim bottoms of the hollow stems, so the hole is big enough for filling.
3. Mix cream cheese, crabmeat, and green onion in a bowl until evenly combined.
4. Spoon mixture into a heavy resealable plastic bag.
5. Force the cream cheese mixture into a corner of the bag.
6. Cut a small snip off the corner of the bag.
7. Insert cut tip of the plastic bag into the hollow stem of each mushroom and fill the mushrooms with the cream cheese mixture.
8. Place dry breading mix in a shallow bowl.
9. Roll the stuffed mushrooms in the dry mix; tap off excess breading.
10. Heat vegetable oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
11. Deep-fry the stuffed mushrooms until the breading is golden brown and the mushrooms are tender, 3 to 4 minutes.
12. Allow to drain on paper towels.
