## Ingredients

- 1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- 1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
- 2 ½ cups bread flour
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- ½ cup bread flour
- 1  egg white
- 1 tablespoon water

## Instructions

1. In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in the water.
2. Cover and let set in a warm place for 15 minutes, or until yeast is creamy.
3. Place 2 1/2 cups flour in a large mixing bowl.
4. Stir in the yeast mixture.
5. Pour in the oil and stir until the flour is combined and a loose dough has formed.
6. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead in the remaining flour as is necessary to keep the dough from sticking.
7. Knead until smooth and supple, about 8 minutes.
8. Lightly oil a large bowl, place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil.
9. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
10. Divide the dough into twelve equal pieces and form into oval rolls.
11. Place the rolls on a lightly greased baking sheet.
12. Cover the rolls with a damp cloth and let rise until doubled in volume, about 40 minutes.
13. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
14. In a small bowl, beat together egg white with 1 teaspoon water until frothy.
15. Brush the risen rolls with the egg wash and bake in preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes, until golden brown.
