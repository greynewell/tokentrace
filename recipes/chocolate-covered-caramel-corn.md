## Ingredients

- 4 (3.25 ounce) packages butter-flavored microwave popcorn
- 2 cups dry-roasted peanuts  (Optional)
- 2 cups brown sugar
- 1 cup margarine
- ½ cup light corn syrup
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- 1 (14 ounce) bag chocolate almond bark, broken into pieces

## Instructions

1. Place 1 bag popcorn in the microwave; cook on high until popping begins to slow down, about 2 1/2 minutes. Repeat with remaining bags. Open bags carefully; divide popcorn between 2 shallow baking dishes. Mix in peanuts.
2. Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).
3. Combine brown sugar, margarine, corn syrup, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, stirring enough to blend. Simmer, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes. Remove from heat; mix in vanilla extract and baking soda until mixture is light and foamy.
4. Pour brown sugar mixture over the popcorn-peanut mixture; stir to coat.
5. Bake in the preheated oven, stirring every 25 minutes, until a cooled piece of popcorn is crunchy, about 1 hour.
6. Line a flat work surface with waxed paper. Pour popcorn onto the waxed paper. Break up any large clusters.
7. Melt chocolate almond bark in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 15-second intervals, stirring after each melting, 1 to 3 minutes. Pour into a resealable plastic bag; snip off 1 corner. Drizzle melted chocolate over popcorn. Let popcorn cool completely.
