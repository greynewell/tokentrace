## Ingredients

- 1 (3 pound) butternut squash - peeled, seeded, and cubed
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 8 strips bacon, chopped
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 6 stalks celery, chopped
- 6  carrots, chopped
- 1  bay leaf
- 2 teaspoons curry powder
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1  Granny Smith apple - peeled, cored, and cubed
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 cup apple cider
- 1 ½ quarts chicken stock
- ½ teaspoon ground nutmeg  (Optional)
- 1 ½ cups sour cream

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Place squash in a large bowl and drizzle with olive oil; mix to coat. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Spread squash into a single layer on a baking pan.
3. Roast squash in the preheated oven, turning once, until fork-tender and caramelized, 30 to 40 minutes.
4. Place bacon in a Dutch oven and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Remove bacon slices to a paper towel-lined plate, reserving drippings in the pot.
5. Place onion, celery, carrot, bay leaf, curry powder, thyme, salt, and pepper in the Dutch oven; cook in reserved bacon drippings until carrots and celery are soft. Mix in apples and roasted squash; cook another 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook another minute.
6. Pour apple cider over mixture; reduce heat to medium-low and bring to a simmer, cooking until reduced by half. Stir in chicken stock; simmer over medium-low heat for about 20 minutes.
7. Puree soup in small batches in a blender, or use an immersion blender. If using a blender, don't fill the blender more than halfway. Always remove the center lid piece of a stand blender when blending hot liquids so steam can escape; cover the hole with a dish towel while blending.
8. Stir nutmeg into soup. Garnish each bowl with 1 tablespoon sour cream and some bacon pieces to serve.
