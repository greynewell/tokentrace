## Ingredients

- 1  egg, beaten
- ½  lemon, juiced
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 pinch garlic powder
- 1 pinch paprika
- 6  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth

## Instructions

1. Mix together egg and 1/3 of the lemon juice in a shallow dish or bowl. Mix together flour, garlic powder, and paprika in another shallow dish or bowl.
2. Dip chicken breasts in egg mixture, then flour mixture to coat.
