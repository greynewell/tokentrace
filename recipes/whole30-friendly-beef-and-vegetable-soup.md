## Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon ghee (clarified butter), or as needed
- 2 pounds 95%-lean ground beef
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 medium yellow onion, chopped
- 6 cloves garlic, minced
- 6 medium russet potatoes, peeled and cubed
- 1 cup chopped carrots
- 2 (32 ounce) cartons bone broth
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 1 teaspoon dried basil, or to taste
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano, or to taste
- ½ medium head cabbage, chopped
- smoked sea salt to taste (optional)
- 2 small zucchini, sliced
- 1 cup chopped fresh green beans

## Instructions

1. Heat 1 teaspoon ghee in a large stew pot over medium-high heat. Add ground beef and season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer beef to a plate but leave any grease in the pot.
2. Add onion and garlic to the pot, adding more ghee if needed. Saute until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Set onions and garlic with the beef.
3. Cook potatoes in the pot with residual oil. Season with salt and pepper, and cook for 3 to 5 minutes. Add carrots; saute for 1 to 2 minutes. Add ground beef, onions, and garlic back into the pot; mix to combine.
4. Add bone broth, tomato paste, basil, and oregano; bring to a boil. Add cabbage and simmer for 5 minutes.
5. Add smoked salt, then taste and adjust other seasonings if necessary. Add zucchini and green beans; simmer until vegetables are tender 3 to 5 minutes.
