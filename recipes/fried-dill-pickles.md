## Ingredients

- 1  egg, beaten
- 1 cup milk
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- ¾ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 3 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 (32 ounce) jar sliced dill pickles, drained
- 1 quart vegetable oil for deep-frying

## Instructions

1. In a small bowl, mix together the egg, milk, 1 tablespoon of flour, and Worcestershire sauce. In a separate bowl, stir together the remaining flour, salt, and pepper.
2. Heat oil to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) in a deep-fryer or heavy deep skillet. Dip pickle slices into the milk mixture, then into the flour mixture. Repeat dipping.
