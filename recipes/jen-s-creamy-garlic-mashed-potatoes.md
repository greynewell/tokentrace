## Ingredients

- 2 whole heads garlic, top third sliced off and discarded
- olive oil
- 1 tablespoon sea salt
- 5 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cubed
- 1 cup sour cream
- 1 (4 ounce) package cream cheese
- 1 cup butter
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Place garlic heads in a baking dish and drizzle each with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Bake in the preheated oven until garlic is soft and brown, about 45 minutes.
