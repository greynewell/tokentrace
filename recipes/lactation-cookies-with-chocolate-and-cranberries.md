## Ingredients

- ⅓ cup flaxseed meal
- ⅓ cup water
- 1 cup butter
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 cup brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon coconut oil
- 2  eggs

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Mix flaxseed meal and water together in a bowl; let sit for 3 to 5 minutes.
3. Beat butter, white sugar, brown sugar, and coconut oil into the flaxseed mixture using an electric mixer until a dough forms. Add eggs and mix well. Pour in vanilla extract and mix to combine. Beat in brewer's yeast, pink salt, and baking soda. Add in flour a little at a time on low speed. Stir in oats, chocolate chips, and cranberries.
