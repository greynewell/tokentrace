## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ cups white sugar
- ¼ cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 ¼ cups 2% milk
- 1 large egg, lightly beaten
- 2 tablespoons butter, melted
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 6 teaspoons vanilla extract, divided
- 6 cups confectioners' sugar
- 4 tablespoons hot water, or more as needed

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease donut pans well.
2. Sift flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, and salt together into a large bowl.
3. Whisk milk, egg, butter, oil, and 2 teaspoons vanilla extract together in a small bowl. Stir into flour mixture until just combined.
4. Spoon batter into the prepared donut pans, filling each well 3/4 full.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into a donut comes out clean, about 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for about 5 minutes; tap donuts out onto a sheet pan.
6. Combine confectioners' sugar, hot water, and remaining vanilla extract in a bowl to make the glaze.
7. Place parchment paper under a wire cooling rack. Transfer cooled donuts to the rack and coat in glaze, letting excess drip onto parchment paper; coat the donuts a second time if desired.
