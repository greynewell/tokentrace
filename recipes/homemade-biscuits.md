## Ingredients

- ½ cup unsalted butter
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons baking powder
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- ¾ cup buttermilk
- ¼ cup melted butter, or as needed, divided

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
2. Divide 1/2 cup butter into 12 to 16 small chunks.
3. Mix flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Mix in butter chunks using a pastry blender. Make a well in the middle of the mixture; pour in buttermilk. Mix until dough comes together.
4. Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until just formed together. Cut discs out of dough using a cookie cutter or a cup. Butter both sides of cut biscuit dough with 1/2 of the melted butter. Place biscuits onto a baking sheet.
