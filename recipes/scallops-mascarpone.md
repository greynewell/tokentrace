## Ingredients

- 1 (16 ounce) package medium seashell pasta
- 6 tablespoons butter
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
- 1 clove garlic, chopped
- 1 (10 ounce) package sliced fresh button mushrooms
- 1 bunch asparagus, trimmed and cut into 1 inch pieces
- salt and pepper to taste
- ½ teaspoon onion powder
- 1 pound scallops, rinsed and patted dry
- ¼ cup milk
- 1 (8 ounce) container mascarpone cheese
- 2 tablespoons butter

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta, and cook until tender yet firm to the bite, 7 to 9 minutes. Drain and keep warm.
2. Meanwhile, melt 6 tablespoons of butter with the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Mix in parsley and garlic and cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add mushrooms and asparagus and season with salt, pepper, and onion powder; cook, stirring occasionally until asparagus is tender, about 5 minutes depending on the thickness.
3. Place scallops in the pan, and cook briefly on each side until lightly browned and the center is cooked through, about 3 minutes per side. Remove from the heat when scallops are just finished.
4. While the scallops are cooking, combine milk, mascarpone cheese, and remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir until sauce is warm and butter is completely melted and blended in.
5. Stir sauce into the scallop and vegetable mixture along with the drained pasta. Mix to combine and serve immediately.
