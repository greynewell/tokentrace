## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1  green bell pepper, diced
- ½ cup diced sweet onion
- ½ teaspoon minced garlic
- 1 pound extra-lean (95%) ground beef
- 1 cup whole wheat bread crumbs
- 2  large eggs
- ¾ cup shredded carrot
- ¾ cup shredded zucchini
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ¼ cup ketchup, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a 9x5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray.
2. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir green bell pepper and onion in hot oil until onion is transparent and bell pepper is softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the skillet from heat.
3. Combine ground beef, bread crumbs, carrot, zucchini, eggs, salt, pepper, and bell pepper mixture in a large bowl; mix well using your hands. Press meat mixture into the prepared loaf pan.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, 35 to 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Spread ketchup on top of meatloaf and continue baking until bubbling, about 5 minutes more.
