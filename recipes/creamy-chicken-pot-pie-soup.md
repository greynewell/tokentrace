## Ingredients

- 2 (8 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- 6 tablespoons salted butter
- 6 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 cup evaporated milk
- 2 (32 ounce) cartons chicken broth (such as Swanson®)
- 3 large russet potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks
- 4 medium carrots, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks
- 1 cube chicken bouillon
- 1 ½ teaspoons ground black pepper
- 1 pinch salt
- 1 cup frozen peas
- 1 cup frozen corn

## Instructions

1. Put 1/2 inch of water in a large pan over medium heat; bring to a simmer, about 2 minutes. Place chicken in the simmering water, cover, and cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Transfer chicken to a plate and shred when cool enough to handle.
2. Melt butter in a large pot. Add flour and stir continuously with a wooden spoon or whisk until a thick paste forms; continue cooking roux for 2 minutes. Add evaporated milk; stir until incorporated. Add chicken broth and stir until no lumps remain. Bring to a boil.
3. Add potatoes, carrots, chicken bouillon, pepper, and salt; cook until vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes.
4. Add shredded chicken and frozen peas and corn. Cook until heated through, about 5 more minutes.
