## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons butter, cut into 6 equal-sized pieces
- 1 cup whole milk
- 3  eggs, beaten
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- ½ cup fresh blueberries
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ¼ cup confectioners' sugar, or to taste
- 1  lemon, halved

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place a piece of butter into each cup of a jumbo muffin tin.
2. Place muffin tin into the preheating oven until butter melts, about 5 minutes. Remove and set aside.
3. Stir 1 tablespoon sugar and cinnamon together in a small bowl.
4. Beat milk, 1/4 cup sugar, eggs, and vanilla in a large bowl. Whisk in flour until incorporated. Divide batter among muffin cups. Drop an equal amount of blueberries into each cup, then sprinkle cinnamon-sugar mixture over top.
5. Bake in the preheated oven for 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue baking until popovers are no longer moist in the center, about 25 minutes.
6. Remove from the oven and transfer to a wire rack. Dust tops of popovers with confectioners' sugar and squeeze lemon halves over top. Serve warm.
