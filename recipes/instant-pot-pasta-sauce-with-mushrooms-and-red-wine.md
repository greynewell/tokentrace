## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 8 ounces sliced fresh mushrooms
- 1 cup chopped onions
- 1 teaspoon fennel seeds
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- ¾ cup dry red wine
- 1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
- 1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
- ¾ cup chicken broth, or more as needed
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon dried rosemary, crushed
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or more to taste
- 1 large bay leaf
- freshly ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and select Saute function. Heat olive oil until hot, then add mushrooms, onions, and fennel seeds. Cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 3 minutes. Add garlic, and cook for 1 more minute. Pour in red wine, and simmer until the alcohol has cooked off, about 3 minutes.
2. Add tomatoes, tomato paste, and chicken broth to the pot and bring to a simmer. Stir in sugar, basil, oregano, rosemary, salt, crushed red pepper flakes, bay leaf, and pepper. Turn off Saute function.
3. Close and lock the lid and set the pressure valve to sealing. Select high pressure according to the manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 10 minutes. Allow 10 minutes for pressure to build.
4. When time is up, carefully release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions for 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid.
5. Taste the sauce and adjust seasonings, if necessary. If the sauce is too thick, just stir in a little chicken broth or water until you reach your desired consistency.
