## Ingredients

- 8 ounces almond paste
- 1 cup butter, softened
- 1 cup white sugar
- 4  eggs, separated
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 6 drops red food coloring
- 6 drops green food coloring
- ¼ cup seedless red raspberry jam
- ¼ cup apricot jam
- 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips, melted

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line three 9x13-inch baking pans with parchment paper.
2. Break almond paste apart with a fork in a large bowl. Add butter, sugar, and egg yolks; beat with an electric mixer until mixture is fluffy and smooth. Stir in flour to form a dough.
3. Beat egg whites in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl until stiff peaks form. Gently fold egg whites into dough until combined. Divide dough into 3 equal portions. Mix one portion with red food coloring, and one with green food coloring. Spread each portion into one of the prepared baking pans.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 8 to 10 minutes. Carefully remove from pan and remove parchment paper; cool completely on wire racks.
5. Place green layer onto a piece of plastic wrap large enough to wrap all three layers. Spread green layer with raspberry jam and top with uncolored layer. Spread with apricot jam and top with pink layer. Transfer layers to a baking sheet and enclose with plastic wrap. Place a heavy pan or cutting board on top of wrapped layers to compress. Chill in the refrigerator 8 hours, or overnight.
6. Remove plastic wrap. Top with melted chocolate; refrigerate for 1 hour or until chocolate is firm. Slice into small 1-inch squares to serve.
