## Ingredients

- 1 pound dried Great Northern beans, sorted and rinsed
- 4 cups water
- ¼ cup celery, chopped
- 1 small onion, chopped
- 2  bay leaves
- ¼ teaspoon ground cumin
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon dried parsley
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 2  leeks (bulb only), cut in half lengthwise
- 1 pound cooked ham, cut into bite-size pieces
- 5 slices bacon
- 4 cups chicken stock
- 1 pinch sea salt to taste
- 1 pinch fresh ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Place the beans into a large container and cover with several inches of cool water; let stand 8 hours to overnight. Drain and rinse before using.
2. Combine the soaked beans, 4 cups of water, celery, onion, bay leaves, cumin, garlic powder, and parsley into a slow cooker.
3. Melt the butter with the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir the leeks in the butter mixture until tender and the smaller pieces start to brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer the leeks to the slow cooker. In the same pan, cook and stir the ham until the edges start to brown; stir into the soup. Place the bacon into the hot skillet, and pan-fry until the bacon is crisp, about 10 minutes. Cut the bacon into bite-size pieces and stir into the soup. Pour the chicken stock into the hot skillet, and stir to dissolve any brown flavor bits from the skillet; pour the chicken stock into the soup. Season with sea salt and pepper.
4. Set the cooker to Low cook the soup until the beans are very tender, 6 to 8 hours. Roughly mash about half the beans with a potato masher to thicken the soup.
