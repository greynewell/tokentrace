## Ingredients

- ¼ cup white sugar
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 ¼ cups peeled, cored, and chopped apples
- 1 (16.3 ounce) package refrigerated biscuit dough (such as Pillsbury Grands!®)
- avocado oil cooking spray

## Instructions

1. Line the air fryer basket with parchment paper and preheat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
2. Mix sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Place apples into another bowl and top with 1 tablespoon of cinnamon-sugar mixture. Set aside.
3. Separate each biscuit into 2, for a total of 16 pieces. Roll each piece into a 5-inch circle.
4. Place 1 tablespoon of the apples onto each round and pinch to seal. Roll into a ball and place seam side-down in the basket, making sure they are not touching. Spray with avocado oil and air fry until golden brown, 6 to 8 minutes. Turn balls over and air fry for an additional 4 to 6 minutes. Cook in batches if necessary.
5. Remove from air fryer, spray with avocado oil, and roll in remaining sugar-cinnamon mixture.
