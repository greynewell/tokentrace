## Ingredients

- 2 cups buttermilk
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt
- 4  (3/4 inch thick) halibut fillets
- 1 (8 ounce) package seasoned rye crackers
- 2 tablespoons Greek seasoning
- 3  eggs, beaten
- 2 tablespoons water
- ½ cup butter, melted

## Instructions

1. Set a large resealable plastic bag in a bowl. Pour in the buttermilk and salt. Add the halibut fillets and close the bag. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to 1 day.
2. Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).
3. Place half of the crackers and half of the Greek seasoning into a blender. Cover and pulse until they become fine crumbs. Pour into a shallow bowl, and repeat with remaining crackers and Greek seasoning. Whisk eggs with water in a separate bowl.
4. Remove halibut from the bag and discard the marinade. Dip fish into the egg and then in the crumbs until evenly coated. Place coated fillets into a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Do not let them touch, as they will weld themselves together. Drizzle the butter on top of the fish.
5. Bake uncovered in the preheated oven until fish is opaque and flakes easily with a fork, about 45 minutes.
