## Ingredients

- 4  egg whites
- 2  eggs
- 1 cup low-fat cottage cheese
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 bunch asparagus, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces
- ½  white onion, chopped
- 2 teaspoons olive oil

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Pour egg whites, eggs, and cottage cheese into a blender; pulse several times to mix and blend until smooth, about 1 minute.
3. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir asparagus and onion until asparagus is tender, about 8 minutes.

5. Fit pie crust into a 9-inch deep-dish pie plate and spread shrimp into the crust; top with asparagus mixture. Pour cottage cheese mixture over vegetables and shrimp. Spread Monterey Jack cheese over the top of the quiche. Sprinkle green onions over cheese.
