## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups red wine vinegar
- ¾ cup red wine
- 7 cloves garlic, crushed
- 3  bay leaves
- 8  whole cloves, or to taste
- 2 tablespoons ground black pepper
- 2 teaspoons salt
- ½ teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 (3 pound) boneless pork shoulder, cut into 1-inch cubes
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil

## Instructions

1. Whisk red wine vinegar, red wine, garlic, bay leaves, cloves, black pepper, salt, and thyme together in a bowl; pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add the pork, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator 2 to 4 days, turning occasionally.
2. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
3. Drain the pork, reserving 1/2 cup of marinade. Put pork and reserved marinade in a baking dish.
4. Bake in preheated oven until the pork is completely warmed, about 20 minutes. Drain as much liquid from the pork as possible.
5. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add the pork to the skillet in batches to prevent crowding; cook and stir in hot oil until completely browned and no longer pink in the center, 10 to 15 minutes.
