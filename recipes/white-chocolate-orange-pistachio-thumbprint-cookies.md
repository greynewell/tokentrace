## Ingredients

- 1 cup butter, softened
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 2  egg yolks
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1 (3.4 ounce) package instant pistachio pudding mix
- 2 cups white chocolate chips
- ¼ cup whole milk
- 1 tablespoon grated orange zest
- 2 ounces roasted, salted pistachios, finely chopped

## Instructions

1. Combine butter, sugar, egg yolks, and vanilla extract in large bowl. Beat using an electric mixer until well mixed. Add flour, salt, and pudding mix; beat well. Chill dough in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
2. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
