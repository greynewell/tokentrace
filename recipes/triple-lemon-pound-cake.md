## Ingredients

- 2 sticks butter, softened
- ½ cup vegetable oil
- 3 cups white sugar
- 5  eggs, at room temperature
- 3 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour, sifted twice
- ½ teaspoon baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup milk
- 1  lemon, zested and juiced

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10-inch tube pan.
2. Beat butter in a bowl with an electric mixer until creamy. Add oil; beat until creamy. Pour in sugar and beat until thoroughly incorporated, pausing to scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.
