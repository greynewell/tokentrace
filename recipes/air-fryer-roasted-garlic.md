## Ingredients

- 1 head garlic
- aluminum foil
- 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper

## Instructions

1. Preheat the air fryer to 380 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Cut the top off the head of garlic and place on a square piece of aluminum foil. Bring the foil up and around garlic. Pour olive oil on top and season with salt and pepper. Close ends of foil over garlic, creating a pouch.
3. Air fry until garlic is soft, 16 to 20 minutes. Open the foil pouch very carefully, as hot steam will escape.
