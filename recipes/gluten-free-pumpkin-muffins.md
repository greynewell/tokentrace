## Ingredients

- ½ cup tapioca flour
- ½ cup brown rice flour
- ¾ cup white rice flour
- ¼ cup sorghum flour
- 1 ½ teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ¼ teaspoon ground cloves
- ¼ teaspoon ground ginger
- ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
- 3  eggs
- ½ cup packed brown sugar
- ¼ cup milk
- ¼ cup butter, melted
- 1 ½ cups confectioners' sugar
- ¼ cup butter, melted
- 2 tablespoons milk, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 18 muffin cups.
2. Whisk tapioca flour, brown rice flour, white rice flour, sorghum flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, cloves, ginger, and nutmeg in a bowl until thoroughly combined. Mix pumpkin, eggs, brown sugar, milk, and 1/4 cup melted butter in a separate bowl; beat for 2 minutes. Gradually mix dry ingredients into pumpkin mixture to make a smooth batter; scoop batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling them 3/4 full.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until muffins are lightly browned and a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool muffins on wire racks.
4. Stir confectioners' sugar with 1/4 cup melted butter in a bowl until thoroughly combined. Stir milk into the glaze, about 1 teaspoon at a time, until the glaze is thin and runny. Drizzle glaze on top of cooled muffins.
