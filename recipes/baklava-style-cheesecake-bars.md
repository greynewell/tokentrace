## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 12 sheets frozen phyllo dough, thawed
- ¼ cup unsalted butter, melted
- 2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, at room temperature
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ½ cup honey
- ½ cup water
- ½ cup finely chopped walnuts
- ¼ cup finely chopped pistachio nuts
- 1 tablespoon fresh lemon zest

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line the bottom and sides of a 9x13-inch baking dish with parchment paper, allowing excess to hang over sides. Lightly grease with cooking spray.
2. Place 1 sheet phyllo dough in the prepared pan, pressing phyllo into the bottom; brush with some butter. Layer with remaining 11 phyllo sheets, brushing each layer with butter. Keep unused phyllo covered with a damp paper towel to prevent it from drying out while working.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until light golden brown, about 5 minutes. Place on a wire rack and let cool slightly, 10 to 15 minutes.
4. While phyllo cools, reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
5. Beat cream cheese with an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment on medium speed until smooth, 2 to 3 minutes. Add sugar and vanilla extract; beat on medium speed until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes, stopping occasionally to scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed. Spread in an even layer over cooled phyllo.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until filling has set, 35 to 40 minutes. Let cool in the pan on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Refrigerate until completely cooled, about 45 minutes more.
7. Meanwhile, bring honey and water to a boil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium and simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened and syrupy, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in walnuts, pistachios, and lemon zest until combined. Let cool to room temperature, about 45 minutes.
8. Spoon over cooled cheesecake. Using excess parchment, lift cheesecake out of the pan, and slice into 2x2-inch bars.
