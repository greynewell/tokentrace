## Ingredients

- ½ cup olive oil
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 2 cups boiling water
- 2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
- ⅓ cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
- 2  eggs
- 2 cups whole wheat flour
- 4 cups bread flour

## Instructions

1. In a small bowl, combine olive oil, white sugar and salt. Add boiling water and stir to dissolve sugar; let cool to lukewarm.
2. In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.
3. When sugar and water mixture has cooled, add yeast mixture, eggs, whole wheat flour and 2 cups bread flour. Stir in the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, beating well after each addition. When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.
4. Divide the dough into twenty four equal size pieces and form into rounds. Place the rounds on lightly greased baking sheets. Cover the rolls with a damp cloth and let rise until doubled in volume, about 40 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
5. Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 to 20 minutes.
