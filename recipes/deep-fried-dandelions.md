## Ingredients

- 30  dandelion flowers
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon curry powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1  egg
- ½ cup lager-style beer, or more if needed
- 2 cups canola oil for frying

## Instructions

1. Wash dandelions under cool running water and dry on paper towels. Remove the green tendrils behind each flower. Set aside.
2. Mix together flour, curry powder, and salt in a small bowl or measuring cup. Beat egg in a large bowl; stir in flour mixture until smooth. Pour in beer; mix until batter is similar to runny pancake batter. Add more beer if batter is too thick.
3. Heat oil in a small saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). If you don't have a thermometer, heat oil until it begins to shimmer.
4. Working in batches, dip dandelion flowers into batter, then gently drop in hot oil and fry until golden, about 3 minutes. Transfer cooked flowers to crumpled paper towels or a wire rack; serve warm.
