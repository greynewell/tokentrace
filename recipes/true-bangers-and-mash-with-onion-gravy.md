## Ingredients

- 4 links pork sausage
- 2 pounds potatoes, peeled and cubed
- ¼ cup butter
- 2 tablespoons milk  (Optional)
- 1 teaspoon dry mustard powder
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 2 large onions, chopped
- 6 cups beef broth
- 2 cups red wine

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).
2. Cook sausages in a skillet over medium-low heat until browned, about 5 minutes per side; transfer to an oven-safe dish and keep warm in the preheated oven.
3. Place potatoes into a saucepan over medium heat and cover with water; bring to a boil and simmer until potatoes are tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for a minute or two. Mix in 1/4 cup of butter, milk, dry mustard, salt, and black pepper; mash until fluffy and smooth. Set aside.
4. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions; cook and stir until translucent and just starting to brown, about 8 minutes. Pour in beef broth and red wine; bring to a boil and simmer until reduced to half its volume, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper.
5. Serve sausages with mashed potatoes; pour onion gravy on top.
