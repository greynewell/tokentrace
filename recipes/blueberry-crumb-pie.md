## Ingredients

- 1 (9 inch) unbaked pie crust
- ¾ cup white sugar
- ⅓ cup all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons grated lemon zest
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 5 cups fresh or frozen blueberries
- ⅔ cup packed brown sugar
- ¾ cup rolled oats
- ½ cup all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 6 tablespoons butter

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Make the pie: Press pie pastry into the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch pie plate to form a crust.
3. Whisk together sugar and flour in a large bowl. Mix in lemon juice and zest, then gently stir in blueberries. Pour mixture into the pie crust.
4. Make the topping: Combine oats, brown sugar, flour, and cinnamon in a medium bowl. Cut in cold butter with 2 knives or pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Spread the topping evenly over the pie filling.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until filling is bubbly and topping is golden brown, about 40 minutes.
6. Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack before serving.
