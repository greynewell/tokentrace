## Ingredients

- 8 (6 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
- salt and pepper to taste
- ¾ cup sun-dried tomatoes
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 4 cloves garlic clove, minced
- 1 (10 ounce) can cream of chicken soup
- ½ cup milk
- 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
- salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Season chicken with Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. Place chicken in a baking dish and cook in preheated oven for about 20 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, fill a small saucepan halfway with water and bring to a boil. Cook sun-dried tomatoes in the boiling water until soft, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove the tomatoes from the water and puree in a food processor until smooth.
4. Heat olive oil and butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook garlic in butter and oil until garlic turns brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in the cream of chicken soup and milk. Cook 5 to 7 minutes, stirring frequently. Season with Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. Stir in the pureed tomato and simmer 5 minutes. Add baked chicken breasts to the pan and simmer until chicken is completely cooked through and juices run clear, about 5 minutes.
