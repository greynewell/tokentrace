## Ingredients

- 1 pint fresh black raspberries
- 2 cups heavy whipping cream, divided
- ½ cup low-fat milk
- 1 cup white sugar
- 2  eggs, beaten
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 large bowl of ice water to cool the mixture

## Instructions

1. Place black raspberries in the bowl of a food processor; puree until smooth. Pour black raspberry puree in a saucepan and simmer over low heat until slightly reduced, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool.
2. Combine 1 cup cream, milk, and sugar in a 4-quart saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Boil for 2 minutes.
3. Beat eggs in a bowl and slowly mix half of the hot cream mixture into the eggs without scrambling them. Return entire mixture back to the sauce pan and add remaining 1 cup cream. Continue cooking over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until mixture starts to thicken, about 5 minutes.
4. Combine 1 cup of cream mixture, the black raspberry puree, and vanilla extract in a blender; blend until well-combined. Pour mixture back into the saucepan with the remaining cream mixture and stir until well combined. Cook and stir until custard has thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon, 3 to 5 minutes.
5. Pour mixture into a 1-gallon resealable freezer bag and submerge in the bowl of ice water. Let stand until cool, about 30 minutes, adding more ice if necessary.
6. Pour the cooled mixture into an ice cream maker and process according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfer to the freezer and freeze until solid.
