- 2 teaspoons baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 1 cup fresh raspberries, divided
- 2 cups white sugar
- 1 ½ cups vegetable oil
- 1 (8 ounce) container sour cream

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 12x8-inch fluted tube pan (such as Bundt®).
2. Sift flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon together in a large bowl and set aside.
3. Cut 3/4 cup raspberries in half and leave remaining 1/4 cup whole. Set aside.

5. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 55 to 60 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool completely, about 30 minutes.
