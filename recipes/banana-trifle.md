## Ingredients

- 2 (3.5 ounce) packages instant banana pudding mix
- 1 quart cold milk
- 2  bananas, chopped
- 4 cups heavy cream
- 4 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 cup confectioners' sugar
- 1 (12 ounce) package prepared pound cake, cubed
- ½ (12 ounce) box vanilla wafers (such as Nilla®), crushed

## Instructions

1. Whisk pudding mix with milk until smooth. Stir in chopped bananas; set aside.
2. In a large bowl, whip cream until stiff peaks are just about to form. Beat in vanilla and sugar until peaks form. Make sure not to over-beat, or cream will become lumpy and butter-like.
3. Layer half the pound cake cubes, half the pudding, half the whipped cream, and half the crushed vanilla wafers in a trifle bowl. Repeat with the remaining cake, pudding, and whipped cream, and top with the remaining crushed wafers. Chill in the refrigerator until ready to serve.
