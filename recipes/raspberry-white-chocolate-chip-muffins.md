## Ingredients

- 2 cups cake flour
- ⅓ cup white sugar
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- 1 pinch salt
- ¾ cup buttermilk
- 1 large egg
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ¼ cup unsalted butter, melted
- 2 cups fresh raspberries
- ½ cup miniature white chocolate chips
- 3 tablespoons seedless raspberry jam
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- ¼ cup miniature white chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease and flour a 12-cup muffin tin or use paper liners.
2. Sift flour, sugar, baking powder, and baking soda together in a large bowl.
3. Combine buttermilk, egg, and vanilla extract together in a small bowl and whisk together.
4. Add buttermilk mixture and melted butter to flour mixture, whisking until just moistened; batter will be lumpy. Fold in raspberries, miniature white chocolate chips, and raspberry jam. Fill muffin cups with batter.
5. Combine sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Sprinkle topping on muffins. Top with white chocolate chips.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, 18 to 20 minutes.
7. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring to a rack to cool completely, about 30 minutes more.
