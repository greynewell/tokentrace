## Ingredients

- 1 ½ teaspoons olive oil
- 1 ½ teaspoons butter
- ½  white onion, chopped
- 1 cup chopped fresh cilantro, divided
- 3 cups chopped fresh mushrooms
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 6 cups chicken broth
- 5 cups chopped endive
- 2 cups milk
- ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste
- 2 cups plain yogurt

## Instructions

1. Heat olive oil and butter in a Dutch oven or soup pot over medium heat. Add the onion, 1/2 cup of cilantro, and mushrooms; cook and stir until tender. Season with salt and pepper.
2. Pour in the chicken broth, and bring to a boil. Stir in the endive and remaining cilantro. Add the milk, and simmer for about 30 minutes over low heat. Season with cayenne pepper to taste.
3. Place the yogurt in a separate pan or bowl, and gradually ladle in about 2 cups of the hot broth while stirring constantly. Stir this mixture back into the main soup pot, and remove from heat. If this procedure is not followed, the yogurt will break down into little bits. It will still taste good, but does not look the same. Ladle into bowls, and garnish with additional fresh cilantro.
