## Ingredients

- 1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- 1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 2 ears fresh corn
- 3 ½ cups chopped romaine lettuce
- 1 ½ cups chopped cooked bacon
- 1 ½ cups chopped avocado
- 1 cup chopped Roma tomatoes
- 1 cup chopped red onion
- 1 cup ranch dressing
- 6 (8 inch) flour tortillas

## Instructions

1. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Season chicken with salt and pepper.
2. Cook chicken and corn on the preheated grill until chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear and corn is tender, 5 to 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the chicken breasts should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove from heat and allow to cool enough to handle, about 5 minutes. Cut corn kernels from the cobs. Slice chicken into 1/2-inch pieces.
3. Combine chicken, corn, lettuce, bacon, avocado, tomatoes, and onion in a mixing bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Add ranch dressing and mix well.
4. To assemble, place 2/3 cup of the mixture on the bottom 1/3 of a tortilla. Fold in the sides and roll tight. Continue with remaining tortillas.
