## Ingredients

- 2 pints fresh strawberries
- 6 teaspoons white sugar
- 1 ¼ cups white sugar
- ½ cup unsalted butter, softened
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 3 large eggs
- ¼ cup vegetable oil
- 1 teaspoon strawberry extract
- 4 drops red food coloring  (Optional)
- 2 cups all-purpose flour, sifted
- 1 (16 ounce) package confectioners' sugar
- ½ cup unsalted butter, softened
- ¼ cup heavy cream
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour 2 round 9-inch cake pans that are at least 1 1/2 inches high.
2. Sprinkle strawberries with sugar in a bowl and let sit for at least 20 minutes, or until juices accumulate.
3. Puree strawberries in a blender until smooth and set aside.
4. Combine sugar, butter, and vanilla extract in a separate bowl and beat with an electric mixer. Add eggs and beat until smooth. Add 1 cup strawberry puree, oil, strawberry extract, and food coloring. Mix well. Add flour, gently folding until well mixed. Pour batter evenly into the prepared cake pans.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Run a table knife around the edges to loosen. Invert carefully onto a serving plate or cooling rack. Let cool, about 30 minutes.
6. Make the frosting while the cakes cool. Combine confectioners' sugar, butter, heavy cream, 4 tablespoons of strawberry puree, and vanilla extract in a bowl. Whip thoroughly, adding more puree to color and taste as needed.
7. Sandwich cake layers with frosting. Cover the top and sides with remaining frosting.
