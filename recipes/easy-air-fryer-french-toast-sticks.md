## Ingredients

- 4 slices slightly stale thick bread, such as Texas toast
- parchment paper
- 2  eggs, lightly beaten
- ¼ cup milk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1 pinch ground nutmeg  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Cut each slice of bread into thirds to make sticks. Cut a piece of parchment paper to fit the bottom of the air fryer basket.
2. Preheat air fryer to 360 degrees F (180 degrees C).
3. Stir together eggs, milk, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a bowl until well combined. Dip each piece of bread into egg mixture, making sure each piece is well submerged. Shake each bread stick to remove excess liquid and place in a single layer in the air fryer basket. Cook in batches, if necessary, to avoid overcrowding the fryer.
4. Cook for 5 minutes, turn bread pieces, and cook for an additional 5 minutes.
