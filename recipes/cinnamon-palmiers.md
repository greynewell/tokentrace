## Ingredients

- ¼ cup white sugar
- 1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed
- 1 tablespoon butter, melted
- ⅓ cup white sugar
- ¾ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ⅛ teaspoon ground cardamom
- water

## Instructions

1. Sprinkle a flat work surface with 1/4 cup sugar; unfold puff pastry over sugar and roll out to a 15x10-inch rectangle. Brush pastry with butter. Mix 1/3 cup sugar, cinnamon, and cardamom in a small bowl; sprinkle evenly over buttered pastry.
2. Starting with a long edge of the pastry, roll pastry tightly around filling, stopping in the middle. Repeat with the opposite edge, meeting the first roll. Put a little water onto your finger and dot along the long edges that come together; press gently so the two rolled edges stay together. Refrigerate until slightly firm, 5 to 10 minutes.
3. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
4. Cut pastry into 1/4-inch slices. Arrange slices on prepared baking sheet about 1 inch apart.
5. Bake in preheated oven until golden and crisp, about 12 minutes. Allow cookies to rest on baking sheet for 1 minute before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
