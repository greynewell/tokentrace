## Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon active dry yeast
- 1 cup lukewarm water
- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- ¼ cup white sugar
- ⅛ cup vegetable oil
- 1 teaspoon fine salt
- 3 cups all-purpose flour, divided
- ⅛ cup fine bread crumbs, divided, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Pour yeast into water. Add 1 teaspoon sugar and set aside to soften, about 7 minutes.
2. Mix 1/4 cup sugar, oil, and salt together in a bowl. Add softened yeast mixture and 1/2 of the flour. Mix well. Add remaining flour little by little, mixing constantly, until dough does not stick to the sides of the mixing bowl.
3. Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead until smooth. Form into a ball and place in a lightly greased bowl. Brush surface of dough with more vegetable oil and cover with a damp cloth. Let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 2 hours.
4. Punch dough down and roll into 2-inch rounds. Cover rolls with 1/2 of the fine bread crumbs and let rise again, 15 to 20 minutes.
5. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
6. Cut rounds into 1 1/2-inch pieces and arrange on a slightly greased baking sheet, cut-side up. Sprinkle with remaining bread crumbs and let rise until doubled in size, about 30 minutes more.
7. Bake in the preheated oven until slightly brown, 20 to 25 minutes.
