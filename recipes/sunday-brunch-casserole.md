## Ingredients

- 1 ½ pounds thick sliced bacon
- ½ cup chopped sweet onion
- ½ cup chopped red bell pepper
- 12  eggs
- 1 cup milk
- 1 (16 ounce) package frozen hash brown potatoes, thawed
- 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon dried dill

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.

4. Whisk eggs and milk in a large bowl. Fold hash browns, Cheddar cheese, salt, pepper, dill, onion mixture, and crumbled bacon into egg mixture; transfer to prepared baking dish.
