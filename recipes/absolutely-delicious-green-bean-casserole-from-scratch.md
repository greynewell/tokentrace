## Ingredients

- 2 (12 ounce) packages frozen French cut green beans
- 8 ounces crimini mushrooms, quartered
- 3 tablespoons butter
- 1 small onion, halved and thinly sliced
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon lemon zest
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 pinch ground black pepper
- ½ cup milk
- 1 cup sour cream
- ½ cup shredded Cheddar cheese
- 1 (2.8 ounce) can canned French fried onions

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Place green beans in a saucepan and fill with about 1/2 inch water; bring to a boil. Cover and steam until beans are tender but still bright green, about 5 minutes. Drain.
3. Combine drained beans in a bowl with mushrooms; toss to combine.
4. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and parsley; cook and stir until onion is tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Whisk in flour until blended, then mix in lemon zest, salt, and pepper. Gradually whisk in milk, stirring constantly, so that no lumps form.
5. Add sour cream and stir until combined. Warm over medium heat until sauce begins to bubble. Dump in green beans and mushrooms, stirring to coat.
6. Remove from the heat and toss briefly with 1/2 of the Cheddar cheese and 1/2 of the French-fried onions. Spoon into a 1 1/2-quart casserole dish; top with the remaining Cheddar and onions.
7. Bake in the preheated oven until Cheddar is melted, about 15 minutes.
