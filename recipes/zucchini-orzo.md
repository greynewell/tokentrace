## Ingredients

- 12 ounces uncooked orzo pasta
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1  sweet onion (such as Vidalia®), chopped
- 1 cup chopped green onion
- 1  zucchini, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
- 1  yellow squash, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
- 1 teaspoon dried parsley
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat.
2. Once the water is boiling, stir in the orzo and lemon juice, and return to a boil.

4. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.
5. Transfer the orzo to a large saucepan.
6. Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat, and cook the sweet onion and green onion until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes; stir in the zucchini and squash, and cook until the squash are tender, about 15 minutes.
