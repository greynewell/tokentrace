## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups grated Cheddar cheese
- ⅓ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- ½ teaspoon dried oregano
- ½ teaspoon dried basil
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- salt and pepper to taste
- 2 medium zucchinis, thinly sliced
- 5  plum tomatoes, thinly sliced
- ¼ cup butter
- 2 tablespoons finely chopped onion
- ¾ cup fine bread crumbs

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly butter a 9x9-inch pan.
2. In a large bowl, combine Cheddar, Parmesan, oregano, basil, and garlic. Season with salt and pepper, and set aside.
3. Arrange half of the zucchini slices in the pan. Sprinkle 1/4 of the cheese and herb mixture on top. Arrange half of the tomatoes, and top with another 1/4 of the cheese mixture. Repeat layers.
4. Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in onions, and cook until soft and translucent. Stir in breadcrumbs; cook until they have absorbed the butter. Sprinkle on top of casserole.
5. Cover loosely with foil, and bake in a preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake until the top is crusty and the vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes.
