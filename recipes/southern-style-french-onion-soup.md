## Ingredients

- 4 tablespoons butter
- 1  onion, sliced
- ½ teaspoon dried thyme
- 5 (10.5 ounce) cans beef consomme
- 6  bay leaves
- ½ cup white wine  (Optional)
- 1  French baguette, cut into 1/2 inch slices
- 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
