## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 2 cups julienne celery
- 2  onions, chopped
- 4 cloves crushed garlic
- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 2 (14.5 ounce) cans crushed tomatoes
- 1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
- 1  bay leaf, crushed
- 1 tablespoon hot pepper sauce
- 2 pounds medium shrimp - peeled and deveined

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a Dutch oven on medium heat. Saute celery, onions, and garlic in the Dutch oven until the onions are pearly white and the celery has begun to soften.
2. Mix sugar, flour, salt, pepper and cayenne pepper into the Dutch oven. Add crushed tomatoes and tomato sauce, both pieces of bay leaf, and hot sauce. Bring the mixture to a boil, then turn the heat to low.
3. Let the mixture simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
4. Approximately 15 minutes before serving, add shrimp to the pot and stir well. If necessary, raise the temperature to medium-low to ensure the Creole is bubbling but not burning. Scoop out the bay leaf halves before serving. Serve when the shrimp is pink and thoroughly cooked.
