## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- ½ cup white sugar
- 3 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¾ cup apple cider
- ¼ cup vegetable oil
- 1  egg
- 1 cup apples- peeled, cored, and finely diced
- ⅓ cup packed brown sugar
- ⅓ cup rolled oats
- ⅓ cup chopped pecans
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- 3 tablespoons butter, melted

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease the bottoms of 12 muffin cups or line with paper liners.
2. Combine flour, white sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt in a medium bowl; mix well.
3. Combine apple cider, vegetable oil, and egg in another bowl; blend well. Add flour mixture all at once and stir just until moistened; batter will be lumpy. Stir in apples.
4. Combine brown sugar, oats, pecans, and flour in a medium bowl for topping; mix well. Mix in melted butter until all ingredients are moistened and clumpy.
5. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 2/3 full. Top each with a generous amount of streusel topping.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, 18 to 22 minutes. Let cool for 1 minute before removing from the pan. Serve warm.
