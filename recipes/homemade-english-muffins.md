## Ingredients

- 21 ounces white bread flour (4 1/2 cups)
- 2 ¼ teaspoons instant dry yeast
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt
- 14 ounces lukewarm whole milk
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 2 tablespoons butter, softened
- 1 large egg, at room temperature, slightly beaten
- ¼ cup semolina, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Place flour into a large mixing bowl. Sprinkle yeast on one side of the flour and salt on the other side. Add milk, sugar, butter, and egg; mix to make a soft dough.
2. Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead until soft, smooth, and stretchy, about 10 minutes.
3. Place dough into a large oiled bowl. Cover and let rise in a warm place until double the size, about 1 hour.
4. Deflate the dough and divide into 16 pieces. Press each into English muffin rings. Sprinkle both sides with semolina and let rest another 30 minutes.
5. Preheat a griddle to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C), or a heavy-based frying pan over low heat. Cook the muffins on the preheated griddle or pan until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a muffin reaches 200 F (93 degrees C), 7 to 10 minutes per side.
