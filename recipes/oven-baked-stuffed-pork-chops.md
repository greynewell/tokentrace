## Ingredients

- 6 (1-inch thick) boneless pork chops
- 1 tablespoon adobo seasoning
- 1 (.18 ounce) packet sazon seasoning
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ⅓ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 3 tablespoons Italian dressing, divided
- 1 ½ cups water
- ¼ cup margarine
- 6 (6 ounce) packages dry stuffing mix (such as Stove Top®)
- toothpicks
- 1 tablespoon water, or as desired

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
2. Place pork chops in a large bowl and season all sides with adobo seasoning, sazon seasoning, garlic powder, pepper, and salt; add 2 tablespoons Italian dressing and flip to coat.
3. Bring 1 1/2 cups water and margarine to a boil in a saucepan; add stuffing mix and cover. Remove saucepan from heat and set aside until stuffing absorbs water, about 5 minutes; fluff with a fork.
4. Remove pork chops from bowl, reserving liquid and seasonings. Lay each pork chop flat on cutting board and with a sharp knife held parallel to the board, cut a pocket into the pork, leaving 3 sides intact. Stuff each pork chop with stuffing and close pocket using a toothpick.
5. Arrange pork chops on a baking sheet. Mix remaining 1 tablespoon Italian dressing and 1 tablespoon water with reserved juices from pork chops; pour over pork chops.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until pork chops are cooked through, 25 to 35 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
