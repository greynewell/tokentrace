## Ingredients

- 1 (14 ounce) package chocolate sandwich cookies (such as Oreo®), crushed
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, at room temperature
- 1 (12 ounce) package vanilla-flavored almond bark, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Mix cookie crumbs and cream cheese together in a bowl; roll into balls and arrange on the prepared baking sheet. Freeze cookie balls until solid, about 1 hour.
3. Melt almond bark in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching.
4. Dip cookie balls in the melted almond bark, removing balls using 2 forks to allow excess bark drip back into double boiler. Arrange coated cookie balls on the baking sheet; refrigerate until coating is firm, about 10 minutes.
