## Ingredients

- ¾ cup butter
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1  beaten egg
- ¼ cup molasses
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking soda
- 1 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon ground cloves
- ½ teaspoon nutmeg
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 (12 ounce) package white chocolate chips
- ½ cup white sugar, for rolling

## Instructions

1. Beat butter and 1 cup of sugar together in a mixing bowl until smooth; stir in beaten egg and molasses.
2. Whisk flour, baking soda, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and salt together in another large bowl; stir the flour mixture into the molasses mixture by half cupfuls. Stir in white chocolate chips. Refrigerate dough for at least 1 hour.
3. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
4. Scoop up a generous spoonful of dough, and roll it into a ball. Roll the ball in sugar; place onto an ungreased baking sheet and flatten slightly. Sprinkle a little sugar onto the cookie, if desired. Repeat for the rest of the cookies.
5. Bake cookies in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Allow to cool on the baking sheet for about 1 minute before removing to finish cooling on racks.
