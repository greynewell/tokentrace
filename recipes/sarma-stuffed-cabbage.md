## Ingredients

- 1 large head cabbage
- 1 pound lean ground beef
- ½ pound ground pork
- ½ pound ground ham
- 1 cup uncooked long-grain white rice
- 1  onion, finely chopped
- 1  egg
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon coarse ground black pepper
- 1 pound sauerkraut
- 1 cup tomato juice
- water to cover

## Instructions

1. Place cabbage in the freezer for a few days. The night before making the rolls, take it out to thaw.
2. In a large bowl, combine the beef, pork, ham, rice, onion, egg, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Mix well. Form meat mixture into oblong balls, using 1/2 cup of the mixture at a time. Then, wrap a cabbage leaf around each ball.
3. Spread the sauerkraut in the bottom of a large pot, then layer cabbage rolls on top, placing them seam-side down. Pour tomato juice over rolls, then add enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer for about 3 hours, adding more water as necessary.
