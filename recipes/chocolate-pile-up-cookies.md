## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- ¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
- ¾ cup white sugar
- ¾ cup brown sugar
- 2  eggs
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 2 tablespoons coffee-flavored liqueur
- 1 cup finely chopped toasted hazelnuts
- 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
- 1 cup milk chocolate chips
- 1 cup white chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper. In a bowl, mix the flour, cocoa, baking soda, and salt.
2. Beat the butter, white sugar, and brown sugar together in a bowl with an electric mixer until soft and creamy, then beat in the eggs, vanilla extract, and coffee liqueur. Gradually beat the flour mixture into the butter-sugar mixture until well combined. Stir in the hazelnuts, semisweet chocolate chips, milk chocolate chips, and white chocolate chips until evenly distributed through the dough. Drop by rounded teaspoons, about 2 inches apart, onto the prepared baking sheets.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are slightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 1 minute before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
