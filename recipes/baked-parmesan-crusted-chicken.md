## Ingredients

- ¾ cup butter
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 cup dry bread crumbs
- ⅓ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano
- ¼ teaspoon pepper
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 6 (4 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Melt the butter with the garlic in a saucepan over medium heat. When the butter starts to bubble, remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly.
