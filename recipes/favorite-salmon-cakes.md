## Ingredients

- 2  eggs, lightly beaten
- 2 tablespoons mayonnaise
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- ½ teaspoon salt, or to taste
- ¼ teaspoon ground white pepper, or to taste
- ½ cup minced red or green bell pepper
- ¼ cup fresh parsley, minced  (Optional)
- ¼ cup minced red onion
- 2 cups cooked salmon fillet, flaked
- 1 cup crushed saltine crackers, divided
- 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
- 1 ½ tablespoons unsalted butter, divided
- 1 sprig fresh parsley  (Optional)
- 6 slices  lemon  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Stir eggs, mayonnaise, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and white pepper together in a large bowl until there are no lumps left. Mix in bell pepper, parsley, and onion. Add salmon; toss gently to preserve some chunks. Add crushed saltines, barely tossing to mix the ingredients.
2. Use a 1/2 cup measuring cup to divide mixture into 12 cakes. Gently press remaining saltine crumbs onto the top and bottom of each cake. Place on a parchment-lined plate, adding parchment in between the layers. Refrigerate for 10 minutes.
3. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil and 1/2 of the butter in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat. Gently place 1/2 of the patties into the heated oil and pan-fry for 4 minutes. Carefully turn and pan-fry an additional 4 minutes. Check for brownness, as you do not want your patties to burn.
4. Wipe out the skillet, add remaining oil and butter, and pan-fry the remaining patties in the same manner. Garnish salmon cakes with fresh parsley and lemon slices.
