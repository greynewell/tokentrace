## Ingredients

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- ½ cup finely chopped pecans
- ½ cup butter or margarine, melted
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, room temperature
- 1 cup confectioners' sugar
- 1 cup frozen whipped topping, thawed
- 2 (3.5 ounce) packages instant coconut cream pudding mix
- 2 cups milk
- 3 cups frozen whipped topping, thawed
- ½ cup chopped pecans

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees F). In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, 1/2 cup pecans and melted butter or margarine. Press into the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven, then chill until cold.
