## Ingredients

- 5 cups bread flour, divided
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 4 (.25 ounce) packages instant yeast
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt
- 1 ½ cups milk
- 1 cup water
- ⅓ cup coconut oil
- 1 tablespoon coconut oil

## Instructions

1. Combine 2 1/2 cups flour, sugar, yeast, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment.
2. Heat milk, water, and 1/3 cup coconut oil in a saucepan until a thermometer inserted into the mixture reads 120 degrees F (49 degrees C), 2 to 3 minutes.
3. Pour milk mixture over flour; beat together on high speed until combined, about 2 minutes. Stir in remaining 2 1/2 cups flour until a soft, sticky dough forms.
4. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes.
5. Place dough in a bowl; cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes.
6. Grease 24 muffin cups. Divide dough into 48 equal-sized balls; place 2 balls into each prepared muffin cup. Cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes.
7. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
8. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Brush tops with 1 tablespoon coconut oil.
