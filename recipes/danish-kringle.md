## Ingredients

- 1 cup butter
- 2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
- 1 cup sour cream
- 1 cup butter, softened
- 2 cups brown sugar
- 1 ½ cups chopped English walnuts, divided
- 1 cup confectioners' sugar
- 2 tablespoons water

## Instructions

1. Sift flour into a large bowl; cut in 1 cup of butter with 2 knives or a pastry blender until mixture is crumbly, leaving pea-sized chunks. Stir in sour cream and mix well to form a sticky dough. Cover dough tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate 8 hours, or overnight.
2. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease or line a baking sheet. Prepare the filling by mixing 1 cup softened butter, brown sugar, and 1 cup chopped walnuts in a bowl until well combined; set aside.
3. Divide dough into three equal parts; return two parts to the refrigerator to keep cold. Quickly form 1/3 of the dough into a rectangle, and flour lightly. On a heavily floured surface, roll out to approximately 12x17 inches. Position lengthwise on the work surface. Along the long edges of the dough rectangle, use a sharp knife to cut 4-inch long angled lines about 1/2 inch apart. Spoon 1/3 of the filling along the length of the rectangle's uncut center. Alternating from one side of the dough to the other, fold each 1/2 inch wide strip towards the center, crisscrossing the filling in a braid-like fashion. Lightly press together the ends of the strips to seal. Sprinkle with 1/3 of the remaining walnuts. Repeat with remaining ingredients to form 3 braids. Arrange braids on the prepared baking sheet.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 30 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for approximately 30 minutes. While the pastries are cooling, prepare the icing: Mix confectioners sugar and water together until smooth and thin enough to drizzle; spoon or drizzle over cooled pastries.
