## Ingredients

- 1 (2 1/2 pound) tenderized round steak, cut into 6 pieces
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 cup all-purpose flour, divided
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder, or to taste
- ½ cup cooking oil, divided
- 1 large onion, sliced
- 1 cup water
- 1 teaspoon beef base (such as Better than Bouillon®)
- 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
- 2 cups milk

## Instructions

1. Sprinkle each side of the round steak pieces with salt and pepper, rubbing seasoning into the meat.
2. Combine 1/2 cup flour and garlic powder in a 1-gallon resealable bag. Add steak pieces, seal bag, and shake to evenly coat all the pieces.
3. Heat 1/3 cup of oil in a large skillet over medium heat until hot. Add seasoned and floured steak pieces to the skillet in a single layer in batches and cook until browned, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Remove from the skillet and keep warm. Repeat with remaining pieces, adding more oil, if necessary, until all are browned.
4. Add onion slices to the same skillet and stir, coating onions with pan drippings, until onion slices have separated and are just beginning to soften, about 2 minutes. Move onions to one side of the skillet and return browned steak pieces to the skillet. Spread steak evenly in the skillet and place onions on top.
5. Stir together water, beef base, and Worcestershire sauce in a microwave-safe container. Microwave on high for 1 minute, stir, and pour into the skillet. Cover, reduce heat to a simmer, and cook until the steak is tender, about 45 minutes.
6. Remove the steak from the skillet and add reserved 1/2 cup of flour to the pan drippings. Increase heat to medium; stir briskly and cook until bubbly, 2 to 3 minutes.
7. Stir in milk and keep stirring until gravy bubbles again. Return steak, onions, and any accumulated juices to the skillet, cover, and reduce heat to a simmer. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until flavors are well combined, about 10 minutes.
