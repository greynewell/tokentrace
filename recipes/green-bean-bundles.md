## Ingredients

- 10 slices bacon
- 1 pound fresh green beans
- 1 cube beef bouillon
- 4 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
- 2 teaspoons soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until partially cooked. Drain, cut each piece in half, and set aside.
3. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Place the green beans on a rack or special steamer basket over the boiling water. Cover with a lid so that the steam does not escape. Steam for a few minutes until the green beans are done. Set the green beans aside. Reserve about 2 cups of the water and dissolve the bouillon cube in it.
4. Take a bundle of green beans (4 or 5) and wrap them with a piece of bacon. Secure with a toothpick if necessary. Place the bundles in a shallow baking dish.
5. In a saucepan over medium heat, combine the reserved stock with the Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, butter, brown sugar, and garlic powder. Stir until the sugar is dissolved.
6. Pour the sauce over the bundles and bake in a preheated 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven for 20 minutes or until the bacon is done.
