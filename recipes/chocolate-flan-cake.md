## Ingredients

- Crisco® Original No-Stick Cooking Spray
- ½ cup SMUCKER'S® Caramel Flavored Topping
- 1 (18.25 ounce) box Pillsbury® Moist Supreme® Devils Food Premium Cake Mix
- 1 cup water
- ½ cup Crisco® Pure Vegetable Oil
- 3  large eggs
- 4 ounces cream cheese, softened
- 4 large eggs, at room temperature
- 1 (14 ounce) can EAGLE BRAND® Sweetened Condensed Milk
- 1 (12 ounce) can PET® Evaporated Milk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a 12-cup fluted tube pan with nonstick spray. Place a piece of rolled-up foil into the tube part of the pan to prevent cake from spilling over the top. Pour caramel topping into the prepared pan.
2. Beat cake mix, water, 3 eggs, and vegetable oil together in a large bowl until well combined; pour evenly over caramel topping.
3. Combine condensed milk, evaporated milk, 4 eggs, cream cheese, and vanilla in a blender. Process until smooth; pour slowly over cake batter. While baking, the cake will rise and the milk mixture will go to the bottom.
4. Coat a piece of foil with nonstick spray. Cover the pan tightly with foil, coated-side down. Place the pan in a large roasting pan. Pour hot water into the roasting pan to a depth of 2 inches.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with a few moist crumbs on it, about 2 hours.
6. Place cake on a cooling rack; cool for 15 minutes. Remove foil and invert onto a serving plate. Cool for 1 hour at room temperature. Chill for 4 hours or overnight before serving.
