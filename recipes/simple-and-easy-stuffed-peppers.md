## Ingredients

- 1 ¼ pounds ground beef
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1  onion, diced
- 1 (15.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
- 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
- 1 ½ cups chicken broth
- 6  red bell peppers

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in the ground beef, and cook until brown and crumbly. Pour off excess grease, then stir in garlic, onion, and tomatoes. Cook and stir until the onions soften just a bit, about 3 minutes. Stir the cheese into the mixture, and set aside.
