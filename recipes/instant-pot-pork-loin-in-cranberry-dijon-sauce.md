## Ingredients

- 1 pound boneless pork loin roast
- salt and pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1 (14 ounce) can whole cranberry sauce
- ½  yellow onion, sliced
- 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh tarragon
- 1 packet dry onion soup mix
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch

## Instructions

1. Pat pork loin dry and season on all sides with salt and pepper.
2. Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and select Saute function. Add butter and let melt. Add pork loin and cook on all sides until just a little bit of color shows, about 1 minute per side. Turn off Saute function and add cranberry sauce, sliced onion, Dijon mustard, tarragon, and dry onion mix. Gently combine and spoon some of the sauce over the pork loin.
3. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturers' instructions; set timer for 9 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
4. Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 10 minutes. Check internal temperature of the pork loin; an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 180 degrees F (82 degrees C). Temperature will continue to rise slightly after the pork loin is removed from pot.
5. Place on a cutting board to allow to rest for 8 to 10 minutes before cutting into thin slices.
6. While pork loin is resting, select Saute function again and stir cornstarch into sauce. Whisk until sauce thickens, 2 to 5 minutes. Serve pork loin with cranberry-Dijon sauce.
