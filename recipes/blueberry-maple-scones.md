## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- ½ cup white sugar
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup frozen blueberries
- ½ cup white chocolate chips
- ½ cup heavy cream
- 1 large egg
- ½ teaspoon maple extract
- ½ cup unsalted butter, frozen
- 3 tablespoons heavy cream
- 1 cup confectioners' sugar
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 tablespoon milk, or more as needed

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Add frozen blueberries and white chocolate chips; stir until evenly distributed and blueberries are coated.
3. Whisk 1/2 cup heavy cream, egg, and maple extract together in a small bowl.
4. Remove butter from the freezer and grate onto a plate with a box grater. (I recommend using the biggest size grating side.) Add butter to the flour mixture and toss a couple of times to evenly distribute and cover the butter pieces. Drizzle cream-egg mixture over the flour mixture while stirring. Continue tossing until incorporated, about 30 seconds; dough will be shaggy at this point. Work dough with your hands until it forms a single mass.
5. Lift and place dough onto a lightly floured surface. Shape into a 1-inch thick circle. Use a knife or scraper to cut dough into 8 triangular-shaped pieces.
6. Place scones onto the prepared baking sheet, about 1/2 inch to 1 inch apart. Brush the tops with remaining 3 tablespoons heavy cream.
7. Bake in the preheated oven until tops are golden brown, about 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool until they can be handled but are still warm, 5 to 10 minutes.
8. Meanwhile, combine confectioners' sugar and vanilla in a bowl. Slowly add milk, stirring until you get a drizzling consistency.
9. Drizzle glaze over the warm scones, back and forth in a zig-zag pattern. Arrange scones on a dish and allow glaze to set for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.
