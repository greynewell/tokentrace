## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups chopped cremini mushrooms
- ¼ cup minced shallots
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- ¾ tablespoon chopped fresh thyme
- ½ teaspoon sea salt, or to taste
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 ½ tablespoons olive oil
- ¼ cup full-bodied dry red wine, or as needed
- 1 pound lean ground chuck
- 1 ¾ tablespoons white truffle oil
- 1  baguette, cut into 1-inch slices
- 12 thin slices  Parmesan cheese
- 1 ½ cups arugula

## Instructions

1. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
2. Stir mushrooms, shallots, garlic, thyme, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat;cook and stir mushroom mixture until golden, about 8 minutes. Pour red wine into skillet; simmer until liquid evaporates, stirring slowly, about 2 minutes. Spread mushroom mixture onto a plate to cool to room temperature, about 5 minutes.
3. Crumble ground chuck into a bowl; pour truffle oil over beef and massage oil gently into beef until evenly distributed. Fold mushroom mixture into beef mixture until combined; form 6 patties approximately the size of baguette slices.
4. Grill patties until no longer pink in the center, about 3 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
5. Toast baguette slices until crisp and golden. Place each patty on a baguette slice, top with 2 shaved slices of Parmesan cheese, about 1/4 cup arugula, and a second baguette slice. Secure each slider with a toothpick.
