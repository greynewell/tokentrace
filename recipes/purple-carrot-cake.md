## Ingredients

- butter
- 9 ounces purple carrots, finely grated
- ½ cup brown sugar
- ½ cup white sugar
- 1 teaspoon lemon zest
- 1 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 3  eggs
- ½ cup unsweetened applesauce
- ¼ cup light vegetable oil
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon purple food coloring  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with butter.
2. Combine grated carrots, brown sugar sugar, white sugar, and lemon zest in a bowl. Toss to coat and allow the natural juices to come out. Set aside.
3. Mix flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a separate bowl.
4. Whisk eggs, applesauce, oil, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl. Add flour mixture 1/4 cup at a time, mixing until just combined. Fold in carrot-sugar mixture with all the juice that has accumulated. Add food coloring. Pour batter into the prepared baking dish.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes.
6. Cool cake on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Run a table knife around the edges of the pan to loosen. Invert cake carefully onto a serving plate or cooling rack. Let cool completely.
