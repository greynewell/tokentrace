## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon active dry yeast
- 2 cups warm water (100 to 110 degrees F/40 to 45 degrees C)
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 2  eggs, beaten
- ¼ cup vegetable oil
- 5 ½ cups all-purpose flour, or more if needed
- 2 tablespoons poultry seasoning
- 2 tablespoons dried savory
- 1 ½ tablespoons ground dried sage
- 1 tablespoon dried dill weed  (Optional)
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon ground nutmeg  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Mix yeast, warm water, sugar, salt, eggs, and vegetable oil together in a large bowl. In another bowl, whisk together the flour, poultry seasoning, savory, sage, dill, black pepper, and nutmeg until thoroughly combined. Beat the flour mixture into the wet ingredients, about 1 cup at a time, until the dough is smooth; add up to 1 more cup of flour if needed.
2. Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface, and knead until the dough is springy, smooth, and elastic, about 8 minutes. Form the dough into a ball, and place into an oiled bowl. Turn the dough ball around in the bowl to lightly oil the dough, then cover the bowl with a cloth and let the dough rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
3. Grease 2 9x5-inch loaf pans. Punch down the dough, knead several times to remove air pockets, then cut the dough in half. Shape each half into a log, pinching the seams closed, then place into the prepared loaf pans seam sides down. Lightly cover the pans with a cloth, and let rise until doubled, 45 minutes to 1 hour.
4. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
5. Bake the bread until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes; remove from pans and cool on wire cooling racks.
