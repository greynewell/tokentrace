## Ingredients

- ½ cup butter
- 1 large onion, chopped
- ¾ pound fresh mushrooms, sliced
- 1 pound beef sirloin, cut into 1-inch cubes
- 1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed beef consomme with gelatin added, divided
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 3 tablespoons ketchup
- 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
- 1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
- ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste
- 3 dashes hot pepper sauce (such as Tabasco®), or to taste
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 (8 ounce) container sour cream

## Instructions

1. Melt butter in a large heavy pot over medium-high heat; cook and stir onion until softened, about 5 minutes.
2. Stir in mushrooms and continue to cook and stir until mushrooms are soft and liquid has evaporated, about 5 more minutes.

4. Cook and stir beef sirloin cubes in the same skillet over medium heat until the cubes are browned on all sides and liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes.

6. Bring mixture to a boil; set remaining consomme aside.
7. Mix in garlic, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, salt, black pepper, and hot sauce.
8. Reduce heat to low and simmer beef mixture until tender, at least 30 minutes.
9. Simmer longer for more tender beef.
10. Whisk remaining 1/3 can beef consomme with flour in a small bowl until smooth; stir into the beef mixture, return to a boil, and simmer the meat and sauce until thickened, 2 to 3 more minutes.
