## Ingredients

- 2 cups shelled fresh peas
- ¾ pound new or red potatoes, unpeeled, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- ½ cup low-sodium vegetable or chicken broth
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
- 1 tablespoon thinly sliced fresh mint

## Instructions

1. Put peas in a bowl.
2. Place potatoes in a pot and cover with lightly salted cold water. Bring to a boil; cook until crisp-tender, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain, pouring enough hot cooking liquid over peas to cover. Let peas stand 30 seconds, then drain and rinse peas under cold water.
3. Melt butter in a large skillet over high heat. Add peas, potatoes, broth, and salt. Cook, stirring, until liquid reduces to a glaze, 5 to 7 minutes.
4. Stir in parsley and mint.
