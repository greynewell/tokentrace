## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon salted butter
- 2 slices bacon, chopped
- 4 (6 ounce) bone-in center-cut pork chops (about 1 inch thick)
- ½ cup honey
- ¼ cup soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic
- ½ cup cold water
- 2 teaspoons cornstarch

## Instructions

1. Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and select Saute function. Add butter and bacon; saute until bacon is cooked but not quite crispy, about 5 minutes. Add pork chops and sear for about 1 minute on each side. Gently stir in honey, soy sauce, and garlic.
2. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 10 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
3. Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Transfer pork chops to a plate and switch back to Saute function.
4. Whisk cold water and cornstarch together in a small bowl; pour into the pot. Cook and stir until sauce thickens, about 5 minutes. Pour sauce over pork chops.
