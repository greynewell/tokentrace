## Ingredients

- 3  onions, coarsely chopped
- 1 stick butter, melted
- ¼ cup chicken broth
- 2 tablespoons minced garlic
- 1 tablespoon poultry seasoning
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ teaspoon paprika
- ½ teaspoon smoked paprika
- 4  skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut in half
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 (24 ounce) container sour cream

## Instructions

1. Place onions into the bottom of a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot). Pour melted butter and broth on top.
2. Mix garlic, poultry seasoning, salt, pepper, paprika, and smoked paprika together in a small bowl. Stir into onions. Place chicken on top of the onions.
3. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 9 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
4. Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, 10 to 40 minutes.
5. Transfer chicken and onions to a plate. Select Sauté function to bring juices to a simmer, about 5 minutes.
6. Sift flour into the pot and stir until no lumps remain and sauce has thickened a bit, about 5 minutes. Add sour cream by the spoonful, stirring to incorporate. Cancel Sauté function. Return chicken and onions to the pot. Select Warm function to heat through, about 5 minutes. Serve.
