## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 5 tablespoons unsalted butter, cubed
- ¾ cup reduced-fat vanilla yogurt
- 1  egg, beaten
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 tablespoon milk
- 1 tablespoon white sugar

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray.
2. Mix flour, 1/4 cup sugar, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Add butter and mix with fingers until coarse crumbs form. Gently mix yogurt, egg, and vanilla extract into flour mixture until dough is just combined.
