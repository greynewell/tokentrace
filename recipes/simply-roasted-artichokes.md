## Ingredients

- 4 large whole artichokes, top 1 inch and stems removed
- ¼ cup fresh lemon juice
- ¼ cup olive oil
- 4 cloves garlic, cloves peeled and crushed
- kosher salt

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Place artichokes stem-side down in a bowl and drizzle with lemon juice.
3. Slightly separate the artichoke leaves with your hands. Insert a knife blade into the center of each artichoke to create a garlic clove-size space. Drizzle each artichoke with olive oil and press 1 clove of garlic into the center of each artichoke; season with salt.
4. Tightly wrap each artichoke twice with heavy-duty aluminum foil; place in a baking dish.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until sizzling, about 1 hour 20 minutes
