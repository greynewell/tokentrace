## Instructions

1. Combine ketchup, brown sugar, and cider vinegar in a bowl; mix well.

Add ground beef, pork, and veal. With gloved hands, work all ingredients together until completely mixed and uniform.
5. Divide meatloaf mixture in half and pat half of mixture into each prepared loaf pan. Brush loaves with half of the glaze; set remainder of glaze aside.
6. Bake in preheated oven for 50 minutes. Remove pans from oven; carefully drain fat. Brush loaves with remaining glaze. Return to oven and bake for 10 minutes more. Remove pans from oven and allow meatloaf to stand for 15 minutes before slicing.
