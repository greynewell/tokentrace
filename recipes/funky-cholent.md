## Ingredients

- 2 teaspoons vegetable oil
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, chopped
- 1 pound beef stew meat, cubed
- 5 large potatoes, cubed
- 1  sweet potato, cubed
- 1 (16 ounce) can baked beans
- 1 tablespoon ketchup
- 1 tablespoon barbecue sauce
- 1 tablespoon prepared yellow mustard
- 2 teaspoons dry onion soup mix
- 2 teaspoons seasoned salt
- 1 teaspoon steak seasoning

## Instructions

1. Heat the oil in a large soup pot over medium heat; cook and stir the onion and garlic until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes.
