## Ingredients

- ½ cup milk
- 1 cup soft bread crumbs
- 1 ½ pounds ground beef
- 1 ¼ teaspoons salt
- ground black pepper to taste
- 1  egg, slightly beaten
- 3 tablespoons steak sauce, (e.g. Heinz 57)
- 1  onion, chopped
- ½ cup diced green bell pepper
- ¼ cup steak sauce, or more to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8x4-inch loaf pan. Combine bread crumbs and milk in a small bowl; set aside to soften.
2. Mix ground beef, onion, bell pepper, steak sauce, egg, salt, and black pepper in a large bowl; add bread crumb mixture and mix with your hands until combined.
3. Pat the mixture into the prepared loaf pan; brush the top with 1/4 cup steak sauce.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Allow to stand for 5 minutes before slicing.
