## Ingredients

- ⅓ cup balsamic vinegar
- ½ cup chicken broth
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon dried Italian herb seasoning
- 4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- 1 tablespoon olive oil

## Instructions

1. Whisk together chicken broth, balsamic vinegar, sugar, Italian seasoning, and garlic in a bowl. Place chicken breasts in marinade; let marinate for 10 minutes on each side.
2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Remove chicken from marinade; reserve marinade. Place chicken in the hot skillet and cook until browned and no longer pink inside, about 7 minutes per side.
3. Pour marinade into the skillet. Cook until sauce thickens slightly, turning chicken breasts over once or twice, about 5 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a chicken breast should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
