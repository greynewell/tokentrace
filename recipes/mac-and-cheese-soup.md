## Ingredients

- 3 slices bacon, chopped  (Optional)
- 1 teaspoon bacon drippings
- 1 (7 ounce) package elbow macaroni
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- ¼ teaspoon minced garlic, or to taste
- 2 (14 ounce) cans chicken broth
- 1 (16 ounce) jar cheese sauce (such as Ragu® Double Cheddar)
- 2 tablespoons chicken bouillon granules
- 2 teaspoons ground red chili pepper, or to taste
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 pinch crushed red pepper flakes, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Place the chopped bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, 5 to 8 minutes.
2. Drain the bacon on a paper towel-lined plate.
3. Reserve 1 teaspoon of the bacon drippings.
4. Fill a pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat.
5. Once the water is boiling, stir in the macaroni, and return to a boil.
6. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes.
7. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.
8. Heat reserved bacon drippings in a large saucepan over medium heat, and cook the onion until translucent, about 5 minutes; stir in the garlic, and cook until the garlic is softened, about 2 more minutes.
9. Mix in bacon bits, chicken broth, cheese sauce, chicken bouillon granules, ground red chili pepper, black pepper, crushed red pepper flakes, and cooked macaroni.
10. Bring to a boil and reduce heat to a simmer; cook, stirring occasionally, until the flavors have blended, about 5 minutes.
