## Ingredients

- ½ cup eggnog
- ⅛ cup butter
- ⅛ cup pumpkin puree
- ½ cup water
- 4 cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed
- ½ cup white sugar
- 1  egg
- 1 ½ teaspoons active dry yeast
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ cup dark brown sugar
- 3 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 1 ½ teaspoons ground nutmeg
- 1 teaspoon ground cloves
- ½ teaspoon ground allspice
- ⅛ cup melted butter
- 1 cup confectioners' sugar
- ½ (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- ¼ cup pumpkin puree
- ¼ teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 ½ tablespoons eggnog

## Instructions

1. Warm 1/2 cup eggnog in a small saucepan over low heat until it bubbles, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and mix in 1/8 cup butter and 1/8 cup pumpkin; stir until melted. Add water and let mixture cool until lukewarm, about 5 minutes.
2. Combine cooled eggnog mixture, 1 cup flour, white sugar, egg, yeast, and salt in a large bowl. Stir well to combine. Stir in remaining flour 1 cup at a time, beating well after each addition with an electric mixer until dough has pulled together. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.
3. Roll dough into a 12x9-inch rectangle.
4. Combine brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and allspice together in a bowl. Spread melted butter on top of dough and top with brown sugar mixture. Roll dough into a log, using a little water to seal the seam.
5. Cut roll into 12 slices using a very sharp knife or a piece of unflavored dental floss. Place rolls into a 9x13-inch greased baking pan. Cover and let rise until almost doubled in size, about 1 hour.
6. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
7. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.
8. Meanwhile, combine confectioners' sugar, cream cheese, 1/4 cup pumpkin, and vanilla extract in a bowl. Add eggnog gradually until frosting reaches a spreadable consistency. Spread frosting over warm cinnamon rolls.
