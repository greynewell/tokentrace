## Ingredients

- 1 ½ tablespoons salted butter
- 1 ½ tablespoons olive oil
- 2 medium carrots, sliced
- 1 large stalk celery, diced
- ½ large onion, diced
- ½ pound diced cooked ham
- 1  potato, peeled and diced
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 4 cups chicken broth, divided
- ½ pound dried split peas
- 2  bay leaves
- ¼ cup shredded Cheddar cheese, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®), and select Saute function. Add butter and olive oil; heat until butter is melted. Add carrots, celery, and onion; cook until onion is nearly translucent, about 3 minutes. Add ham and cook for 1 minute.
2. Add potato; cook and stir to prevent anything from sticking to the bottom of the pot, for 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add 3 cups chicken broth, split peas, and bay leaves. Turn Saute function off.
3. Close and lock the lid and seal the valve. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 15 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
4. Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, 10 to 12 minutes. Release remaining pressure carefully using the quick-release method, 2 to 3 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid.
5. Unlock and remove the lid. Taste and adjust with salt and pepper as desired. If soup is too thick, select Saute function and add remaining 1 cup chicken broth. Stir until heated through and desired consistency, about 5 minutes. Adjust seasonings if necessary. Serve immediately with Cheddar cheese sprinkled over top.
