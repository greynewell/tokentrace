## Ingredients

- 5 cups chicken stock
- 3 ½ cups peeled and diced sweet potatoes
- ¾ cup diced cooked ham
- ⅓ cup diced celery
- ⅓ cup finely chopped onion
- ½ cup chopped green bell pepper
- ¼ cup chopped carrot
- ¼ cup corn
- 1 tablespoon chopped garlic
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- 1 teaspoon dried parsley flakes
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 5 tablespoons butter
- 6 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 2 cups milk

## Instructions

1. Combine chicken stock, sweet potatoes, ham, celery, and onion in a stockpot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and cook until sweet potatoes are tender, 10 to 15 minutes.

Slowly stir milk into butter-flour mixture until completely smooth; continue cooking and stirring over medium-low heat until thickened, 4 to 5 more minutes.
