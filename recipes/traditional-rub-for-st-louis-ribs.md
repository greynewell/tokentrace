## Ingredients

- ¼ cup dark brown sugar
- 3 tablespoons paprika
- 1 tablespoon dry mustard
- 1 tablespoon sea salt
- 1 ½ teaspoons granulated garlic powder
- 1 ½ teaspoons onion powder
- ½ teaspoon ground coriander
- 2 racks Smithfield® Extra Tender St. Louis Pork Spareribs, membrane removed
- 1 tablespoon Vegetable oil
- 1 cup Handful hickory or apple wood chips for smoking, soaked in water and drained
- ¾ cup apple juice, in a spray bottle

## Instructions

1. About one hour before smoking, make the dry rub. Combine sugar, paprika, mustard, salt, garlic, onion powder and coriander in small bowl; mix well. Coat both sides of ribs with a little vegetable oil and sprinkle with seasoning rub. Set aside at room temperature for 1 hour.
2. Heat charcoal or gas grill for indirect cooking at 230 to 250 degrees F. Add drained wood chips, if using.
3. Place the ribs, meaty side down, over a drip pan and cook for 2 hours. If desired, spray both sides of ribs with apple juice. Add about 12 coals to a charcoal grill every 45 minutes or so to maintain the heat.
4. Remove ribs from grill. Double-wrap each rack in heavy-duty aluminum foil. Return wrapped ribs to the grill and cook for 1 1/2 to 3 hours more over indirect heat, until very tender. Add more coals as needed to maintain temperature for a charcoal grill.
