## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- fresh ground black pepper to taste
- 1 cup maple syrup
- 1 ½ pounds pork tenderloin

## Instructions

1. Combine mustard, sesame oil, garlic, pepper, and maple syrup. Place pork in a shallow dish and coat thoroughly with marinade. Cover, then chill in the refrigerator at least eight hours, or overnight.
2. Preheat grill for medium-low heat.
3. Remove pork from marinade, and set aside. Transfer remaining marinade to a small saucepan, and cook on the stove over medium-low heat for 5 minutes.
