## Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
- 4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1  red onion, minced
- 2 tablespoons lime juice
- 1  avocado, diced
- Salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Stir 1 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, and cayenne pepper together in a small bowl; rub evenly into the chicken breasts.
2. Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook the chicken in the heated oil until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 5 to 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
