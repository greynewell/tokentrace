## Ingredients

- 2 ½ cups bleached all-purpose flour
- ¼ cup cornstarch
- 4 teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 2 teaspoons ground ginger
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ½ teaspoon ground allspice
- ½ teaspoon ground cloves
- 1 cup milk
- 3  large eggs
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 cup unsalted butter, softened until easily spreadable
- 2 cups dark brown sugar

## Instructions

1. Adjust the oven rack to the middle position; preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and lightly flour a metal or disposable foil 9x13-inch pan.
2. Whisk flour, cornstarch, baking powder, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, cloves, and salt in a large bowl. Mix milk, eggs, and vanilla extract in a 2-cup measuring cup.
3. Beat softened butter into flour mixture in a large bowl with an electric mixer, first on low, then medium, until mixture forms pebble-sized pieces. Add about 1/3 of the milk mixture and beat on low until smooth. Add remaining milk mixture in two stages; beat on medium speed until batter is just smooth. Add brown sugar; beat until just incorporated, about 30 seconds. Pour batter into the prepared pan.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Cool briefly on a wire rack, then run a table knife around the edges to loosen. Invert carefully onto a serving plate or cooling rack. Let cool completely.
