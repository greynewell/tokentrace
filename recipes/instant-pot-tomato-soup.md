## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 4 stalks celery, chopped
- 1 cup chopped carrot
- 1 small yellow onion, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, chopped
- 4 cups vegetable broth
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can fire-roasted diced tomatoes
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can crushed San Marzano tomatoes
- 3 tablespoons tomato paste
- 2 teaspoons dried basil
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ¼ cup butter
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- 1 cup milk
- ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 tablespoon raw cane sugar  (Optional)
- 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and select Saute function. Add olive oil, celery, carrot, onion, and garlic. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
2. Stir in vegetable broth, diced and crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, basil, salt, and pepper. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 6 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
3. Meanwhile, melt butter in a small saucepan over low heat. Stir in flour until a smooth, thick paste forms, about 3 minutes.
4. Release pressure naturally for 2 minutes according to manufacturer's instructions. Release remaining pressure by opening the valve to vent.
5. Use an immersion blender to carefully puree the hot soup. Select Saute function again; set timer for 3 minutes. Add flour paste, stirring continuously. Add milk, Parmesan cheese, sugar, and red pepper flakes. Season with more salt and pepper if needed. Stir to combine until the timer ends.
