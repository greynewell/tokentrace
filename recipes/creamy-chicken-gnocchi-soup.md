## Ingredients

- ¼ cup butter
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 large zucchini, diced
- 2 stalks celery, diced
- 1  yellow onion, diced
- ½  red bell pepper, diced
- 2  carrots, shredded
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- 3 cups chicken broth, or more as needed
- 1 cup half-and-half
- 1 pint fat-free half-and-half
- 2 cups shredded rotisserie chicken meat
- 1 (16 ounce) package small gnocchi
- 2 cups torn fresh spinach
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ½ teaspoon ground thyme
- ¼ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg

## Instructions

1. Melt butter with olive oil in a large soup pot over medium heat. Cook and stir zucchini, celery, onion, red bell pepper, carrots, and garlic in the hot butter and oil until vegetables are soft, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir flour into mixture, coating vegetables; cook 2 more minutes.
2. Stir chicken broth into vegetables, stirring until flour paste combines with broth and soup is thick and smooth, about 5 minutes. Pour in both kinds of half-and-half; bring to a simmer. Cook until slightly thickened, about 5 more minutes. Gently fold chicken, gnocchi, and spinach into soup. Season with salt, black pepper, thyme, and nutmeg. Adjust thickness by adding more chicken broth, if desired.
