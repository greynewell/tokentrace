## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- 4  eggs
- 1 cup chocolate milk
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 cup finely shredded coconut
- 1 cup quick-cooking oats
- ¼ cup chocolate chips, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin.
2. Mix flour, baking powder, and baking soda together in a small bowl.
3. Beat eggs in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until light and frothy, about 3 minutes. Add chocolate milk, sugar, coconut, and oats; beat until thoroughly combined, about 2 minutes. Slowly add flour mixture to the bowl and beat together until no lumps remain in batter.
4. Scoop batter into muffin cups, filling each 2/3 of the way full. Sprinkle a few chocolate chips on top of each muffin.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool, about 25 minutes, before transferring to a serving plate.
