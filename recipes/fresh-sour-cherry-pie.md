## Ingredients

- 1 (9 inch) prepared double-crust pie pastry
- 4 cups pitted sour cherries
- ⅔ cup white sugar
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1  orange, zested and juiced
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1  egg white
- 1 teaspoon milk

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Press the bottom pie crust into a lightly greased 9-inch pie pan.
2. Combine cherries, sugar, flour, orange zest, orange juice, and cinnamon in a medium bowl.
3. Place cherry mixture into the bottom pie crust and add butter in a few small dollops on the top. Place the top pie crust over in a woven lattice design or leave it whole, being sure to cut a few slits in the top to allow steam to escape.
4. Mix egg white and milk together in a small bowl and brush over the top of the pie.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until the top has a golden brown sheen, 40 to 50 minutes. Let cool thoroughly before serving.
