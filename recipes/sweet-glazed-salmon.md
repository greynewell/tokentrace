## Ingredients

- ¼ teaspoon olive oil
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- ¼ cup soy sauce
- ½  lemon, juiced
- 1 teaspoon honey
- ½ teaspoon olive oil
- ⅓ teaspoon packed brown sugar
- ¼ teaspoon sea salt, plus more for garnish
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper, plus more for garnish
- ¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 4 (6 ounce) fillets salmon
- 1 tablespoon olive oil

## Instructions

1. Heat 1/4 teaspoon olive oil in a small skillet over medium-high heat. Sauté garlic in hot oil until just beginning to brown.
2. Mix together sautéed garlic, brown sugar, soy sauce, lemon juice, honey, 1/2 teaspoon olive oil, sea salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes in a bowl; pour into a large resealable plastic bag. Add salmon fillets to the bag, turning to coat with marinade, squeeze to remove excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 1 hour.
3. Remove salmon from the marinade and shake to remove excess liquid. Reserve 3 tablespoons marinade and discard remainder.
4. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Arrange salmon fillets in the hot skillet; pour reserved marinade over salmon. Cover and cook, occasionally spooning liquid in the pan over fillets, until salmon is browned and flakes easily with a fork, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Garnish salmon with sea salt and black pepper.
