## Ingredients

- ½ cup all-purpose flour
- ground black pepper to taste
- 1 pinch paprika, or to taste
- 1 pinch garlic powder, or to taste
- 1 pinch onion powder, or to taste
- 3 pounds chuck roast
- ¼ cup butter
- 1 (10.75 ounce) can  condensed beef consomme
- 1 cup water
- 1 ½ (1 ounce) envelopes dry onion soup mix
- 5 cloves garlic, peeled
- 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
- 2  carrots, chopped, or to taste
- ¼  onion, chopped, or to taste
- 3  mushrooms, sliced, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
2. Whisk flour, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, and black pepper together in a bowl. Dredge roast in flour mixture to evenly coat.
3. Melt butter in a large pot over medium-high heat; brown roast in melted butter, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer roast to an oven bag and place into a 13x9-inch casserole dish.
4. Whisk condensed beef consomme, water, garlic, onion soup mix, and Worcestershire sauce together in a bowl; pour into the oven bag over the roast. Seal the bag and cut 6 small slits in the top of the oven bag for ventilation.
5. Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour 45 minutes; add carrots, mushrooms, and onion to the oven bag and bake until vegetables are tender and roast is cooked through, about 45 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
