## Ingredients

- 2  eggs
- ⅔ cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 cup sugar
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 pinch salt
- ½ cup chocolate chips  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Cream together eggs, olive oil, and sugar in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and pale gold in color. Add flour, baking powder, and salt and mix until just combined. Fold in chocolate chips. Shape dough into a ball and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
3. Use a teaspoon to drop spoonfuls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving about 2 inches of space in between as cookies will spread. Refrigerate leftover dough to bake in batches.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until just golden around the edges, about 8 minutes. Allow to cool for 2 minutes on the baking sheet before transferring to a cooling rack.
