## Ingredients

- ½  red bell pepper

## Instructions

1. Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
2. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
3. Place the pepper, cut-side down, on the prepared baking sheet.
4. Cook pepper under the preheated broiler until pepper skin blackens and blisters, 5 to 8 minutes.

6. Allow the pepper to steam as it cools, about 20 minutes.
7. Remove and discard skin; thinly slice pepper.
8. Stir mashed potatoes, egg, bread crumbs, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl until smooth.
9. Heat olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat.

12. Flip and cook until golden and crispy on the other side, 5 to 7 minutes more.
13. Wipe skillet clean with a paper towel.
14. Place scallops in a bowl and season olive oil, cayenne pepper, and salt.
15. Heat the same nonstick skillet over high heat.
16. Place scallops in the center of the skillet; place red peppers in a pile in the side of the skillet.
17. Cook scallops until a golden crust develops, 3 to 4 minutes.
18. Transfer scallops to a plate, leaving peppers in the skillet.
19. Cook and stir peppers, basil, butter, and capers together in the hot skillet; pour water into skillet, stir sauce, and remove from heat.
