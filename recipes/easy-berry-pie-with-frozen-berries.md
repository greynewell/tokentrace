## Ingredients

- 1 (15 ounce) package pastry for a 9-inch double-crust pie
- 8 cups frozen mixed berries
- ½ cup white sugar
- ¼ cup cornstarch
- ¼ cup berry-flavored liqueur (such as Whidbey)  (Optional)
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon half-and-half
- 1 large egg yolk

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a 9-inch pie plate with 1 of the pie crusts.
2. Combine berries, sugar, cornstarch, liqueur, and lemon juice in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir occasionally as berries thaw and mixture thickens, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat when it reaches the consistency of runny jam or sundae fruit topping.
3. Pour mixture into pie crust. Moisten the edge of crust with cold water, top with second crust, and seal by pinching. Poke at least 3 holes in top crust.
4. Whip half-and-half and egg yolk together in a bowl with a fork. Brush over pie crust. Place pie on a baking sheet.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden, 20 to 25 minutes. Allow to cool so filling becomes solid, about 1 hour.
