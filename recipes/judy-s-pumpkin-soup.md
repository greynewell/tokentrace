## Ingredients

- ¼ cup butter
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 1  leek, white portion only, chopped
- 4 cups chicken broth
- 1 (29 ounce) can pumpkin puree
- 1 teaspoon curry powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground white pepper
- ¼ teaspoon ground ginger
- 1 teaspoon bay leaf
- 1 cup half-and-half

## Instructions

1. Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and leek in melted butter until onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add chicken broth, pumpkin puree, curry powder, salt, white pepper, ground ginger, and bay leaf to onion mixture; bring to a boil.
2. Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes. Remove from heat to cool. Pour broth mixture into a blender no more than half full. Cover and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth. Return pureed mixture to pot and bring to a boil.
3. Gradually stir half-and-half into pumpkin mixture; cook until soup is heated through, 5 to 10 minutes.
