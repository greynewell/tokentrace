## Ingredients

- 10  ripe tomatoes
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1  onion, chopped
- 1  green bell pepper, chopped
- 2  carrots, chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- ¼ cup chopped fresh basil
- ¼ teaspoon Italian seasoning
- ¼ cup Burgundy wine
- 1  bay leaf
- 2 stalks celery
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Prepare a large bowl of ice water.
2. Plunge whole tomatoes in boiling water until skin starts to peel, about 1 minute. Remove with a slotted spoon and place in ice bath. Let rest until cool enough to handle, then remove peels and squeeze out seeds.
3. Chop 8 tomatoes and puree them in a blender or food processor until smooth. Chop remaining 2 tomatoes and set aside.
4. Heat butter and oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add carrots, onion, bell pepper, and garlic; cook and stir until onion softens, about 5 minutes. Pour in pureed tomatoes, then stir in chopped tomatoes, wine, basil, and Italian seasoning. Place celery stalks and bay leaf in the pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 2 hours.
5. Stir in tomato paste; simmer for an additional 2 hours. Discard celery and bay leaf and serve.
