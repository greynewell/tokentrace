## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- ½ cup brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon, divided
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ¾ teaspoon kosher salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1 cup whole milk
- ½ cup drained crushed pineapple
- 1  egg
- ¼ cup butter, melted
- 1 cup grated carrots, packed
- ½ cup sweetened flaked coconut
- vegetable oil for cooking
- ⅓ cup white sugar
- ½ cup cream cheese, softened
- 1 tablespoon butter, softened
- 1 cup confectioners' sugar
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 pinch salt

## Instructions

1. Whisk flour, brown sugar, baking powder, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, baking soda, and 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt together in a large bowl.
2. Combine milk, crushed pineapple, and egg in a small bowl. Stir into the flour mixture. Add melted butter; mix until a soft dough forms. Fold in carrots and coconut.
3. Heat at least 2 inches of oil in a large pot to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a wire rack or baking sheet with paper towels.
4. Scoop a few tablespoons of dough into the hot oil using a small ice cream scoop. Fry donut holes until golden brown, about 1 minute per side. Transfer donut holes to the paper towels using a slotted spoon; let drain and cool slightly. Repeat with remaining dough.
5. Whisk white sugar and remaining 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon in a shallow bowl. Roll donut holes in sugar mixture.
6. Beat cream cheese and 1 tablespoon butter together in a bowl until smooth. Beat in confectioners' sugar until dip is well-blended and fluffy. Stir in vanilla extract and 1 pinch salt. Serve donut holes with cream cheese dip.
