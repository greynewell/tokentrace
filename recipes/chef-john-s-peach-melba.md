## Ingredients

- 3 cups fresh or frozen raspberries
- ⅓ cup white sugar
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice

- 2 cups white sugar
- 2 cups water
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 1  vanilla bean, split lengthwise
- 3  peaches, halved and pitted

## Instructions

1. Combine raspberries, 1/3 cup sugar, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, water, and balsamic vinegar in a saucepan over medium heat.

3. Place peach halves with cut sides up in the syrup and simmer until tender, 5 to 8 minutes per side, basting with the syrup occasionally. Remove from heat and allow to cool in the syrup. Transfer to a bowl, cover, and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, about 4 hours.
