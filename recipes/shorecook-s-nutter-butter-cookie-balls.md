## Ingredients

- 16 ounces peanut butter sandwich cookies (such as Nutter Butter®)
- ½ (16 ounce) jar peanut butter (such as Jif®)
- ½ (24 ounce) package chocolate candy melts
- ¼ cup multicolored candy sprinkles

## Instructions

1. Cover a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.
2. Crush peanut butter cookies in a food processor until they are crumbs. Pour into the bowl of a stand mixer and add peanut butter. Mix on medium speed until a dough forms, about 5 minutes.
3. Scoop dough and form 20 balls, placing them onto the prepared baking sheet. Freeze for 30 minutes so they will hold together while dipping.
4. Melt chocolate candy in a microwave-safe bowl in a microwave, stirring frequently, in 30-second increments.
5. Insert a toothpick into each cookie ball and dip into melted chocolate. Return balls to the prepared baking sheet and top with sprinkles.
