## Ingredients

- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup butter, softened
- 1 cup packed brown sugar
- 1 cup white sugar
- 2  eggs
- 3 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 (13 ounce) jar chocolate-hazelnut spread (such as Nutella®)

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 12 mini muffin cups.
2. Combine flour, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl. Set aside.
3. Beat butter, brown sugar, and white sugar together using an electric mixer in a mixing bowl until smooth and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Beat in eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add vanilla extract until fully incorporated. Add flour mixture and mix until dough is just combined.
4. Roll dough into 1 1/2-inch balls. Press each down into a prepared mini muffin cup.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and not too dark around the edges, 10 to 13 minutes. Remove from the oven and let sit for 2 minutes.
6. Make wells in each cookie cup for chocolate-hazelnut spread using a spoon. Add 1 tablespoon chocolate-hazelnut spread to each cookie cup. Let cool 15 to 20 minutes before removing from the muffin cups.
