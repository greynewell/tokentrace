## Ingredients

- ½ cup unsalted butter
- ½ cup all-purpose flour
- 1 quart cold chicken stock
- ⅓ cup heavy cream
- salt and ground white pepper to taste
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper

## Instructions

1. Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Gradually whisk in flour, reduce heat to low, and stir until the roux has turned golden and smells like a cooked pie crust, 10 to 12 minutes.
2. Whisk in about 2 cups of cold stock, a little at a time, stirring to remove any lumps. Add remaining 2 cups stock. Cook, stirring occasionally, until gravy is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, 10 to 15 minutes.
3. Stir in heavy cream, and season with salt, white pepper, and cayenne.
4. Taste and if the gravy still tastes starchy, let it simmer a little longer, adding more cold stock if necessary.
