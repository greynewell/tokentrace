## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 cup whole wheat flour
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 1 ½ teaspoons ground ginger
- 1 ½ teaspoons baking soda
- ½ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ½ teaspoon ground allspice

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray 18 muffin cups with cooking spray or line with paper liners.
2. Whisk all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, cinnamon, ginger, baking soda, nutmeg, allspice, and salt together in a bowl; form a well in the center.
