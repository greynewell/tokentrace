## Ingredients

- 1 ¼ cups warm water - 110 to 115 degrees F (43 to 45 degrees C)
- 3 tablespoons honey
- 2 ¼ teaspoons active dry yeast
- 2 ½ cups bread flour
- ⅓ cup whole wheat bread flour
- ¾ cup amaranth flour
- 1 tablespoon vital wheat gluten flour
- 3 tablespoons grated orange zest

## Instructions

1. Stir water, honey, and yeast together in a large bowl.

4. Stir orange zest, vegetable oil, and salt into yeast mixture.
