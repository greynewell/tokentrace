## Ingredients

- 7 large English cucumbers
- 4 large sweet onions, peeled
- ¼ cup pickling salt
- 3 cups white sugar
- ½ cup all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon ground turmeric
- 1 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1 teaspoon celery seed
- 3 cups distilled white vinegar
- 1 cup water
- 4  (1 pint) canning jars with lids and rings

## Instructions

1. Use the large holes of a box grater to grate cucumbers and onions into a large bowl. Sprinkle pickling salt over the top. Cover tightly; allow to rest at room temperature overnight.
2. Squeeze out as much liquid as possible from cucumber mixture; set aside.
3. Whisk together sugar, flour, turmeric, ginger, and celery seed in a bowl. Heat vinegar and water in a large, heavy pot over medium-high heat. Whisk in sugar mixture until smooth. Stir in cucumber mixture. Bring to a boil and cook, stirring frequently, until thickened, about 15 minutes.
4. Sterilize the jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack relish into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with the lids; screw on the rings.
5. Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then carefully lower the jars into the pot using a holder. Leave a 2-inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary until water level is at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring water to a full boil, cover the pot, and process the jars for 10 minutes.
6. Remove the jars from the stockpot and place them onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (the lid does not move up or down at all). Store in a cool, dark area.
