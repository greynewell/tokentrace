## Ingredients

- 1 cup canned crushed tomatoes (such as San Marzano)
- ¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste
- 2 cups water
- 1 (8 ounce) fillet sea bass
- 8  uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 8 ounces calamari rings and tentacles
- 12  mussels, cleaned and debearded
- 12  clams in shell, scrubbed
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- ½ bulb fennel - cored, thinly sliced, and fronds reserved
- 4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
- salt to taste
- ½ cup white wine
- ¼ cup freshly chopped parsley

## Instructions

1. Combine tomatoes, red pepper flakes, and water in a measuring cup or bowl. Puree using an immersion blender until smooth.
2. Cut sea bass into roughly 1 1/2-inch chunks to match the other seafood in size. Place sea bass, shrimp, calamari, mussels, and clams in individual dishes so they're ready to use.
3. Melt butter and olive oil in a deep pan over medium-high heat. Add sliced fennel, garlic, and salt; cook and stir until garlic takes on color, about 1 minute. Stir in white wine. Let simmer until reduced by about half, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in tomato broth base; bring to a boil and cook until fennel is tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Taste and adjust seasonings.
4. Stir in parsley, sea bass, shrimp, and calamari. Add clams and mussels. Cover, increase heat to high, and cook until clam and mussel shells open and sea bass, shrimp, and calamari are opaque, about 5 minutes.
5. Transfer to warm serving bowls. Garnish with reserved fennel fronds and serve.
