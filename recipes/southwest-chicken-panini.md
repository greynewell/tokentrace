## Ingredients

- ¼ cup water
- ¼ cup vegetable oil
- 1 (1.06 ounce) package mesquite marinade
- 2 (4 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- 1 teaspoon olive oil
- ½ medium red bell pepper, sliced
- ½ medium green bell pepper, sliced
- ½ medium onion, sliced
- 2 teaspoons salted butter, softened
- 4 slices sourdough bread
- ¾ cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese

## Instructions

1. Whisk water, vegetable oil, and marinade mix together in a glass or ceramic bowl. Add chicken and toss to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for 15 to 30 minutes, or overnight.
2. Preheat an electric grill (such as George Foreman®) for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
3. Remove chicken from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade.
4. Place chicken on the preheated grill, close the lid, and cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 6 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
5. While chicken is cooking, heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add bell peppers and onion and saute until tender, 5 to 7 minutes.
6. Butter one side of each slice of bread. Assemble 2 sandwiches by layering Monterey Jack cheese, vegetables, and chicken between the unbuttered sides of the bread.
7. Place sandwiches on the grill, close the lid, and cook until bread is golden brown and cheese is melted, about 3 minutes.
