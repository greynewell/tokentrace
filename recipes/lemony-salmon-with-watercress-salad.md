## Instructions

1. Whisk honey, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, shallot, 1 1/2 teaspoon olive oil, and 1/4 teaspoon lemon zest together in a shallow baking dish. Add salmon fillets and turn to coat. Cover and refrigerate until flavors combine, 15 minutes to 1 hour.

5. Transfer salmon fillets, with marinade, to the prepared baking sheet.
