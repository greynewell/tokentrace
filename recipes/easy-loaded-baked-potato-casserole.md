## Ingredients

- 10  Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and halved
- 6 slices bacon
- 1 ½ cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
- 1 cup evaporated milk
- ½ cup sour cream
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 cup sliced green onions, divided

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
2. Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and return potatoes to pot.
3. Meanwhile, arrange bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon on paper towels and crumble.
4. Combine 1 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese, evaporated milk, sour cream, salt, and black pepper in the pot with potatoes. Mash with a potato masher until creamy. Spread potato mixture into prepared baking dish.
