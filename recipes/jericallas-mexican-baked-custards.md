## Ingredients

- 1 quart whole milk
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 (3 inch) pieces cinnamon sticks
- 5 large eggs, beaten

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Combine milk, sugar, vanilla extract, and cinnamon sticks in a small saucepan over medium heat. Simmer for 3 minutes, then turn off and allow to cool until lukewarm.
3. Add 3 tablespoons of the milk mixture to the beaten eggs and stir to combine.
4. Remove cinnamon sticks from the milk and discard. Gradually beat eggs into the lukewarm milk mixture until combined. Pour mixture into ramekins and place them in a large roasting tin. Add enough water so it reaches halfway up the sides of the ramekins.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until tops are lightly browned, about 40 minutes. Check the water level every so often so it does not cook dry, adding more water if needed.
