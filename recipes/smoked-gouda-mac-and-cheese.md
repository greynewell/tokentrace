## Ingredients

- 1 (16 ounce) package seashell pasta
- 2 ½ tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 2 ½ cups milk
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground white pepper
- 4 ounces smoked Gouda cheese, shredded

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a 10-inch casserole dish.
2. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add shells and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 9 minutes.
3. While the pasta is cooking, melt butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk in flour and stir until the mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown, 2 to 4 minutes. Gradually whisk milk, salt, and pepper into the flour mixture, and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook, whisking constantly, until the sauce is thick and smooth and coats the back of a spoon, 5 to 10 minutes.
4. Drain pasta and transfer to a large bowl. Pour cheese sauce over top, and mix until thoroughly combined. Transfer mixture to the prepared casserole dish.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until heated through, about 15 minutes.
