## Ingredients

- 3 cups water, or as needed
- 1 ½ cups walnuts
- 2 cloves garlic, peeled
- 1 pinch sea salt
- 1 teaspoon chopped fresh marjoram
- 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme
- 1 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano
- ½ cup extra-virgin olive oil
- ¾ cup heavy cream
- 1 cup finely grated Pecorino Romano cheese
- freshly ground black pepper to taste
- sea salt to taste
- 1 (16 ounce) box dry fettuccine pasta
- ½ bunch fresh chives, finely chopped

## Instructions

1. Bring water to a boil in a small saucepan. Add walnuts and cook until they have softened slightly, about 5 minutes. Drain and set aside.
2. Combine garlic and pinch sea salt in the bowl of a mortar and pestle. Grind to create a thick paste. Add walnuts, marjoram, thyme, and oregano. Grind until combined and slightly creamy, but still coarse.
3. Transfer the walnut mixture to a large bowl. Slowly whisk in olive oil to form a thick emulsion. Add heavy cream and Pecorino Romano cheese and whisk until combined. Season with black pepper and sea salt to taste.
4. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in fettuccine, return to a boil, and cook pasta over medium heat until cooked through but still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.
5. Toss walnut sauce with pasta. Garnish with fresh chives.
