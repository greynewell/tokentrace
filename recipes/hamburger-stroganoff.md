## Ingredients

- 1 pound ground beef chuck
- 1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
- 1  onion, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 (14 ounce) can beef broth
- 1 (10.75 ounce) can  condensed cream of mushroom soup

## Instructions

1. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Add beef, mushrooms, onion, and garlic. Saute until beef is browned and crumbly, 6 to 8 minutes. Add flour; cook and stir until combined, about 2 minutes.
