## Ingredients

- 2 (3 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
- ½ cup peanut butter
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 1  egg
- 2 tablespoons milk
- 1 cup butter or margarine, melted
- 2 cups white sugar
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 3  eggs
- ¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
2. Make peanut butter batter: Beat cream cheese, peanut butter, sugar, egg, and milk in a medium bowl until smooth. Set aside.
3. Make brownie batter: Mix together sugar, melted butter, and vanilla in a large bowl until combined. Mix in eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Combine flour, cocoa, baking powder, and salt in a separate bowl; mix into batter until well combined. Stir in chocolate chips until incorporated.
4. Set aside 1 cup brownie batter. Spread remaining brownie batter into the prepared dish. Spread peanut butter batter on top. Drop reserved chocolate batter by teaspoonfuls over the top. Using a knife, gently swirl through the top layers for a marbled effect.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until a wooden toothpick inserted near the center comes out almost clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Cool completely, then cut into bars.
