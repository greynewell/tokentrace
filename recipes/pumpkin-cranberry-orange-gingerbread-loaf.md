## Ingredients

- 1 large orange
- 1 ½ cups white sugar
- ½ cup unsalted butter, softened
- 2 large eggs
- 1 (14 ounce) can pumpkin puree
- ¼ cup orange juice
- 2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons ground ginger
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup sweetened dried cranberries (such as Craisins®)
- ⅔ cup chopped pecans

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan and lightly dust the bottom with flour.
2. Zest the entire orange, avoiding the white (pith). Peel and section the orange and remove all seeds. Chop orange pulp in the bowl of a food processor or blender until fine. Reserve with the zest.
3. Cream sugar and butter together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until very well combined. Beat in eggs, one at a time, until thoroughly incorporated. Stir in pumpkin, reserved chopped orange and zest, orange juice, and grated ginger.
4. Whisk flour, ginger, baking soda, cinnamon, baking powder, and salt together in a separate bowl. Stir into the wet batter until almost all is moistened, but do not overwork. Fold in dried cranberries and pecans. Turn into the prepared loaf pan.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Let cool in the pan, on a wire rack, for 15 minutes. Remove from the pan and let cool completely on the wire rack before wrapping.
