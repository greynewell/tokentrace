## Ingredients

- 2 large baking potatoes, scrubbed and patted dry
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided, or to taste
- ½ teaspoon salt-free seasoning blend (such as Mrs. Dash®), or to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
2. Cut a small slice off the bottom of each potato to prevent them from rolling back and forth on the cutting board. Slice potatoes into 1/4-inch slices on the widest side.
3. Lay slices flat on a large cookie sheet. Lightly brush one side with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Sprinkle with seasoning.
4. Place potatoes on the hot grill, seasoned side-down. Brush with remaining tablespoon oil and sprinkle seasoning over the second side. Close lid and cook for 15 to 20 minutes, turning once halfway through.
