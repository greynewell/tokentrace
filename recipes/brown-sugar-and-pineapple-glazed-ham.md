## Ingredients

- 1 (6 pound) fully-cooked, bone-in ham
- 1  fresh pineapple
- 2 (6 ounce) cans pineapple juice
- 1 cup brown sugar

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Place ham, cut-side down, into a roasting pan.
2. Cut skin off pineapple with a sharp knife and slice off any brown spots or skin left behind. Cut pineapple into 1/2-inch-thick rings and use a round cutter to remove cores. Pin rings onto ham with toothpicks.
3. Bake ham in the preheated oven for 30 minutes.
4. While ham bakes, mix pineapple juice and brown sugar in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on medium power until glaze is boiling and slightly thickened. Work carefully because glaze will be sticky and very hot.
5. Pour 1/2 of the glaze evenly over ham and pineapple rings. Bake ham for 30 minutes more, then pour remaining glaze over ham.
6. Continue baking ham until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of ham reads 140 degrees F (60 degrees C), 30 to 60 minutes more.
