## Ingredients

- ¼ cup pine nuts
- 1 cup quinoa
- 2 cups water
- sea salt to taste
- ¼ cup fresh lemon juice
- 2 stalks celery, chopped
- ¼  red onion, chopped
- ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- ½ teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 bunch fresh parsley, chopped

## Instructions

1. Toast the pine nuts briefly in a dry skillet over medium heat. This will take about 5 minutes, and stir constantly as they will burn easily. Set aside to cool.
2. In a saucepan, combine the quinoa, water and salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium and cook until quinoa is tender and water has been absorbed, about 10 minutes. Cool slightly, then fluff with a fork.
3. Transfer the quinoa to a serving bowl and stir in the pine nuts, lemon juice, celery, onion, cayenne pepper, cumin and parsley. Adjust salt and pepper if needed before serving.
