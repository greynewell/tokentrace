## Ingredients

- 4 (6 ounce) thick cut pork chops
- 8 slices smoked Gouda cheese
- ½ pound fresh spinach, rinsed and torn into bite-size pieces
- 3 tablespoons horseradish mustard
- 1 cup panko crumbs  or breadcrumbs
- Creole-style seasoning to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Coat a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
2. Lay each pork chop flat on a cutting board. Use a sharp knife held parallel to the board to cut a deep pocket into each chop, leaving three sides intact. Fill each pocket with spinach, then cheese.
3. Place panko crumbs in a shallow dish. Spread a thin layer of horseradish over each chop, then roll in crumbs to coat. Arrange chops in the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle with Creole seasoning.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until brown and crispy, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into pork should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
