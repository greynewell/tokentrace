## Ingredients

- 1  skinless, boneless chicken breast half - lightly pounded to an even thickness
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 tablespoon berbere spice blend, or to taste
- 2 teaspoons butter
- 1  lime, juiced
- 2 teaspoons tomato paste
- ¼ cup chicken broth, or as needed
- ⅓ cup coconut milk
- ½ teaspoon berbere spice blend, or to taste
- Salt to taste
- 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro

## Instructions

1. Season both sides of chicken breast with salt and berbere spice.
2. Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat until it just starts to turn brown. Immediately transfer chicken breast to the skillet; cook 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a warm dish.
3. Add lime juice, tomato paste, chicken broth, and coconut milk to the skillet; stir to deglaze. Bring to a simmer while stirring. Add 1/2 teaspoon berbere spice and a pinch of salt.
4. Return chicken breast to the skillet; reduce heat to medium-low. Cook until chicken is cooked through and sauce starts to reduce, 4 to 5 more minutes, basting chicken with pan juices as it cooks. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
5. Sprinkle with chopped cilantro. Serve with a drizzle of pan sauce.
