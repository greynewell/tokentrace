## Ingredients

- ½ cup brewed espresso
- 3 tablespoons Marsala wine, divided
- 2  eggs, separated
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- ¾ cup mascarpone cheese
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 pinch salt
- 10  ladyfinger cookies, broken in half, or more as needed
- 1 tablespoon cocoa powder
- ½ ounce dark chocolate, grated

## Instructions

1. Stir together espresso and 2 tablespoons wine in a shallow bowl. Set aside.
2. Whisk together egg yolks, 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon sugar, and remaining 1 tablespoon wine in a large bowl over a pot of simmering water until thick, pale yellow, and creamy, 5 to 6 minutes.
3. Remove the bowl from heat and whisk in mascarpone, vanilla, and salt until completely smooth.
4. Beat egg whites in a glass or metal bowl until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up to ensure egg whites form sharp peaks. Gently stir and fold 1/2 of the egg whites into mascarpone mixture; fold in remaining egg whites.
5. Place 1 heaping spoonful mascarpone mixture into a single-serving glass or cup. Dip 2 cookie halves briefly in espresso mixture; turn 3 to 4 times to coat. Place cookie halves in the bottom of the glass on top of mascarpone.
6. Fill the glass halfway with mascarpone mixture. Dip 5 ladyfinger halves in espresso mixture and place vertically along the inside of the glass, dipping and placing more ladyfinger halves as needed to fit the glass. Place 2 dipped ladyfinger halves horizontally on top of mascarpone. Fill the glass to the top with mascarpone mixture. Repeat with second glass.
7. Wrap both glasses in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 8 hours to overnight. Remove plastic wrap and dust tops with cocoa and grated chocolate before serving.
