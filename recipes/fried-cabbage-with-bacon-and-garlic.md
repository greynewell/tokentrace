## Ingredients

- 1 (1 pound) package bacon, finely chopped
- 1 teaspoon olive oil
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 pounds diced cabbage
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes

## Instructions

1. Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until browned and crispy, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels and remove most of the bacon grease from the skillet.
2. Add oil to the skillet and heat over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add cabbage, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes; cook and stir until cabbage is tender, 10 to 15 minutes. If you prefer softer cabbage, cover the skillet while cooking to give it some steam.
3. Crumble bacon into the skillet and mix with the cabbage until well combined.
