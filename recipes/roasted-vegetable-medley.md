## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- 1 large yam, peeled and cut into 1 inch pieces
- 1 large parsnip, peeled and cut into 1 inch pieces
- 1 cup baby carrots

- 1 bunch fresh asparagus, trimmed and cut into 1 inch pieces
- ½ cup roasted red peppers, cut into 1-inch pieces
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
