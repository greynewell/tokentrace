## Ingredients

- ½ pound bacon
- 1  double crust ready-to-use pie crust
- 1 small onion, chopped
- 3 stalks celery, chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 small green bell pepper, chopped
- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- ¾ cup heavy cream
- 24  oysters, shucked with liquid reserved
- ½ teaspoon seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®), or more to taste

## Instructions

1. Cook the bacon in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat until golden brown, about 10 minutes; remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain, reserving the drippings.
2. Crumble the bacon.
3. Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
4. Line a 9-inch pie pan with 1 of the pie crusts.
5. Heat 1 tablespoon of the reserved bacon drippings in a skillet over medium-low heat; add the onion, celery, garlic, and green pepper to the hot drippings, cover, and cook until tender, about 5 minutes.
6. Remove the cooked vegetables to a bowl.
7. Increase heat to medium and stir 3 tablespoons of the reserved drippings and the flour together in the skillet to make a thick paste.
8. Slowly pour the cream and 1 cup of the reserved liquid from the oysters into the paste; cook and stir until a thick gravy forms.
9. Fold the bacon, oysters, and vegetables into the mixture; season with seafood seasoning.
10. Pour the mixture into the prepared pie crust.
11. Cover with the remaining crust.
12. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 30 minutes.
