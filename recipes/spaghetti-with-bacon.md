## Ingredients

- 1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti
- ¼ cup olive oil
- 8 slices bacon, cut into 1/4 inch pieces
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- ½ cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley

## Instructions

1. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the spaghetti, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.
2. Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in the bacon, and cook until the bacon has begun to shrink, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic, and continue cooking and stirring until the garlic has softened, and the bacon is crisp, about 5 minutes. Toss the drained pasta with the bacon, oil, and parsley to serve.
