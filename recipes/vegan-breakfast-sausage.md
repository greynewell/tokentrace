## Ingredients

- 1 cup texturized vegetable protein (TVP)
- 1 cup warm vegetable broth
- 1 tablespoon flaxseed meal
- ¾ cup quick-cooking oats
- 2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon vital wheat gluten
- 2 teaspoons dried sage
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon fennel seeds
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon ground thyme
- ½ teaspoon smoked paprika
- ½ teaspoon salt, or to taste
- ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- ¼ cup water
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon maple syrup
- 1 tablespoon cooking oil

## Instructions

1. Mix TVP, vegetable broth, and flaxseed meal together in a large mixing bowl and let sit for 5 minutes. Add oats, yeast, flour, gluten, sage, black pepper, fennel seeds, garlic powder, thyme, smoked paprika, salt, and cayenne. Mix until well blended.
2. Combine water, soy sauce, and maple syrup in a separate container and mix well. Add to the TVP mixture and combine into a slightly crumbly dough. Mix well to activate gluten and let dough sit for 5 minutes; dough should stiffen slightly and become less crumbly.
3. Form into tablespoon-size balls and flatten slightly.
4. Heat oil in a cast iron or nonstick frying pan over medium heat. Cook sausage patties in the hot oil until golden brown, about 5 minutes on each side.
