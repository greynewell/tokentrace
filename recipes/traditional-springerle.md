## Ingredients

- 1 ½ tablespoons crushed anise seeds
- 3 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 4  eggs
- 2 cups sugar
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- ¼ cup confectioners' sugar

## Instructions

1. Spray 4 cookie sheets with cooking spray; sprinkle with anise seeds and set aside until needed.
2. Mix flour and baking powder together in a large bowl until well blended. Place sugar, eggs, and vanilla in a separate large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until light and frothy, 5 to 8 minutes. Gradually stir flour mixture into egg mixture to form a thick dough.
3. Working with handfuls of dough at a time, roll out onto a lightly floured surface until 1/4 inch thick. Lightly sift confectioners' sugar over dough. Place springerle molds onto dough; press down hard and evenly until the mold's design registers in dough. Remove the mold. Use a small knife to cut around each cookie, and place them 2 inches apart on the prepared cookie sheets. Repeat, until all dough has been used. Cover cookies with a lightweight cotton cloth, and allow to dry for 8 hours, or overnight. The designs will remain embossed in the cookies.
4. When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).
5. Bake cookies in preheated oven until tops are pale brown and cookies are set, 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Store in an airtight container.
