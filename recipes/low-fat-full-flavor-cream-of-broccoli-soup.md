## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon butter
- 4  leeks, chopped
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon fresh ground black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon ground coriander
- 2 heads fresh broccoli, chopped
- 1 (32 ounce) carton low-sodium chicken broth

## Instructions

1. Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add leeks and cook until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in pepper, salt, and coriander.
