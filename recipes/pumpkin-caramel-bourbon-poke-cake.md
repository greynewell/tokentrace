## Ingredients

- 1 cup pumpkin puree
- ¾ cup white sugar
- ½ cup canola oil
- 2 large eggs
- 2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ½ cup caramel sauce
- 1 tablespoon bourbon, divided
- 1 cup heavy whipping cream
- ½ cup chopped toasted pecans

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line an 8-inch square cake pan with parchment paper.
2. Beat pumpkin puree, sugar, oil, eggs, pumpkin pie spice, and vanilla extract together in a bowl.
3. Sift flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt into a bowl. Add to the pumpkin mixture; stir until just combined. Pour into prepared pan; smooth top with a spatula.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes.
5. Combine caramel sauce and 1 1/2 teaspoons bourbon in a saucepan over low heat; warm through, about 2 minutes. Poke holes evenly over the surface of the cake using a chopstick. Reserve 1 teaspoon of the caramel-bourbon mixture; pour remaining mixture over the cake. Place on cooling rack.
6. Beat cream and remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons bourbon in a bowl using an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Spoon whipped cream on cake; scatter pecans and drizzle reserved caramel sauce on top.
