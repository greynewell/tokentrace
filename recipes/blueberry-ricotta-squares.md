## Ingredients

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- ¾ cup white sugar
- 1 ¼ teaspoons baking powder

- ¼ cup shortening
- 1  egg
- ½ teaspoon lemon extract
- 1 ½ cups blueberries

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9 inch square baking dish.
2. In a large bowl, stir together the flour, 3/4 cup of sugar, and baking powder.
