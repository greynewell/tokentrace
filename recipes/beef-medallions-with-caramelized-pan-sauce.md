## Ingredients

- 2 pounds beef tenderloin, trimmed, cut into 8 (4-ounce) medallions
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 8  sliced fresh mushrooms
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 pinch salt
- ½ cup tomato sauce
- ⅓ cup Marsala wine
- 1 cup chicken broth
- 2 teaspoons chopped fresh oregano
- 1 ½ tablespoons chilled unsalted butter, cut into cubes

## Instructions

1. Season beef medallions with salt and pepper to taste and set aside.
2. Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over high heat. Cook beef until browned, about 2 minutes per side. Remove beef to a warm plate.
3. Reduce heat to medium; cook and stir mushrooms, 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, olive oil, and a pinch of salt in the skillet until mushrooms are very well browned, about 10 minutes.
4. Mix in tomato sauce; cook and stir until tomato sauce thickens, about 5 minutes.
5. Pour in Marsala wine and increase heat to high. Cook, scraping browned bits from bottom of skillet. Once most of the wine has evaporated, stir in broth and bring to a boil; cook and stir until broth mixture has reduced by half, about 5 minutes.
6. Reduce heat to low and return beef to broth mixture; simmer until beef is cooked to medium-rare, about 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer beef to serving plates.
7. Remove skillet from heat. Cook and stir 1 1/2 tablespoons butter and oregano into the sauce until butter melts. Taste for seasoning and adjust if necessary.
8. Spoon sauce over beef and serve immediately.
