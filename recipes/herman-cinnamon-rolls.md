## Ingredients

- 2 cups Herman Sourdough Starter
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 3 teaspoons baking powder
- 2  eggs, beaten
- ½ cup margarine
- 1 cup white sugar
- 3 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 2 tablespoons raisins  (Optional)
- 2 tablespoons chopped walnuts  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. In a large bowl combine Herman Sweet Sourdough Starter, flour, baking soda, salt, baking powder and eggs until well blended.
2. Knead dough in bowl for 5 to 7 minutes, or until mixture is smooth.
3. Let rise in warm place until doubled. Punch down. On a lightly floured surface, press dough into a 10 x 20 inch rectangle. Combine melted margarine, sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Spread mixture over dough. Sprinkle with walnuts or raisins, if desired.
4. Starting on long side, roll up dough, jellyroll fashion. Press ends together to make a seam. Cut in 1-inch slices and place in an ungreased, 11x14 inch cake pan. Allow rolls rise to double their size.
