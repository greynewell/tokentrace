## Ingredients

- 1 cup Frozen desserts, ice cream, vanilla
- 2  large egg yolks
- 2 tablespoons Sugars, granulated

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 325°F. In a microwave-safe bowl, heat the ice cream in 20 second intervals, stirring between, until melted. Let the ice cream cool for 5 minutes. Whisk in egg yolks one at a time until the mixture is smooth and consistent. Pour evenly into 2 oven-safe ramekins.
2. Move the ramekins to a baking dish with a high rim. Pour boiling water into the baking dish until half-way up each ramekin. Bake for 40-50 minutes or until set but still jiggly in the center. Allow to cool completely, then wrap with plastic wrap and transfer to the fridge for 2 hours or up to 3 days.
3. When ready to serve, let the ramekins come to room temperature for 30 minutes, then sprinkle 1 tablespoon of sugar over each creme brulee. If you have a kitchen blow torch, torch the sugar until golden and bubbly. If you don't, broil on the top rack of the oven at 500°F for 2-3 minutes, watching to make sure they don't burn. Serve immediately.
