## Ingredients

- 2 cups water
- ¼ cup diced onion
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 ½ teaspoons curry powder
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- ¾ cup white rice
- 2  frozen white fish fillets, unthawed

## Instructions

1. Heat water, onion, butter, curry powder, and salt in a large skillet over medium heat until butter is melted, about 2 minutes. Stir rice into onion mixture and arrange frozen white fish over rice. Sprinkle with almonds.
