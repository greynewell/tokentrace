## Ingredients

- 1 (18.25 ounce) box devil's food chocolate cake mix
- 1 ½ teaspoons ground ancho chile pepper
- ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1 ¼ cups water
- ⅓ cup vegetable oil
- 3  eggs
- 1 teaspoon ground ancho chile pepper
- ⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 4 cups confectioners' sugar, or more as needed
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- ½ cup butter, softened
- ½ teaspoon clear vanilla extract, or to taste
- 24  small dried red chiles

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 24 muffin cups with paper liners.
2. Whisk cake mix, 1 1/2 teaspoons ground ancho chile, and 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper. Beat in water, vegetable oil, and eggs with an electric mixer on medium speed; beat for 2 minutes. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling them 2/3 full.
