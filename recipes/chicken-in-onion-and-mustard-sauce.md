## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon butter
- 3  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- 1 pinch ground black pepper
- 1 small red onion, sliced
- 1 tablespoon dried parsley
- ½ cup applesauce
- ¼ cup white wine
- 2 tablespoons mustard
- ¼ cup half-and-half cream
- ½ cup chopped walnuts

## Instructions

1. Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Season the chicken on both sides with pepper; cook the chicken breasts in the butter until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 6 to 7 minutes each side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove the breasts from the pan and set aside.
2. Stir together the onion, parsley, applesauce, wine, mustard, and half-and-half in the pan; bring the mixture to a boil and cook about 5 minutes. Return the chicken to the pan; add the walnuts. Allow to cook until the chicken is warm, 3 to 5 minutes.
