## Ingredients

- 1 (16 ounce) package kielbasa sausage
- 1 (16 ounce) jar salsa
- 1 (10 ounce) jar grape jelly
- 1 cup water
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 2  eggs
- 1 small onion, chopped
- 2 pounds ground beef
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ cup cornflakes cereal, crushed

## Instructions

1. Fill a large pot with lightly-salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Stir in the kielbasa and return to a boil. Cook until hot, 8 to 10 minutes; drain and cut into bite sized pieces. Place the kielbasa into a slow cooker; stir in the salsa, grape jelly, water, and lemon juice.
2. Meanwhile, beat the eggs in a mixing bowl; mix in the onion, ground beef, salt, pepper, and crushed cornflakes. Mix with your hands until evenly incorporated. Roll the mixture into balls the size of a large walnut; place into the slow cooker.
3. Set the slow cooker on High and cook until the meatballs are no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour.
