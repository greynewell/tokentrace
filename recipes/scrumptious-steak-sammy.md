## Ingredients

- 2 (6 ounce) New York strip steaks
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 6 large button mushrooms, sliced
- 1  bell pepper, cut into matchstick-size pieces
- 2  sandwich buns, split
- ½ cup shredded mozzarella cheese
- ¼ cup mayonnaise

## Instructions

1. Season steaks with salt and pepper; allow steaks to come to room temperature, about 15 minutes.
2. Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat until very hot; lay steaks in pan and cook until they are beginning to firm and are hot and slightly pink in the center, about 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Transfer steaks to a warm plate; cover and let rest, about 10 minutes.
3. Melt butter in same pan over medium heat; stir in mushrooms and peppers. Season with salt and pepper; cook and stir until tender, about 5 minutes.
4. Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
5. Toast buns under the broiler until golden, about 2 minutes. Divide mozzarella cheese over bottom halves of buns; return to broiler until cheese melts, about 2 minutes.
6. Slice steak very thinly. Pile steak slices over cheese-topped bun halves; top with mushrooms and peppers. Spread mayonnaise on top halves of buns; place over sandwich.
