## Ingredients

- 1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 2  very ripe bananas
- ½ cup sour cream
- 1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract
- ¾ cup white sugar
- ½ cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 1 large egg
- 1 large egg yolk
- 1 ½ cups powdered sugar
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, at room temperature
- ½ cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
- ½ cup smooth peanut butter

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 12-cup muffin pan with paper liners.
2. Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a medium bowl. Mash bananas with a fork in another medium bowl until smooth. Mix sour cream and vanilla extract into bananas.
3. Combine sugar and butter in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add egg and egg yolk and beat until well blended. Add flour mixture in 2 batches, alternating with banana mixture, beating batter briefly after each addition until just blended. Scoop batter into the prepared muffin cups, adding about a generous 1/4 cup in each.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool in the tin for 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely, about 20 minutes.
5. Meanwhile, sift powdered sugar into a large bowl. Add cream cheese, butter, and peanut butter; beat with an electric mixer until smooth. Spread or pipe frosting onto the cooled cupcakes.
