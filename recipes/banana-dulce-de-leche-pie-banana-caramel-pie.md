## Ingredients

- 1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
- 1 cup graham cracker crumbs
- ½ cup butter, melted
- 4  bananas
- 1 ½ cups whipping cream
- 2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Make the dulce de leche: Place the unopened condensed milk can in a saucepan and add water until it comes halfway up the can. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and cook for 3 hours, adding more water as necessary. Remove from the heat and let cool, 1 to 2 hours.
2. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
3. Make the pie: Stir graham cracker crumbs and melted butter in a mixing bowl until well blended. Press crumb mixture evenly into a 9-inch pie plate.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove pie crust from the oven and cool on a wire rack, about 10 minutes.
5. Open dulce de leche can and pour 1/2 of it (about 3/4 cup) over pie crust. Arrange 1/2 of the bananas in a single layer over dulce de leche. Repeat dulce de leche and banana layers once more.
6. Beat cream in a mixing bowl with an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Add sugar and vanilla; continue beating until stiff peaks form.
7. Spoon whipped cream over bananas. Chill pie for at least 1 hour before serving.
