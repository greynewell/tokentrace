## Ingredients

- ¾ cup graham cracker crumbs
- 3 tablespoons butter, melted
- ¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- 1 ½ cups milk
- 1 (1 ounce) package cheesecake flavor sugar-free instant pudding mix
- 2 pints fresh strawberries, sliced

## Instructions

1. Combine graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a bowl. Press the mixture into an 8-inch pie dish; refrigerate while making the filling.
2. Beat cream cheese in a mixing bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until softened. Reduce speed to low; gradually beat in milk (the mixture will be watery). Use a rubber spatula to scrape cream cheese from the sides of the bowl, if necessary. Beat in pudding mix until the filling is thick and smooth.
3. Spoon 1/2 of the cream cheese filling onto the bottom of prepared crust. Spread 1/2 of the strawberries over the filling; repeat with remaining filling and strawberries.
4. Chill pie in refrigerator until filling is set, at least 1 hour.
