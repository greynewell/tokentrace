## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 pounds beef shank
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1  onion, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
- 2 stalks celery, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
- 1 cup Marsala wine
- 1 (14 ounce) can beef broth
- water to cover
- 2 tablespoons dried tarragon

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
2. Heat olive oil in an oven-proof deep skillet with a lid over medium-high heat.
3. Season beef shank with salt and pepper. Cook beef shank in hot oil until browned on all sides, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer beef shank to a plate.
4. Sauté onion and celery in the same skillet until onion turns translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Pour in wine and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon.
5. Place beef shank into onion-wine mixture; add beef broth and pour in enough water to cover 1/2 to 3/4 of the beef shank. Sprinkle tarragon over shank; cover the skillet with a lid.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until meat falls off the bone, about 5 hours. Season with salt and pepper before serving.
