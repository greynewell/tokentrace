## Ingredients

- ¾ cup raisins
- 2 cups gluten-free bread flour mix
- ½ cup buckwheat flour
- ¼ cup coconut sugar
- 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
- 1 pinch cream of tartar
- 1 pinch baking soda
- ¾ cup whole milk, at room temperature
- ½ cup gluten-free sourdough starter
- 1 teaspoon agave nectar
- 3  eggs, lightly beaten
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Place raisins into a bowl and cover with lukewarm water. Set aside to soak.
2. Line a loaf pan with parchment paper. Whisk gluten-free bread flour, buckwheat flour, coconut sugar, cinnamon, cream of tartar, and baking soda together in a bowl.
3. Combine milk, sourdough starter, and agave in the bowl of a stand mixer. Start mixer on low and add flour mixture 1 tablespoon at a time until well combined. Add eggs and vanilla extract and mix until well incorporated. Drain raisins and fold into the batter.
4. Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan. Smooth out the top using a wet rubber scraper. Loosely cover the pan with plastic wrap and let rise until almost doubled in size, about 2 hours. Cover with foil.
5. Heat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake bread for 30 minutes. Remove foil and continue baking until bread is browned and has reached an internal temperature of 200 degrees F (95 degrees C), about 10 minutes more.
6. Cool in the pan for 5 minutes. Turn bread out from pan onto a wire rack and allow to cool completely before slicing.
