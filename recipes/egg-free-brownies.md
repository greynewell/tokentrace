## Ingredients

- ⅓ cup all-purpose flour
- 1 cup water
- ½ cup butter
- ⅔ cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 2 cups white sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 ½ teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ cup chopped walnuts  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch pan. In a heavy saucepan combine the 1/3 cup of flour and water. Cook over medium heat stirring constantly until thick. Transfer to a mixing bowl and set aside to cool.
