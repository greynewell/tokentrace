## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 large onions, chopped
- 2 teaspoons salt, divided
- 2 sprigs fresh thyme
- 8 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 2  Turkish bay leaves
- 6 cups vegetable broth
- 1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
- 2 cups red lentils, picked over and rinsed
- 1 ½ tablespoons tomato paste
- 2 tablespoons dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 2 cups water
- 4 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley
- 1  lemon, sliced into wedges

## Instructions

1. Heat olive oil in a heavy saucepan over medium heat. Add onions and 1 teaspoon salt; cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 8 minutes. Add thyme sprigs, garlic, cumin, and bay leaves; cook, stirring, for 1 minute more.
2. Add vegetable broth, tomatoes, red lentils, tomato paste, oregano, remaining salt, and pepper to the saucepan. Cover partially and simmer, stirring occasionally, until lentils are very soft and falling apart, 30 to 45 minutes.
