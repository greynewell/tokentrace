## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
- 1 cup red wine, divided
- 1 pound ground beef
- 1 cup diced yellow onion
- 1 cup diced tomatoes
- ½ cup chopped red bell pepper
- ½ cup chopped green bell pepper
- ¼ cup minced garlic
- 2 tablespoons oregano
- 2 tablespoons basil
- 1 tablespoon rosemary
- 1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
- 1 (28 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce

## Instructions

1. Melt butter with olive oil in a small skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir mushrooms in butter and oil until softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in 1/4 cup red wine and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until mushrooms are very dark and shrunken in size, about 20 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, heat a large pot over medium heat. Add ground beef, yellow onion, diced tomatoes, red bell pepper, green bell pepper, and garlic to the pot; cook and stir until beef is completely browned, about 10 minutes. Season with oregano, basil, and rosemary.
3. Stir 3/4 cup red wine and tomato paste into beef mixture. Pour spaghetti sauce into the pot; stir. Bring to a simmer and continue cooking until flavors blend, 10 to 30 minutes. Serve over your favorite pasta and top with mushrooms.
