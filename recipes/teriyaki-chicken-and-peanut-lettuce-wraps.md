## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon dried minced onion
- 1 teaspoon ground allspice
- 1 teaspoon chili powder
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 3 (5 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- 1 cup roasted peanuts
- 2 cups sugar snap peas
- 1 large red bell pepper, julienned
- 1 large carrot, julienned
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
- ⅔ cup teriyaki sauce, or to taste
- 1 head iceberg lettuce, leaves separated

## Instructions

1. Combine minced onion, allspice, chili powder, pepper, and salt in a small bowl.
2. Clean chicken breasts and trim and discard any fat.
3. Cut chicken into strips, then dice into small pieces.
4. Sprinkle with spice mixture and set aside.
5. Place roasted peanuts between 2 paper towels and crush with a hammer until finely chopped; you are looking for a crumb topping consistency.
6. Combine snap peas, bell pepper, and carrot in a bowl.
7. Set a burner on your stove to high heat.
8. Add 1 tablespoon oil to your wok and place over the hot burner.
9. When oil is heated, add vegetable mixture.
10. Cook and stir until carrots are tender but snap peas are still crisp, about 3 minutes.
11. Transfer vegetables back to the bowl.
12. Add remaining oil to the wok and allow to reheat.
13. Add spiced chicken; stir-fry until no longer pink, 5 to 8 minutes.
14. Drain chicken and return to the stovetop.
15. Add crushed peanuts and teriyaki sauce.
16. Cook and stir until peanuts and sauce have formed a thick paste on the chicken, about 3 minutes.
17. Pour the vegetables back into the wok and toss until well coated.
18. Remove from the heat.
19. Transfer stir-fry mixture into a bowl.
20. Serve immediately with lettuce leaves for wrapping.
