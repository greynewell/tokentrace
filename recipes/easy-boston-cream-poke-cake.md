## Ingredients

- 1 (15.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix
- 1 cup water
- 3  eggs
- ¼ cup vegetable oil
- 4 cups milk
- 2 (3.5 ounce) packages instant vanilla pudding mix
- 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
- 1 cup heavy whipping cream

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch pan.
2. Make the cake: Beat cake mix, water, eggs, and oil in a large bowl with an electric mixer until combined. Pour batter into the prepared pan.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Let cool for 15 to 30 minutes.
4. Make the pudding: Whisk milk and pudding mix together in a bowl until just starting to thicken. Poke holes all over cake with the handle of a wooden spoon. Pour pudding mixture over cake, and spread over entire surface to fill the holes. Refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour.
5. When the cake is almost firm, make the ganache: Place chocolate chips into a glass bowl.
6. Heat cream in a small saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until bubbles form, about 3 minutes. Pour hot cream over chocolate chips; whisk until smooth.
7. Spread ganache over cake.
