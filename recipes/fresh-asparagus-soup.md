## Ingredients

- 1 pound fresh asparagus
- ¾ cup chopped onion
- ½ cup vegetable broth
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 pinch ground black pepper
- 1 ¼ cups vegetable broth
- 1 cup soy milk
- ½ cup yogurt
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice
- ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese

## Instructions

1. Place asparagus and onion in a saucepan with 1/2 cup vegetable broth. Bring the broth to a boil, reduce heat and let simmer until the vegetables are tender.
