## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 4  eggs, at room temperature
- ¾ cup white sugar
- ¼ cup strawberries and cream liqueur (such as Baileys®)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
- 1 ½ cups strawberries and cream liqueur (such as Baileys®)
- 1 cup heavy whipping cream
- ½ cup confectioners' sugar
- 3 tablespoons strawberry-flavored gelatin mix (such as Jell-O®)
- 1 cup sliced fresh strawberries  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat an 11x7-inch baking pan with cooking spray.
2. Beat eggs in a bowl using an electric mixer until frothy. Add sugar and continue to beat until thick and creamy, 4 to 5 minutes. Add liqueur and vanilla extract; mix to combine. Add flour, baking powder, and salt and mix until just combined; do not overbeat. Pour batter into the prepared baking pan.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 22 to 25 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool, about 1 hour.
4. Combine sweetened condensed milk and liqueur in a bowl and stir until well combined. Poke holes throughout the cooled cake using a skewer or toothpick. Slowly pour sauce over the cake. Cover with aluminum foil and refrigerate until sauce is absorbed, at least 2 hours.
5. Beat cream in a chilled glass or metal bowl using an electric mixer until frothy. Add confectioners' sugar and gelatin mix gradually, continuing to beat topping until stiff peaks form.
6. Serve poke cake with whipped cream topping and sliced strawberries.
