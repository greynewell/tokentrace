## Ingredients

- 1 cup warm water (95 to 110 degrees F/35 to 43 degrees C)
- 1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
- 2 tablespoons shortening
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt
- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
- 3 cups all-purpose flour

## Instructions

1. Combine warm water and yeast in a small bowl; stir until yeast is dissolved. Let stand until yeast forms a creamy foam, about 10 minutes.
2. Pour yeast mixture into a large bowl; add shortening, salt, sugar, and Italian seasoning. Stir in flour by hand until dough comes together.
3. Turn dough out on a floured work surface and knead until smooth, 5 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a large greased bowl. Cover with a moist towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 45 minutes.
4. Punch dough down gently. Let stand for 3 to 5 minutes for air to release. Roll into a ball; spread and stretch over the bottom of a pizza pan. Let rise for 15 minutes before topping and baking.
