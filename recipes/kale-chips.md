## Ingredients

- 1 bunch kale
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, divided
- 1 tablespoon sherry vinegar
- 1 pinch sea salt, to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
2. Cut away inner ribs from each kale leaf and discard; tear leaves into pieces of uniform size, about the size of a small potato chip. Wash torn kale pieces and spin dry in a salad spinner or dry with paper towels until very dry.
3. Place kale pieces into a large resealable bag. Add about 1/2 of the olive oil; squeeze out air and seal, then massage the bag so oil gets distributed evenly on kale pieces. Add remaining oil and massage the bag more, until all kale pieces are evenly coated with oil. Sprinkle vinegar over the kale leaves, reseal the bag and shake well. Spread the leaves evenly onto a baking sheet.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until mostly crisp, about 35 minutes. Season with salt and serve immediately.
