- ½ (6.75 ounce) package dried rice noodles
- 8  rice wrappers (8.5 inch diameter)
- 8  fresh mint leaves
- 8  cooked medium shrimp, sliced in half lengthwise
- 1 ½ cups bean sprouts

6. Place two shrimp halves over the mint leaf, top with a small handful of the noodles, and 5 to 6 bean sprouts.
7. Season to taste with fish sauce, and garnish with cilantro leaves.
