## Ingredients

- 1 (16 ounce) package frozen cut okra
- butter flavored cooking spray
- ¼ cup yellow cornmeal
- ¼ cup panko bread crumbs
- ½ teaspoon garlic salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place a baking rack on top of a baking sheet or sheet pan.
2. Cook the frozen okra in the microwave using your microwave's frozen vegetable setting, or on high for 8 minutes. Drain and cool on paper towels, about 5 to 10 minutes. Spray generously with butter flavored cooking spray. Add the cornmeal, panko bread crumbs, garlic salt, and pepper to a plastic food storage bag. Place the okra into the bag and shake to coat the okra with the cornmeal mixture.
