## Ingredients

- 4 pounds potatoes, peeled
- 15 slices bacon
- 1 (16 ounce) container reduced-fat sour cream
- 2 tablespoons mayonnaise
- 2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
- 2 tablespoons dried chives
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper

## Instructions

1. Place the potatoes into a large pot and cover with lightly salted water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until just tender, about 15 minutes. Drain the potatoes, and allow to cool to room temperature. Dice once cooled.
2. Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate. Allow to cool, and crumble the bacon into a large bowl.
3. Place the cooled potatoes into the bowl with the bacon, and mix in the sour cream, mayonnaise, Cheddar cheese, chives, salt, and pepper. Refrigerate overnight before serving.
