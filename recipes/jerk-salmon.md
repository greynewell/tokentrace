## Ingredients

- 4 (3 ounce) fillets salmon fillets, or more to taste
- ice cold water to cover
- 1 pinch salt
- 4 drops lemon juice
- ¼ teaspoon garlic powder
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons jerk marinade, or more to taste
- 3 bunches scallions, chopped
- ½  yellow onion, thinly sliced
- 5 sprigs cilantro, chopped
- 1 teaspoon chopped ginger
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil

## Instructions

1. Place salmon in a large bowl with ice cold water and 1 pinch salt. Let soak, about 10 minutes. Run a knife along the skin to remove all scales.
2. Rinse salmon in ice cold water and lemon juice. Pat dry with a paper towel.
3. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
4. Combine garlic powder and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a small bowl. Sprinkle lightly over both sides of each salmon fillet. Rub jerk marinade over both sides of salmon.
5. Place salmon fillets in a large bowl. Add scallions, onion, cilantro, and ginger; mix well to combine.
6. Heat oil in an ovensafe skillet over medium heat. Cook salmon fillets skin-side down, in batches if necessary, until skin is golden, about 2 minutes. Flip and continue cooking until flesh is pale pink, 1 to 2 minutes more. Place skillet in the oven.
7. Bake salmon in the preheated oven until flesh flakes easily with a fork, about 2 minutes. Remove skillet from oven and allow salmon to rest before serving, 3 to 5 minutes.
