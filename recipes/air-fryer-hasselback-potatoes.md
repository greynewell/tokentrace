## Ingredients

- 4 medium Yukon Gold potatoes
- 3 tablespoons melted butter
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 3 cloves garlic, crushed
- ½ teaspoon ground paprika
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley

## Instructions

1. Preheat an air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Cut 1/4-inch slices into each potato, making sure the knife only cuts through to the bottom 1/2-inch, keeping the bottom of potato intact.
3. Combine butter, olive oil, garlic, and paprika in a small bowl. Brush some of the mixture over each potato and into the slits. Season with salt and pepper.
4. Place potatoes in the basket and cook in the preheated air fryer for 15 minutes. Brush potatoes with butter mixture, making sure it drips down the fanned-out slices to ensure potatoes will not be dry. Cook until potatoes are cooked through, about 15 minutes more.
5. Remove potatoes from the basket and brush with any remaining butter mixture. Sprinkle with chopped parsley.
