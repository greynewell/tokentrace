## Ingredients

- 2 teaspoons seasoned salt
- 2 teaspoons garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 4  pork chops, 3/4-inch thick, or more to taste
- ½ cup self-rising flour
- ¼ cup vegetable oil
- 1  yellow onion, thinly sliced
- 1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms, or more to taste
- 1 teaspoon water, or as needed  (Optional)
- 2 cups water  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Mix seasoned salt, garlic powder, black pepper, and paprika together in a bowl; rub about 3/4 teaspoon spice mixture onto each pork chop. Thoroughly coat each pork chop with flour, saving remaining seasoning and flour for the gravy.
2. Heat vegetable oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat; cook pork chops in the hot oil until browned, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer pork chops to a plate, retaining drippings in the pan. Cover pork chops with paper towels.
3. Cook and stir onion in the drippings in the heavy skillet over medium heat until browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Add mushrooms, remaining flour, remaining spice mixture, and about 1 teaspoon water if needed to moisten; cook and stir until onion is golden brown, about 5 minutes.
4. Stir 2 cups water into onion-mushroom mixture until gravy is smooth; bring to a boil. Place pork chops in the gravy, reduce heat, cover skillet, and simmer until pork chops are tender, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
