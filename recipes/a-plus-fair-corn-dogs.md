## Ingredients

- 1 quart oil for deep frying
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- ⅔ cup yellow cornmeal
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 1 ½ teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons bacon drippings
- 1  egg, beaten
- 1 ¼ cups buttermilk
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- 2 pounds hot dogs
- wooden sticks

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a deep fryer to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C).
2. In a large bowl, stir together the flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder and salt. Stir in melted bacon drippings. Make a well in the center, and pour in the egg, buttermilk, and baking soda. Mix until everything is smooth and well blended.
3. Pat the hot dogs dry with paper towels so that the batter will stick. Insert wooden sticks into the ends. Dip the hot dogs in the batter one at a time, shaking off the excess. Deep fry a few at a time in the hot oil until they are as brown as you like them. Drain on paper towels or serve on paper plates.
