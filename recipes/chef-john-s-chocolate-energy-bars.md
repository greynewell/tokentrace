## Ingredients

- 2 cups pitted Medjool dates, roughly chopped
- 2 cups raw cashews
- 1 cup raw or roasted unsalted almonds
- ¾ cup high-quality unsweetened cocoa powder (such as Guittard® Cocoa Rouge)
- 2 tablespoons coconut oil, melted
- ½ cup unsweetened shredded coconut
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 tablespoon cold espresso, or more as needed (or water)
- ½ teaspoon kosher salt
- ½ pinch cayenne pepper

## Instructions

1. Place cashews, almonds, coconut, dates, cocoa, coconut oil, vanilla, cold coffee, cayenne and salt in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse on and off to start. Process about 1 minute; check to ensure mixture is sticky and moist enough to stick together. Add more coffee if needed. Continue to process until mixture becomes a chunky mass.
2. Line a baking pan with plastic wrap. Scoop mixture into pan. Press down with a spatula until mixture is even. Place a layer of plastic wrap on the surface and smooth again with your hands.
3. Refrigerate until cold and firm, 2 or 3 hours.
4. Remove from the pan and unwrap. Cut into bars of your preferred size. Store in a zip top back in the refrigerator.
