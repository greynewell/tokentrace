## Ingredients

- 3 cups self-rising flour
- ⅛ teaspoon baking soda
- ⅛ teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- ½ cup shortening
- 1 cup tomato-vegetable juice cocktail

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.
2. Stir the flour, baking soda, salt, and sugar together in a bowl, and cut in the shortening with a pastry cutter until the mixture looks like crumbs. Mix in the vegetable juice cocktail just until moist, and turn out onto a well-floured work surface. Gently knead several times just until dough holds together, roll out to 1/2-inch thick, and cut into rounds with a biscuit cutter. Place the biscuits onto the prepared baking sheet.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until risen and lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes.
