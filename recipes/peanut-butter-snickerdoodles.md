## Ingredients

- 1 ¼ cups peanut butter
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 cup packed brown sugar
- ½ cup unsalted butter
- ½ cup shortening
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2  eggs
- 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons cream of tartar
- 1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 1 ½ teaspoons baking soda
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ cup white sugar, or to taste
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Combine peanut butter, 1 cup white sugar, brown sugar, butter, and shortening in a large bowl. Beat with an electric mixer until creamy. Stir in vanilla extract. Beat in eggs.
3. Sift flour, cream of tartar, 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together in a separate bowl. Gradually add to the egg mixture and mix well.
4. Mix 1/4 cup sugar and 2 teaspoons cinnamon together in a shallow bowl. Roll dough into 1-inch balls, roll in cinnamon-sugar, and place on a baking sheet. Flatten each ball slightly with the bottom of a drinking glass, or by making a criss-cross pattern with the tines of a fork.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until slightly browned, about 8 minutes. Do not overbake. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.
