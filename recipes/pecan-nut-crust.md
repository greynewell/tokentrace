## Ingredients

- 2 ½ cups ground pecans
- ¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ⅓ cup white sugar
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

## Instructions

1. Stir together ground nuts, cinnamon, and sugar. Mix in melted butter.
2. Press the mixture into the bottom and up the sides of a 9 inch, deep-dish style, pie pan. Chill the unbaked crust in the refrigerator for about 30 to 45 minutes.
3. Place pie crust on a cookie sheet, and position on the middle rack of a preheated 350 degree F (175 degree C) oven. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until lightly browned. WATCH it carefully, as nut crusts burn easily; they DON'T have to turn black to taste burnt! Cool completely before filling.
