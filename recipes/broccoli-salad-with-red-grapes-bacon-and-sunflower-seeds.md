## Ingredients

- 8 slices bacon
- ⅓ cup sunflower seed kernels
- 1 large head broccoli, cut into bite-size pieces
- ⅓ cup diced red onion
- 1 cup seedless red grapes, halved
- 1 cup mayonnaise
- 3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned and crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Crumble 7 slices of bacon; mix with sunflower seeds in a resealable plastic bag and set aside.

3. Whisk mayonnaise, vinegar, sugar, and pepper together in a separate bowl; crumble remaining slice of bacon and fold into dressing.
