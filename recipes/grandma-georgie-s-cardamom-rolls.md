## Ingredients

- 1 cup butter
- 1 ¾ cups boiling water
- 1 ½ cups white sugar
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 2 teaspoons ground cardamom
- 3 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
- 2  eggs, slightly beaten
- 7 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon vegetable oil

## Instructions

1. Cut the butter up into chunks, and place in a large mixing bowl. Pour the boiling water over the butter, and stir in the sugar, salt, and cardamom. Stir the mixture until the butter is melted and the sugar is dissolved, and let it cool down to about 105 degrees F/41 degrees C.
2. Beat the yeast, eggs, and flour into the butter-sugar mixture to make a runny dough, lightly oil the top of the dough, and cover with a cloth. Let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours.
3. Lightly grease a baking sheet, and set aside.
4. Punch down the dough, and knead until soft and springy, about 12 minutes. Form the dough into golf ball-sized rolls, and place them about 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheet. Let the rolls rise until double, about 1 hour.
5. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Bake the rolls in the preheated oven until the bottoms are browned and the tops are lightly golden, 12 to 15 minutes.
