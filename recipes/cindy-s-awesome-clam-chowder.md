## Ingredients

- ½ pound bacon, cut into 1/2 inch pieces
- 5  unpeeled potatoes, diced
- 2  carrots, diced
- salt and pepper to taste
- 2 (6.5 ounce) cans chopped clams with juice
- 2 (1.8 ounce) packages dry leek soup mix
- 1 quart half-and-half

## Instructions

1. Cook bacon in a large pot over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until crisped and browned, about 10 minutes. Transfer bacon with a slotted spoon to a paper towel-lined plate. Leave drippings in the pot.
2. Place potatoes and carrots into the pot and season with salt and pepper; cook in bacon drippings, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes.
3. Pour clam juice into the pot, add enough water to just cover potatoes, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until potatoes are just tender, 10 to 15 minutes.
4. Add leek soup mix and gently stir until no lumps remain. Stir in clams, half-and-half, and reserved bacon. Cook and stir until chowder returns to a simmer and thickens, about 10 minutes more.
