## Ingredients

- 1 ¾ cups warm water
- 2 tablespoons honey
- ¾ teaspoon active dry yeast
- 3 ½ cups whole wheat flour, or more as needed, divided
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 teaspoon sea salt

## Instructions

1. Mix the warm water, honey, and yeast in a stand-mixer bowl until mixture becomes foamy, about 5 minutes.
2. Add half the whole wheat flour, olive oil, and salt to the mixture. Mix with a spatula or wooden spoon until incorporated. Let sit for 1 to 2 minutes.
3. Mix with a dough hook attachment on low speed, slowly adding the remaining whole wheat flour, increasing the speed to high. Mix on high until the batter is combined and not sticking to the sides of the bowl, about 7 minutes. Cover the bowl with a towel and let rest for 15 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, prepare a 9x5-inch loaf pan with parchment paper. Flour a surface to work the dough.
5. Place the dough onto the floured work surface and shape into a loaf. Use more flour if necessary. Place into the prepared loaf pan.
6. Let shaped dough sit in a warm place until it has risen over the top of the pan, about 1 hour.
7. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
8. Bake in the preheated oven until top of the loaf sounds hollow when tapped, about 35 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 15 to 20 minutes before removing from the pan and transferring to a wire rack. Let cool an additional hour before slicing; otherwise it will feel doughy.
