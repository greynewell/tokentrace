## Ingredients

- 2 teaspoons red pepper flakes
- 1 teaspoon seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®)
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 cup cornmeal
- 4 (4 ounce) fillets swai fish
- 2 tablespoons canola oil
- ¼ cup water

## Instructions

1. Combine red pepper flakes, seafood seasoning, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Spread corn meal into a shallow bowl. Season swai fish with red pepper flake mixture and press each fillet into cornmeal to coat. Wrap coated fillets in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
