## Ingredients

- 1 cup soy milk
- 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar
- ½ cup warm water (100 to 110 degrees F/40 to 45 degrees C)
- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- 2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
- 5 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 cup mashed sweet potatoes
- ½ cup white sugar
- ¼ cup soy yogurt
- ¼ cup vegan butter (such as Earth Balance®), melted
- 2 tablespoons grated orange zest
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- nonstick cooking spray
- 2 cups firmly packed light brown sugar
- 1 cup chopped toasted pecans
- ¾ cup vegan butter (such as Earth Balance®), melted
- 2 tablespoons ground cinnamon
- ¼ cup vegan cream cheese substitute (such as Tofutti™)
- 1 ½ cups powdered sugar
- 3 tablespoons soy milk

## Instructions

1. Combine soy milk with apple cider vinegar; let sit for 5 minutes.
2. Combine water, sugar, and yeast for dough in a food processor fitted with the metal blade; pulse 4 times or until just combined. Remove the blade, scraping yeast mixture into the bowl. Let stand for 5 minutes.
3. Insert the short plastic dough blade. Add 1/2 cup of the flour and process for 2 minutes. Add 4 more cups flour, mashed potatoes, soy milk-vinegar mixture, sugar, soy yogurt, melted vegan butter, orange zest, salt, and baking soda; process for 2 minutes. Add remaining 1 cup flour and process until a dough forms and comes together to hold its shape, about 2 more minutes.
4. Transfer dough to a well-greased bowl; turn to coat all sides. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
5. Meanwhile, mix brown sugar, pecans, vegan butter, and cinnamon for filling together in a bowl. Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking pan.
6. Punch dough down and turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll into a 10x18-inch rectangle. Spread evenly with filling, leaving a 1-inch border around the top and bottom. Starting at one of the long sides, roll dough jelly-roll fashion. Cut into 12 equal slices and arrange in the prepared baking pan. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm, draft-free place for about 30 minutes.
7. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
8. Bake rolls in the preheated oven until golden brown, 17 to 20 minutes. Remove rolls from the oven and invert onto a baking sheet. Invert again onto a serving platter and let cool, 20 to 30 minutes.
9. While the rolls are cooling, beat cream cheese substitute until smooth. Mix in powdered sugar and soy milk until smooth.
10. Spread glaze on rolls. Serve warm.
