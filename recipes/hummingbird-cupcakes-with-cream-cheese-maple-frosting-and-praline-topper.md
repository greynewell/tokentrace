## Ingredients

- 2 cups white sugar
- 1 cup softened butter
- 3 large eggs
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 2 cups mashed ripe bananas
- ½ cup drained crushed pineapple
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ¾ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup sweetened shredded coconut
- 1 cup chopped pecans
- 1 ½ cups white sugar
- 1 ½ cups packed dark brown sugar
- 1 cup milk
- 3 tablespoons corn syrup
- 2 tablespoons butter
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 cup pecan halves
- 2 (4 ounce) containers Greek cream cheese, softened
- 1 cup softened butter
- 8 cups confectioners' sugar
- 3 tablespoons maple syrup

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 30 muffin tin cups with paper liners.
2. Cream 2 cups sugar, 1 cup butter, eggs, and vanilla extract together in a bowl. Combine mashed bananas and pineapple in a separate bowl. Combine flour, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt in a separate bowl.
3. Add flour mixture and banana mixture to the bowl with the butter mixture in alternating additions, mixing well after each. Stir in coconut and pecans. Fill lined muffin tin cups 2/3 full with batter.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until a cupcake top bounces back when pressed, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool completely on a wire rack.
5. Heat 1 1/2 cups white sugar, dark brown sugar, milk, corn syrup, 2 tablespoons butter, and salt in a heavy saucepan over medium heat to a soft-ball candy thermometer reading of 235 degrees F (112 degrees C). Remove from heat and add vanilla extract. Scoop caramel mixture onto a sheet of waxed paper while still warm. Add pecans while still warm and allow praline topping to cool before handling further.
6. Combine cream cheese, 1 cup butter, and maple syrup together in a bowl, scraping the sides down with a spatula. Add confectioners' sugar slowly until frosting is well mixed.
7. Add frosting to the tops of the cooled cupcakes and top with praline topping.
