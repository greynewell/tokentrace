- 9 ounces crabmeat
- 1  piquillo pepper, diced

## Instructions

1. Preheat frying oil to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) in a heavy-bottomed pot or fryer.

3. Mix until fully combined.
4. Unroll phyllo dough and cut into 4 sections, then place under a kitchen towel when not being used.
5. Take 3 to 4 sheets from one of the sections of phyllo and place on a clean work surface.
6. Place 1 to 2 tablespoons of filling in the lower center of the phyllo then fold it up over once to cover the filling.
7. Brush water around the edges.
8. Fold in the right and left edges toward the center to create an envelope, then fold it up toward the top to complete the 'package' and seal with a dab of water on the outside edge.
9. Repeat with remaining phyllo and filling.
