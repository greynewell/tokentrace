## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- ⅓ cup shortening
- 1 cup milk

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Whisk together flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Cut in shortening until the mixture resembles a coarse meal. Gradually stir in milk until dough pulls away from the side of the bowl.
3. Turn out onto a floured surface, and knead 15 to 20 times. Pat or roll dough out to 1 inch thick. Cut biscuits with a large cutter or juice glass dipped in flour. Repeat until all dough is used. Brush off the excess flour, and place biscuits onto an ungreased baking sheet.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until the edges begin to brown, 13 to 15 minutes.
