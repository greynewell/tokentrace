## Ingredients

- 2 (12 ounce) packages egg roll wrappers
- 1 (27 ounce) can whole green chiles - seeded, drained well, and patted dry
- 1 pound Monterey Jack cheese, cut into 3x1/2-inch thick strips
- vegetable oil for frying

## Instructions

1. Lay a wrapper on a work surface diagonally, so it resembles a diamond. Place a slice of green chile horizontally across wrapper, 1 inch above the bottom point. Lay a strip of Monterey Jack cheese on top of chile.
2. Dip an index finger into a small bowl of water and moisten the wrapper edges. Roll wrapper up and over chile and cheese, starting from the point closest to you. Bring in both sides, making sure to press firmly to seal filling. Continue rolling away from you to enclose filling. Repeat with remaining wrappers, chiles, and cheese.
3. Heat approximately 1/2 inch oil in a deep frying pan over medium heat.
4. Working in batches, fry rolls in hot oil, turning once, until golden brown on both sides, 2 to 3 minutes. Watch carefully to prevent burning. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Let cool for a few minutes before serving.
