## Ingredients

- 12  leaves cabbage
- 1 cup cooked white rice
- 1  egg, beaten
- ¼ cup milk
- ¼ cup minced onion
- 1 pound extra-lean ground beef
- 1 ¼ teaspoons salt
- 1 ¼ teaspoons ground black pepper
- 1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Boil cabbage leaves for 2 minutes; drain.
2. Combine ground beef, cooked rice, egg, milk, onion, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Spoon about 2 tablespoons of mixture onto each cabbage leaf. Bring one end of the cabbage leaf over the mixture, rolling and tucking in the ends to prevent filling from falling out; arrange rolls in a single layer in the slow cooker.
3. Mix tomato sauce, brown sugar, lemon juice, and Worcestershire sauce together in a small bowl until combined. Pour over cabbage rolls.
4. Cover and cook on Low for 8 to 9 hours.
