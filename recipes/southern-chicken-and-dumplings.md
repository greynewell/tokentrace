## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1  onion, diced
- 3 large bone-in chicken breast halves with skin
- 1 (32 ounce) can chicken broth
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt
- ⅓ cup vegetable shortening, plus
- 2 tablespoons vegetable shortening
- ¾ cup milk
- 1 (10.75 ounce) can  condensed cream of chicken soup
- 2 cups water
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper

## Instructions

1. Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in the onion, and cook until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Place the chicken breasts into the pot, skin-side-down. Pour in the chicken broth, and enough water to just cover the breasts. Bring to a simmer over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the chicken begins to fall off the bone, about 1 hour. Once cooked, remove the chicken breasts from the pot. Remove and discard the skin and bone; allow the meat to cool, then tear apart into bite sized chunks.
2. While the chicken breast are simmering, prepare the dumpling dough by whisking the flour, baking powder, and 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt together in a mixing bowl. Work the vegetable shortening in with your fingers until the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal. Make a well in the middle and pour in the milk. Stir together until a stiff dough forms. Turn out onto a floured surface, and knead until smooth. Form the dough into 12 pieces, and set aside.
3. After you've shredded the chicken, stir the cream of chicken soup, 2 cups water, salt, pepper, and shredded chicken back into the pot. Return to a simmer over medium-high heat. Drop the dumplings into the simmering broth one at a time to keep them from sticking together. Cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until the dumplings have puffed and are no longer doughy in the center, 10 to 20 minutes.
