## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups chocolate cookie crumbs
- ⅓ cup confectioners' sugar
- ⅓ cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- ¼ cup butter
- 3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
- 1 ¼ cups white sugar
- ¼ cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 3  eggs
- ½ cup sour cream
- ¼ cup Irish cream liqueur

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. In a large bowl, mix together cookie crumbs, confectioners' sugar, and 1/3 cup cocoa. Add melted butter and stir until well mixed. Pat into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes; set aside.
3. Increase the oven temperature to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
4. In a large bowl, combine cream cheese, white sugar, 1/4 cup cocoa, and flour. Beat at medium speed until well blended and smooth. Add eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Blend in sour cream and Irish cream liqueur; mixing on low speed. Pour filling over baked crust.
5. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C), and continue baking for 60 minutes.
6. With a knife, loosen the cake from the rim of the pan. Let cool, then remove the rim of the pan. Chill for at least 4 hours before serving. If your cake cracks, a helpful tip is to dampen a spatula and smooth the top, then sprinkle with some chocolate wafer crumbs.
