## Ingredients

- 3  eggs, room temperature
- ½ cup butter, softened
- 1 ½ cups white sugar
- 1 cup buttermilk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 2 teaspoons ground nutmeg
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ½ cup packed brown sugar
- 3 tablespoons cream
- ¼ cup butter
- 1 ½ cups confectioners' sugar

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease 2 (9-inch) round cake pans.
2. Make nutmeg cake: Beat butter and white sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy. The mixture should be noticeably lighter in color. Add eggs, one at a time, until well-blended. Stir in vanilla.
3. Sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda, nutmeg, and salt.
4. Pour 1/3 of the flour mixture into the bowl; mix just until incorporated. Stir in 1/2 of the buttermilk, mixing gently. Continue adding flour mixture alternately with buttermilk, mixing until combined. Spread batter into the prepared pans.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cakes comes out clean, about 25 to 30 minutes. Let cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then invert them on a wire rack to cool completely before icing.
6. Make caramel icing: Combine brown sugar, cream, and butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Boil for 2 minutes, then remove from heat and let cool.
7. Stir in confectioner's sugar and beat until smooth. Add more cream or confectioner's sugar to achieve desired spreading consistency.
