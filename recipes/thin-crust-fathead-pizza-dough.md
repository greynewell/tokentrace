## Ingredients

- 2 teaspoons yeast
- 2 tablespoons warm water
- 1 ½ cups shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese
- 1  large egg, lightly beaten
- 1 cup blanched almond flour
- 1 teaspoon xanthan gum
- ⅛ teaspoon salt

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Dissolve yeast in warm water in a bowl. Set aside for about 5 minutes.
3. Place mozzarella cheese into a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave for 90 seconds, stirring every 30 seconds until cheese is completely melted. Stir in yeast mixture and egg and stir to combine; mixture will not incorporate well at this point.
4. Stir in almond flour, xanthan gum, and salt. If mixture is difficult to mix, reheat in the microwave for 20-30 seconds to soften the cheese. Stir again until well incorporated. Using your hands, knead the dough for 2 minutes.
5. Place dough on baking sheet and press with your fingers into a thin crust, approximately 11-12 inches in diameter.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until crust is lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Remove from oven, top with your favorite pizza toppings, and return to the oven for 5 minutes, or until cheese is melted.
