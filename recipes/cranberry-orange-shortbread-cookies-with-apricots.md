## Ingredients

- 1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour
- ¼ teaspoon baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1 cup unsalted butter, softened
- ½ cup white sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 large  oranges, zested
- 1 cup finely chopped dried cranberries
- ½ cup finely chopped dried apricots

## Instructions

1. Combine flour, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg in a bowl; mix together.
2. Cream butter in a large bowl using an electric blender until fluffy and lightened in color slightly. Add sugar and cream on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, several more minutes. Mix in vanilla and orange zest. Add flour mixture in 3 batches and mix until just combined, kneading the last addition by hand. Knead in cranberries and apricots.
3. Divide dough in half and roll out into two 1 1/2x7-inch long logs. Wrap each log in parchment paper and refrigerate until dough is chilled, at least 4 hours.
4. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
5. Remove dough from the refrigerator and cut each log into about 16 slices that are 1/3-inch thick. Place slices 1 inch apart on prepared baking sheets.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until cookies just begin to turn slightly golden on bottom, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool on baking sheets for 5 minutes before removing to wire racks to cool completely. Store in an airtight container.
