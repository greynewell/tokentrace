## Ingredients

- ⅔ cup brown rice flour
- ⅔ cup cornstarch
- ⅔ cup tapioca flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon baking soda
- ¼ teaspoon xanthan gum
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 6 tablespoons vegetable shortening
- ⅔ cup white sugar
- ¾ cup skim milk
- 4 cups sliced fresh strawberries
- 2 cups reduced-fat whipped topping

## Instructions

1. Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Whisk the rice flour, cornstarch, tapioca flour, baking powder, baking soda, xanthan gum, and salt together in a bowl; set aside. Grease a baking sheet, or cover with a sheet of parchment paper.
2. Beat the shortening and sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Pour in the flour mixture alternately with the milk, mixing until just incorporated. Drop onto the prepared baking sheet into 8 equal portions.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown on the bottoms, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove, and cool on a wire rack to room temperature.
4. Once cool, slice each shortcake in half, and place each bottom half onto a dessert plate. Evenly divide the sliced strawberries onto each shortcake, and dollop with the whipped topping. Place the shortcake tops on to serve.
