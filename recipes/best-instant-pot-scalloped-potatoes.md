## Ingredients

- 2 pounds Yukon gold or red potato, cut into 1/4-inch slices
- 1 cup vegetable broth
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese, divided
- 3 tablespoons heavy cream
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon nutmeg

## Instructions

1. Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
2. Combine potatoes, vegetable broth, and salt in a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®). Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 1 minute. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
3. Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid.
4. Transfer potatoes carefully to an 8-inch square oven-safe deep dish. Combine 1 1/2 cups Cheddar cheese, cream, garlic powder, pepper, and nutmeg in the pressure cooker with the remaining liquid; select Saute function and cook until smooth and creamy, about 5 minutes. Pour sauce evenly over potatoes and sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese.
5. Broil in the preheated oven until golden, about 5 minutes.
