5. Stir apples, 2 tablespoons sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice together in a separate bowl; spoon evenly over filling.
6. Mix brown sugar, flour, walnuts, and cinnamon for streusel together in a bowl. Mix or cut butter into walnut mixture using your fingers or a knife until crumbly. Sprinkle over apple layer.
