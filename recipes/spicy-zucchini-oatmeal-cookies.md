## Ingredients

- 1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- 1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon
- ¼ teaspoon ground cloves
- ½ cup butter, softened
- ⅔ cup packed brown sugar
- 1  egg
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 cup quick cooking oats
- 1 cup shredded zucchini
- ½ cup raisins

## Instructions

1. Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease baking sheets.
2. Stir together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and cloves in a bowl; set aside. Beat the butter and brown sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until creamy. Add the egg and the vanilla extract. Mix in the flour mixture and oats until just incorporated.
3. Wring the zucchini in a clean towel to remove any excess moisture. Stir the zucchini and raisins into the dough; mixing just enough to evenly combine. Drop batter by rounded teaspoonfuls 2-inches apart onto the prepared baking sheets. Bake for 14 to 16 minutes or until the bottom edges turn golden brown.
