## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon green tea powder (matcha)
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup packed brown sugar
- ¾ cup unsalted butter, melted
- ½ cup white sugar
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- 1  egg
- 1  egg yolk
- 1 ½ cups white chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease baking sheets or line with parchment paper.
2. Sift flour, matcha, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Beat brown sugar, butter, and white sugar together in a large bowl using an electric mixer until blended; beat in vanilla extract, egg, and egg yolk until light and creamy.
3. Mix flour mixture into creamed butter mixture until dough is just blended; fold in chocolate chips using a wooden spoon. Drop cookie dough, 1 heaping tablespoon per cookie, onto the prepared baking sheet 2 to 3 inches apart.
