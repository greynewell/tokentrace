## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 pinch salt
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 cup buttermilk

## Instructions

1. Heat a heavy skillet, griddle, or cast-iron frying pan over medium-low heat.
2. Stir the flour and salt together in a bowl, and sift in the baking soda. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture, and pour in the buttermilk. Stir the mixture quickly together into a dough, and turn out onto a floured work surface. Knead the dough a few times, just until it comes together. Gently form the dough into a flattened, round cake about 1/2 inch thick, and cut the round into quarters with a floured knife.
3. Sprinkle a little bit of flour into the bottom of the hot skillet, and cook the wedges 6 to 8 minutes per side, until golden brown.
