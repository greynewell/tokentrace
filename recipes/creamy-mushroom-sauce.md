## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- ½ tablespoon olive oil
- 1 (10 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ¼ cup white wine
- 1 cup heavy cream
- ½ cup chicken broth
- ½ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
- 2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme

## Instructions

1. Heat butter and olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat until butter is melted. Add mushrooms and cook until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Season with garlic, salt, and pepper. Cook until garlic is fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour in wine, and allow to sizzle while scraping the browned bits of food off the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Cook until wine is mostly evaporated, about 1 minute.
2. Stir in cream and chicken broth, lower heat to medium, and simmer slowly, stirring occasionally, until sauce thickens but does not separate, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in thyme and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper, if needed.
