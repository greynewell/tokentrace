## Ingredients

- 7 large eggs
- ¼ cup heavy cream
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- ½ cup chopped onion
- 1 ½ cups chopped fresh broccoli
- 1 cup frozen diced hash brown potatoes, thawed
- 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
- 4 slices bacon, cooked and crumbled

## Instructions

1. Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Whisk eggs, cream, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Set aside.
3. Melt butter in a 12-inch nonstick, oven-proof skillet over medium-high heat until bubbly. Add chopped onion and cook until softened, 1 to 2 minutes. Add chopped broccoli and cook, stirring occasionally, about 2 minutes. Add potatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, about 2 minutes. Lightly season vegetables with additional salt and pepper.
4. Gently pat the vegetables into an even layer with the back of a spatula or spoon and turn off the heat. Sprinkle cheese over the vegetables, followed by bacon.
5. Pour the egg mixture into the skillet and gently shake to eliminate any holes around the vegetables. Let the residual heat cook the eggs slightly, about 2 minutes.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes. Check for doneness by using a knife to cut the center slightly. Eggs should not be runny enough to fill the cut. Allow to cool in the skillet for 5 minutes before serving.
