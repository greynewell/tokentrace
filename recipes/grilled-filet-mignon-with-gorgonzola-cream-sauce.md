## Ingredients

- 4 cups heavy cream
- 3 ounces crumbled Gorgonzola cheese
- 3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- ¾ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 4 (8 ounce) fillets beef tenderloin
- 1 pinch lemon pepper
- 1 pinch garlic powder
- 1 pinch onion powder
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 12 slices thick sliced bacon, chopped
- 4  green onions, chopped

## Instructions

1. Make sauce: Pour heavy cream into a saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat and simmer until cream is reduced by half, stirring occasionally, about 1 hour. Remove from heat; whisk in Gorgonzola cheese, Parmesan cheese, salt, pepper, and nutmeg until cheeses have melted. Cover to keep warm and set aside.
2. Prepare steaks: Season beef with lemon pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper; set aside to marinate.
3. Meanwhile, place bacon in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon on a paper towel-lined plate.
4. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat. Lightly grease the grate with cooking spray.
5. Cook steaks on the preheated grill until they begin to firm up and are reddish-pink and juicy in the center, 3 to 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for medium-rare. Transfer steaks to a plate; tent with foil to rest for 5 to 10 minutes.
6. Serve steaks with Gorgonzola sauce and top with bacon and green onion.
