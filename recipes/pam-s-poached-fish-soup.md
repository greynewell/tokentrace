## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon butter, or more to taste
- ⅓ cup diced onion
- ⅓ cup diced celery
- ⅓ cup diced carrot
- 4 cups chicken broth
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes with Italian herbs
- ⅓ cup white wine
- ⅓ cup lemon juice
- 1 pound tilapia fillets, or more to taste
- 1 ½ teaspoons dried Italian herbs
