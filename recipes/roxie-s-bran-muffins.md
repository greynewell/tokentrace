## Ingredients

- ½ cup raisins
- 1  egg
- ¾ cup milk
- 1 ½ cups bran cereal (such as Kellogg's All-Bran® Original Cereal)
- 1 cup whole wheat flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 2 tablespoons melted butter
- 1  apple, cored and shredded
- 1  ripe banana, mashed
- ½ cup honey

## Instructions

1. Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper cupcake liners.
2. Cover raisins with water in a microwave-safe bowl; microwave on High for 1 minute to plump. Drain raisins and set aside.
3. Beat egg with milk in a bowl; mix in bran cereal. Let mixture stand until cereal absorbs liquid, about 5 minutes. Gently mix in plumped raisins, flour, baking soda, cinnamon, melted butter, shredded apple, mashed banana, and honey; stir a few times to mix.
4. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups. Bake in the preheated oven for about 20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.
