## Ingredients

- 5  eggs
- 7 large potatoes, peeled and cubed
- 1 cup elbow macaroni
- 3 cups mayonnaise
- 1 tablespoon sherry vinegar  (Optional)
- 1 ½ teaspoons curry powder
- 1 teaspoon celery seed
- salt and black pepper to taste
- 2 cups grated carrots
- 1 cup frozen green peas, cooked, drained
- 1 small sweet onion, finely chopped

## Instructions

1. Place eggs into a saucepan in a single layer and fill with water to cover eggs by 1-inch. Cover the saucepan and bring water to a boil over high heat. Once water boils, remove the pan from heat and let eggs stand in hot water for 15 minutes. Pour out hot water, then cool eggs under cold running water in the sink. Peel and chop cooled eggs; set aside.
2. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain and set in the refrigerator to cool.
3. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once water is boiling, stir in macaroni and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain in a colander set in the sink; rinse with cold water.
4. Whisk together mayonnaise, vinegar, curry powder, celery seed, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl until smooth; set aside.
5. Combine cooled potatoes, macaroni, chopped eggs, carrots, peas, and onion in a large bowl. Carefully stir in dressing; cover and refrigerate overnight.
