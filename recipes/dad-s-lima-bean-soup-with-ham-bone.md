## Ingredients

- 1 (16 ounce) package dried lima beans
- 1  ham bone with some meat
- 8 cups water, or more as needed
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 4 stalks celery, diced
- 1  onion, diced
- ½ pound diced cooked ham
- 4  carrots, peeled and sliced
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon dried parsley

## Instructions

1. Combine ham bone and 8 cups water in a large saucepan. Simmer over medium-low heat until remaining meat falls off the bone, about 2 hours. Remove and discard bone. Use a slotted spoon to transfer meat to a bowl.
2. Meanwhile, place lima beans in a large pot; pour in enough cold water to cover. Bring to a boil; remove pot from heat, cover, and let stand for 1 hour. Drain and rinse beans.
3. Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add celery and onion; cook and stir until onion is translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add cooked ham bone meat, lima beans, and diced ham. Reduce heat and simmer, adding additional water as needed, until soup is thickened to desired consistency, about 90 minutes.
4. Stir carrots, salt, pepper, and parsley into the soup. Let simmer until carrots are soft, about 30 minutes more.
