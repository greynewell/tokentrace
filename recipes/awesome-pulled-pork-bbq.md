- 1 large onion, quartered
- 1  apple, cored and quartered
- 3 stalks celery
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth

## Instructions

1. Place pork in a slow cooker and season to taste with garlic powder, poultry seasoning, salt, and pepper. Add quartered onion, apple, and 3 celery stalks. Pour chicken broth into slow cooker.
