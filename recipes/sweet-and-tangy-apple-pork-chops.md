## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons honey mustard
- 1 teaspoon mustard powder
- ½ teaspoon ground cumin
- ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper  (Optional)
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 pound pork chops
- 2 tablespoons butter

## Instructions

1. Mix brown sugar, honey mustard, mustard powder, cumin, cayenne pepper, and garlic powder together in a small bowl; rub onto pork chops and let sit on a plate for flavors to dissolve into pork chops, about 10 minutes.
