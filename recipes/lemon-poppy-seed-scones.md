## Ingredients

- 2 ¾ cups self-rising flour
- 1 stick very cold unsalted butter, cut into cubes
- 2 tablespoons poppy seeds
- ½ cup white sugar
- 1 tablespoon lemon zest, or more to taste
- 1 large egg, beaten
- 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
- ⅓ cup whole milk, or more as needed
- 3  strawberries, or more to taste
- 1 cup powdered sugar, or more as needed

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Place self-rising flour in a large bowl. Cut in butter using a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add poppy seeds, sugar, and lemon zest; mix to combine. Make a well in the center and pour in egg, lemon juice, and milk. Mix with a fork until dough starts to come together. Scoop up with one hand until a shaggy dough forms.
3. Pour dough out onto your work surface. Use your hands and a bench scraper to gather and press dough into a neat rectangle about 1- to 1-1/2-inches tall. Cut into 4 squares and then diagonally into 8 triangles. Space scones evenly onto a silicone-lined baking sheet.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until bottoms are golden brown, about 25 minutes. Let cool in pan for 5 minutes, then transfer onto a wire rack to cool completely, about 30 minutes.
5. Mash strawberries finely to resemble a puree. Whisk in powdered sugar in batches to make a thick, spreadable glaze. Spread glaze over the cooled scones. Let scones cool on the rack until glaze hardens, about 20 minutes.
