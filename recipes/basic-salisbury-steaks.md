## Ingredients

- 1 pound ground beef
- ⅓ cup dry bread crumbs
- 1  egg
- 1 (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1 (10.75 ounce) can  condensed golden mushroom soup
- 1 (10.75 ounce) can  water

## Instructions

1. Mix ground beef, bread crumbs, egg, and onion soup mix together in a bowl; shape into 6 oblong patties.
2. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook patties until browned, about 5 minutes per side.
3. Stir golden mushroom soup and water together in a bowl; pour over the patties in the skillet. Turn patties to coat in the liquid. Bring liquid to a simmer, reduce heat to medium-low, place a cover on the skillet, and cook until steaks are very firm, hot, and grey in the center, 10 to 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
