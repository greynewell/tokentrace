## Ingredients

- ½ pound bacon
- 1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 10 tablespoons whole milk
- 2 teaspoons whole milk
- 1  egg yolk
- ⅛ teaspoon maple syrup

## Instructions

1. Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon grease into a small glass container and chill until set, at least 1 hour. Cut bacon strips into 1/4-inch slices.
2. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
3. Combine flour and 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon baking powder in a large bowl. Measure out 6 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons chilled bacon grease into the bowl. Knead grease into the flour mixture with one hand, turning bowl with the other, until dough is crumbly.
4. Make a well in the center of the dough and slowly pour in 10 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons milk. Mix with one hand until milk is incorporated and dough feels wet to the touch. Form dough into a thick disc. Cut into 16 equal-sized pieces with a knife.
5. Roll dough into individual balls and place them on the baking sheet. Flatten them into circles about 2 1/2 inches in diameter. Place a tablespoon of bacon slices in the center of 8 circles. Top with remaining circles of dough. Seal so that the top circle meets the bottom using your fingertips.
6. Whisk egg yolk with maple syrup in a bowl; brush over sides and top of each scone. Let scones rest, about 15 minutes.
7. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes.
8. Place a clean towel on a plate, transfer scones to the towel and fold towel over to keep warm.
