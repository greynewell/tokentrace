## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups diced carrots
- 1 ½ cups diced onion
- 1 ½ cups diced celery
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce
- ⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon black pepper
- 3 cups chicken broth
- 2 cups beer
- ⅓ cup butter
- ⅓ cup flour
- 4 cups milk or half and half
- 6 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce

## Instructions

1. Place carrots, onion, celery, and garlic in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in hot pepper sauce, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Pour in chicken broth and beer; simmer until vegetables are tender, about 12 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, melt butter in a large soup pot over medium-high heat. Stir flour into melted butter with a wire whisk; cook and stir until flour is light brown, 3 to 4 minutes.
