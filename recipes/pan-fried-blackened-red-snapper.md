## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon sweet paprika
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 1 tablespoon ground black pepper
- 1 tablespoon onion powder
- 2 teaspoons garlic powder
- 2 teaspoons lemon pepper
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper, or more to taste
- ¼ cup olive oil
- 2 tablespoons butter

## Instructions

1. Mix paprika, salt, black pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, lemon pepper, and cayenne pepper together in a small bowl.
2. Combine olive oil and butter in a small, microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave until butter is melted, about 1 minute. Stir to blend butter into the oil.
