## Ingredients

- 2 cups elbow macaroni
- 2 teaspoons vegetable oil
- 1 pound lean ground beef
- ⅓ cup chopped onion
- 1 ½ cups frozen corn
- 1 (6.5 ounce) can tomato sauce
- ½ cup ketchup
- ½ cup water
- 2 teaspoons chili powder
- ½ teaspoon white sugar
- ½ teaspoon seasoned salt
- ½ cup grated Cheddar cheese

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain.
2. Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir beef and onion in the hot oil until beef is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Add corn, tomato sauce, ketchup, water, chili powder, sugar, and seasoned salt to the beef mixture; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes.
3. Stir macaroni into beef mixture; cook until heated through, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle with Cheddar cheese; remove from heat and let stand until cheese melts, 1 to 2 minutes.
