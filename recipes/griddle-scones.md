## Ingredients

- 4 cups all-purpose flour
- ¾ teaspoon baking soda
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ cup shortening or lard
- 1 tablespoon corn syrup
- 1 ½ cups buttermilk, or as needed

## Instructions

1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, sugar, and salt. Cut in the shortening with a fork, pastry blender, or by pinching between your fingers. Make a well in the center, and pour in the corn syrup and buttermilk. Stir with a sturdy spoon to form a soft dough. Divide the dough in half, and pat out into 3/4 inch thick circles on a floured surface. Cut each circle into 6 wedges.
2. Heat a griddle over medium heat, and grease lightly with cooking spray or oil. Cook scones on each side, then stand them on edge, and cook all three edges. Cool on a wire rack.
