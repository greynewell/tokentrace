## Ingredients

- ½ teaspoon vegetable oil, or as needed
- 1 pound ground sirloin
- 3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
- 1  egg
- ⅓ cup dry bread crumbs
- ½ small onion, chopped

- ¼ cup butter, divided
- 1 (16 ounce) package mushrooms, sliced
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 (10.5 ounce) can beef broth
