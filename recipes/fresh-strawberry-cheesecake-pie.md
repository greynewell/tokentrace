## Ingredients

- 1 (9 inch) unbaked deep dish pie crust
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- 2  eggs
- ½ cup white sugar
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- ½ cup white sugar
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch
- ¾ cup water
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 2 tablespoons strawberry-flavored Jell-O® mix
- 1 quart fresh strawberries, hulled and sliced

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Bake pie crust until lightly browned, about 10 minutes.
3. Remove crust from oven and turn oven temperature down to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
4. Beat cream cheese, eggs, 1/2 cup sugar, and 2 tablespoons lemon juice in a bowl until smoothly combined.
5. Pour filling into crust.
6. Bake until filling is set, about 30 minutes.
7. Remove from oven and let cool completely.
