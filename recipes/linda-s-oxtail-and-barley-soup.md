## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 pounds oxtails
- 8 cups water
- 4 tablespoons beef bouillon granules
- 1 tablespoon sazon seasoning with annatto
- 1 tablespoon dried parsley
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 2 medium potatoes, cubed
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
- 1 large parsnip, sliced
- 12  mushrooms, quartered
- 1 large onion, chopped
- ¾ cup barley
- 2 stalks celery, chopped
- 1 large carrot, sliced
- 2  bay leaves

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a heavy frying pan over medium-high heat. Saute oxtails in the hot oil, turning until browned on all sides, about 3 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels.
2. Transfer oxtails to a large Dutch oven or soup pot. Add water, bouillon, sazon, parsley, garlic, and pepper. Bring to a boil. Lower heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 1 hour. Add more water if necessary.
3. Remove oxtails to a plate to cool. Skim the grease off the surface of the soup, using a gravy separator if desired. Add potatoes, tomatoes, parsnip, mushrooms, onion, barley, celery, carrot, and bay leaves to the soup. Bring to a boil; lower heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes.
4. While the vegetables are cooking, cut as much meat as possible off the oxtail bones. Add the chopped meat and the bones back to the soup. Simmer for another 20 minutes. Remove bones and bay leaves from the soup before serving.
