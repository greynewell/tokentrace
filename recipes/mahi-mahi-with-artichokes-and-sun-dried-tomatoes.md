## Ingredients

- ¼ cup butter
- 2 tablespoons finely chopped shallot
- ¼ cup finely chopped garlic
- 6 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
- 3 tablespoons dry white wine
- kosher salt to taste
- ground black pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons chopped sun-dried tomatoes
- 2 tablespoons artichoke hearts, drained and chopped
- 2 tablespoons cold butter, cut into pieces
- 1 cup all-purpose flour, or as needed
- 1 teaspoon seasoned salt, or to taste
- 2 (3 ounce) fillets mahi mahi fillets
- 1 tablespoon olive oil

## Instructions

1. Make sauce: Melt 1/4 cup butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir shallot and garlic in butter until soft and fragrant, about 5 minutes.
2. Pour lemon juice and white wine into the skillet; season with kosher salt and black pepper. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until liquid reduces enough to stick to the back of a spoon, 20 to 30 minutes.
3. Stir tomatoes and artichoke hearts into reduced sauce; cook until warmed through, 2 to 3 minutes more. Remove the skillet from heat, add cold butter pieces, and swirl the skillet off heat until butter melts and emulsifies into sauce. Cover and keep warm.
4. Make fish: Stir flour and seasoned salt together in a wide, shallow bowl. Dredge mahi-mahi fillets in flour mixture to coat.
5. Heat olive oil in a separate skillet over medium heat. Fry mahi-mahi in hot oil until fish flakes easily with a fork in the center, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer mahi-mahi to a platter; top with sauce.
