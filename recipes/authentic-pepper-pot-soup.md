## Ingredients

- 1 pound honeycomb tripe
- 5 slices bacon, diced
- ½ cup chopped onion
- ½ cup chopped celery
- 3  leeks, chopped
- 1 bunch fresh parsley, chopped
- 2  green bell peppers, diced
- 2 quarts beef stock
- ¼ teaspoon dried thyme
- ½ teaspoon dried marjoram
- ½ teaspoon ground cloves  (Optional)
- ¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
- 1  bay leaf
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 large potato, peeled and diced
- 2 large carrots, diced
- 4 tablespoons margarine
- 4 tablespoons all-purpose flour

## Instructions

1. Place the tripe or other meat that you have selected to use in a saucepan, and cover with water. Bring to a boil, and turn off the heat. Allow the meat to cool a bit in the water, and then drain and rinse. Cut into 1/4 inch pieces.
2. In a large heavy kettle, saute the bacon until clear. Add the onion, celery, leeks, parsley, and green peppers; saute until tender.
3. Stir in beef stock, thyme, marjoram, cloves, red pepper flakes, bay leaf, and black pepper. Bring the kettle to a boil, and turn down to a simmer. Cook, covered, until meat is very tender, about 2 hours.
4. Add the diced potato and carrots, and cook for an additional 20 minutes.
5. Prepare the roux by stirring the flour into the melted butter or margarine, and cooking for a moment on the stove. When the soup is done to your liking, stir in the roux. Simmer, stirring all the while, until the soup thickens a bit. Correct the seasonings.
