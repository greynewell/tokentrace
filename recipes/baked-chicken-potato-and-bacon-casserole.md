## Ingredients

- nonstick cooking spray
- 6 slices bacon
- 4 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, cut into wedges
- 2 pounds boneless chicken thighs
- sea salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ⅓ cup olive oil
- 1 tablespoon dried thyme
- 1 tablespoon dried rosemary

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
2. Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels.
3. Arrange potatoes in an even layer on the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Season chicken thighs with salt and pepper, then arrange on top of the potatoes. Drizzle the chicken dish with olive oil; sprinkle with thyme and rosemary. Crumble the bacon over the top of the dish.
