## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups warm water
- 1 ½ cups warm milk
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 1 (.25 ounce) envelope active dry yeast
- 2 ½ cups oat flour
- 2 cups whole wheat flour
- 1 teaspoon salt

## Instructions

1. Place warm water and warm milk into a large bowl. Stir in sugar and yeast, and let stand for 5 minutes, or until frothy. Mix in oat flour, whole wheat flour and salt, blending thoroughly. Cover bowl, and let stand in a warm place for 1 hour.
2. Heat a large griddle or two skillets over medium heat, and grease well. Spoon enough batter onto the pan to make a thin pancake about 8 inches across for each one. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the top surface is covered with holes. Turn over and brown on the other side. Place oatcakes on a warm plate until ready to serve. Best served immediately, but can be frozen and heated later.
