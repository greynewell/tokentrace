## Ingredients

- 2  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 6 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- 4  zucchini, cut into 1 1/2-inch sticks
- 1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo beans, drained and rinsed
- 1 (6 ounce) can black olives, drained and sliced
- 1 (14 ounce) can artichoke hearts, drained and chopped
- ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese

## Instructions

1. Season both sides of chicken breasts with salt and black pepper.
2. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook chicken breasts in the hot oil until they are no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, 5 to 10 minutes per side.
3. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a breast should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
4. Cut chicken into 1/2-inch cubes and transfer to a large bowl.
5. Heat remaining 4 tablespoons olive oil in the same skillet over medium heat; cook and stir zucchini in the hot oil until slightly tender, about 5 minutes.
6. Season with salt and black pepper.
7. Transfer zucchini to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.
8. Mix zucchini, garbanzo beans, olives, artichoke hearts, and Parmesan cheese with chicken; toss to combine.
9. Chill in refrigerator before serving, about 1 hour.
