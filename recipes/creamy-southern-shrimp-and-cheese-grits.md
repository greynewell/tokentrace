## Ingredients

- 3 ½ cups water
- 1 cup quick-cooking grits
- 3 ounces farmers cheese
- 2 ounces goat cheese
- 1 slice American cheese
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 teaspoons vegetable oil
- 1 large tomato, diced
- 2  green onions, sliced
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon bacon drippings, or to taste  (Optional)
- 1 pound fresh shrimp - peeled, deveined, and tails removed
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ¼ cup half-and-half, or more to taste

## Instructions

1. Bring water to a boil in a large saucepan and slowly whisk in grits; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until thickened and tender, 5 to 7 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir farmers cheese, goat cheese, and American cheese into grits until cheese has melted. Set grits aside and keep warm.
2. Melt butter with vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir tomato, 2 green onions, and garlic in the hot skillet until the vegetables are tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in bacon drippings until combined. Cook and stir shrimp with vegetables until bright pink, about 5 minutes; season to taste with salt and black pepper.
3. Mix grits into shrimp mixture and stir in half-and-half until smooth. Simmer the mixture to blend flavors, about 5 minutes, and add sherry. Simmer 3 more minutes before adjusting salt and black pepper. Garnish with sliced green tops of 1 green onion before serving.
