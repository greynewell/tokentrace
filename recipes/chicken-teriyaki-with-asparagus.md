## Ingredients

- ¾ cup honey teriyaki sauce
- ¼ cup white wine
- 4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- 16 spears fresh asparagus
- 4 slices Swiss cheese

## Instructions

1. In a large bowl, mix the honey teriyaki sauce and wine. Place chicken in the bowl, and coat with the marinade. Cover, and marinate in the refrigerator at least 1 hour (it is best if you can marinate overnight).
2. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
3. Discard marinade, and arrange chicken breasts in a baking dish. Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until almost done.
4. Place the asparagus in a pot fitted with a steamer basket over 1 inch of boiling water, and steam 5 minutes, until tender.
5. Place 4 asparagus spears on each chicken breast, and top each breast with a slice of Swiss cheese. Return to oven, and continue baking 10 minutes, or until cheese is melted and chicken juices run clear.
