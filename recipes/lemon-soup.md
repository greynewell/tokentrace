## Ingredients

- 1 (48 fluid ounce) can chicken broth
- 2  egg yolks
- 2  egg whites
- 1  lemon, juiced
- salt and pepper to taste
- 1 cup uncooked orzo pasta

## Instructions

1. Pour chicken broth into a large pot, and bring to a boil. Add orzo pasta, and simmer for 10 minutes, until tender.
2. In a medium glass or metal bowl, whip egg whites to medium stiff peaks. Stir in egg yolks and lemon juice. When the pasta has finished cooking, Gradually ladle about 1 cup of the soup into the egg mixture while stirring gently. This will heat up the eggs so they will not be shocked by the boiling liquid.
