## Ingredients

- 1 pound fresh morel mushrooms - dirt gently brushed off and mushrooms halved lengthwise
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 cup vegetable shortening
- salt to taste

## Instructions

1. Place halved morel mushrooms in a large bowl; cover with cold, lightly salted water. Refrigerate mushrooms for about 5 minutes to loosen any dirt; pour off salted water, rinse, and repeat twice more. Crevices of the mushrooms may harbor tiny stones or even insects. Thoroughly rinse mushrooms a final time and allow to drain on paper towels.
2. Place flour in a shallow bowl.
3. Heat vegetable shortening in a large skillet until very hot.
4. Roll mushrooms in flour and tap off excess; gently lay mushrooms in the hot shortening.
5. Pan-fry until golden brown and flour coating is crisp, 5 to 8 minutes, turning often. Drain morels on paper towels, salt to taste, and enjoy your treasures!
