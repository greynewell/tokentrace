## Ingredients

- 4 large potatoes
- 1  yellow onion
- 1  egg, beaten
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- ground black pepper to taste
- 2 cups vegetable oil for frying

## Instructions

1. Finely grate potatoes and onion into a large bowl. Drain off any excess liquid.
2. Mix in egg, salt, and pepper. Add enough flour to make the mixture thick, about 2 to 4 tablespoons all together.
3. Preheat the oven to low, about 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).
4. Heat 1/4 inch oil in the bottom of a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Drop two or three 1/4-cup mounds of batter into hot oil, and flatten with back of a spatula to make 1/2-inch-thick pancakes. Fry, turning pancakes once, until golden brown.
5. Transfer pancakes to a plate lined with a paper towel to drain. Keep warm in the oven until serving. Repeat until all potato mixture is used.
