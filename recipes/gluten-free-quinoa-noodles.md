## Ingredients

- 1 cup quinoa flour
- 1 cup rice flour
- 2 teaspoons xanthan gum
- 1 teaspoon dried basil  (Optional)
- 1 teaspoon dried rosemary  (Optional)
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano  (Optional)
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 2  eggs
- 1  egg yolk
- ⅓ cup water
- 1 teaspoon olive oil
- ⅓ cup rice flour, divided

## Instructions

1. Mix quinoa flour, 1 cup rice flour, xanthan gum, basil, rosemary, oregano, and salt together in a large bowl; make a well in the center.
2. Whisk eggs and egg yolk together in a small bowl. Mix in water and olive oil. Pour into the well in the flour mixture; mix thoroughly until a dough forms.
3. Lightly dust a work surface with 2 1/2 tablespoons rice flour. Knead dough until smooth and elastic, 8 to 12 minutes. Cover dough and let rest, about 10 minutes.
4. Divide dough into 4 equal pieces. Dust work surface with remaining 2 1/2 tablespoons rice flour. Roll each piece of dough into a square shape that is about 1/16-inch thick. Let dough rest, uncovered, for 20 minutes.
5. Roll each square of dough up loosely; slice into 1/4-inch pieces. Unroll noodles.
6. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook noodles until tender yet firm to the bite, about 2 minutes.
