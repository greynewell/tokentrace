## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 2 pounds chicken wings
- ½ teaspoon salt, or more to taste
- ⅓ cup all-purpose flour
- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
- ½ cup hot sauce
- ½ tablespoon red wine vinegar
- ½ tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- ½ tablespoon honey
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 2 stalks celery, sliced, or to taste
- 2  carrots, sliced, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and coat with nonstick cooking spray.
2. Pat chicken wings dry using paper towels. Season with salt. Place flour in a shallow dish and dredge chicken to lightly coat. Place wings on the prepared baking sheet.
