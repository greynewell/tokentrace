## Ingredients

- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 cup light cream
- 1 cup lemonade
- flour for dusting

## Instructions

1. Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Place the flour in a mixing bowl with a hollow in the middle; add the cream and lemonade; mix until combined into a very sticky dough.
3. Pour the mixture onto a floured surface; roll with a floured rolling pin until the mixture is approximately 1 inch thick.
4. You may need to sprinkle extra flour on top, given the stickiness of the mixture.
5. Cut into rounds and place on a floured baking sheet with each round a few centimeters apart.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until the tops of the scones are lightly browned and sound slightly hollow if you tap them, about 15 minutes.
