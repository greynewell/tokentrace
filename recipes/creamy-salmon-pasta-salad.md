## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon butter
- ¼ cup dry white wine
- 1  onion, sliced
- 10 ounces salmon fillets
- 1 ½ cups elbow macaroni
- ¾ cup mayonnaise
- 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
- ½ teaspoon celery salt
- ½ teaspoon paprika
- 1 pinch ground black pepper to taste
- 1 cup thinly sliced celery
- ½ cup grated carrot
- ½ cup diced red pepper
- ½ cup frozen peas, thawed and drained
- ¼ cup thinly sliced green onions

## Instructions

1. Melt butter in a medium pot over high heat. Add wine to the pot and allow half to cook off, 2 to 3 minutes.
2. Cover the bottom of the pot with onion slices. Score the skin side of the salmon to prevent curling. Lay salmon on the onion slices, skin side up. Reduce heat to low and cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), 10 to 12 minutes. Remove salmon from the pot and let cool.
3. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, place mayonnaise, white wine vinegar, celery salt, paprika, and pepper in a medium bowl. Stir well. Remove 1/2 of the dressing and refrigerate until serving.
5. Drain macaroni and add to the bowl of dressing; turn to coat. Add celery, carrot, red pepper, peas, and green onions. Turn to coat. Remove skin from the salmon and cut into rough chunks. Add to the macaroni and stir gently. Chill for at least 2 hours.
6. Add remaining dressing to the salad and toss. Taste and adjust salt, if necessary.
