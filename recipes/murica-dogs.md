## Ingredients

- 6  Italian sausage links
- 2 teaspoons vegetable oil, or as needed
- 1  jalapeno pepper, diced small
- 3 tablespoons butter, or to taste, divided
- 1 large white onion, minced
- ⅔ cup kimchi, cut into thin strips
- 6  hoagie rolls, split lengthwise

## Instructions

1. Put sausages into a skillet and pour enough water into the skillet so the sausages are 2/3 covered.
2. Bring water to a boil, place a cover on the skillet, and cook sausages, turning every few minutes, until no longer pink in the center, 8 to 10 minutes.
3. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
4. Pour enough oil into a separate skillet to just cover the bottom; heat over medium-high heat.
5. Saute jalapeno pepper in hot oil until softened, 3 to 4 minutes.
6. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in the skillet with the jalapeno pepper.
7. Once butter is hot, cook onion in hot butter until softened, 4 to 5 minutes.
8. Reduce heat to medium-low, add the kimchi, and cook until soft, 1 to 2 minutes.
9. Put skillet with sausages over medium heat.
10. Pour onion mixture into the skillet with the sausages.
11. Return now-empty skillet to medium heat.
12. Melt enough butter in the skillet to cover bottom completely.
13. Grill hoagie buns in batches, adding butter between batches as needed, in skillet until toasted, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
14. Put a sausage into each toasted bun.
15. Spoon vegetable mixture over each sausage.
