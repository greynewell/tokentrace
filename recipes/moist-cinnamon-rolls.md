## Ingredients

- 1 cup warm milk
- 1  egg
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 3 ⅓ cups bread flour
- 1 ½ teaspoons active dry yeast
- ⅓ cup butter
- ½ cup brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons milk
- 1 cup chopped walnuts
- ¼ cup butter, melted
- ½ cup brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- ½ cup chopped walnuts
- ½ cup raisins

## Instructions

1. Place milk, egg, butter, sugar, salt, flour and yeast in bread machine pan. Make sure you add yeast last. Set bread machine on Dough cycle and begin.
2. In a medium sauce pan, melt 1/3 cup butter over medium-low heat. Stir in 1/2 cup brown sugar, 2 tablespoons milk and 1 cup walnuts. Stir constantly until well blended. Pour this sauce in a 9x13 inch pan; set aside.
3. After the cycle is complete, put the dough on a lightly floured board, and roll the dough into a rectangle about 10x15. Brush the dough with melted butter and sprinkle with brown sugar, cinnamon, nuts and raisins.
4. Roll the dough up tightly like a jelly roll, starting with the long side. Press the edges to seal. With a knife, or preferably a long piece of dental floss, cut the roll into one inch pieces. Place the pieces in the prepared pan on top of the caramel sauce.
5. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until double in size, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
6. Bake in preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes, until brown. Remove from oven and immediately turn upside down onto a platter.
