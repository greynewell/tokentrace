## Ingredients

- 1 large eggplant, cut into 1/2 inch cubes
- ¾ teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 cup tomato-vegetable juice cocktail (such as V8®)
- ¼ cup red wine vinegar
- ½ cup red wine
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- ¼ cup chopped fresh parsley
- 4  anchovy fillets, minced, or to taste
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
- ¼ cup raisins
- ½ cup pitted black olives, chopped
- ½ cup pitted green olives, chopped
- ½ cup zucchini, diced
- ½ cup yellow squash, diced
- 2  celery stalks, diced
- ½  red bell pepper, diced
- ½ cup grated carrot
- 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- ½  red onion, finely diced
- ½ cup pine nuts
- ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese

## Instructions

1. Toss the eggplant with the kosher salt and spread out onto a microwave-safe plate. Cook in the microwave on High until the eggplant is dry and has shriveled to 1/3 of its original size, about 15 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and set aside.
2. Whisk the tomato juice cocktail, vinegar, red wine, brown sugar, parsley, and anchovies together in a large bowl. Stir in the tomatoes, raisins, black olives, green olives, zucchini, yellow squash, celery, red bell pepper, and carrot; set aside.
3. Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in the eggplant and cook, stirring occasionally, until the edges have browned, 4 to 8 minutes. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil along with the celery and onion. Cook and stir until the onion has softened, about 4 minutes more. Stir in the vegetable mixture and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer uncovered until the liquid thickens and begins to coat the vegetables, 4 to 7 minutes more. Scrape into a bowl and stir in the pine nuts. Refrigerate to room temperature. Sprinkle with the Parmesan cheese and serve.
