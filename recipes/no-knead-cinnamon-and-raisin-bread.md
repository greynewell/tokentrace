## Ingredients

- 3 cups bread flour
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon table salt
- ½ teaspoon dry instant yeast
- 1 ½ cups warm water (110 degrees F (43 degrees C))
- ¾ cup golden raisins
- 1 tablespoon bread flour
- parchment paper

## Instructions

1. Stir 3 cups flour, sugar, cinnamon, salt, and yeast together in a large bowl. Pour in water and stir until all the flour has been incorporated and a shaggy, wet dough forms. Stir in raisins and cover with plastic wrap.
2. Place bowl in a warm, draft-free space for 30 minutes or in the oven with the oven light on.
3. Sprinkle a clean working surface with 1 tablespoon flour. Scrape dough out onto the counter and use a bench scraper to fold the dough over onto itself several times, incorporating most of the flour into the dough. Rinse and dry the bowl.
4. Cut parchment paper into a liner for the bowl, folding it so that it sits flat against the bowl. Place dough on the parchment paper in the bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise for 30 minutes.
5. Meanwhile, place a 5-quart Dutch oven into the oven and preheat to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Set timer for 30 minutes.
6. Remove warmed Dutch oven from the oven and transfer dough with the parchment liner into the Dutch oven. Cover with a lid.
7. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Uncover and bake for 5 minutes more. Remove from oven and carefully transfer bread onto a wire rack. Remove parchment paper. Cool completely before slicing, about 2 hours.
