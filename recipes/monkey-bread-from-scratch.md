## Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon vegetable oil, or as needed
- ¼ cup warm water
- 2 ½ teaspoons active dry yeast
- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- 3 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- ¾ cup milk, warmed
- 1  egg
- 3 tablespoons white sugar
- 2 tablespoons melted butter
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 ½ cups brown sugar
- 1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon
- ½ cup butter, melted

## Instructions

1. Lightly grease a fluted tube pan (such as Bundt) with vegetable oil; set aside.
2. Make dough: Combine warm water, yeast, and 1 teaspoon sugar in a large bowl. Let stand until bubbly and foamy, about 5 minutes.
3. Stir in 1 cup flour, warm milk, egg, 3 tablespoons sugar, butter, salt, and vanilla extract until combined. Add remaining 2 1/2 cups flour. Mix and knead until dough comes together in a ball. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place for 30 minutes.
4. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and punch down gently to deflate. Divide dough into small or medium balls.
5. Make coating: Mix together brown sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Dip each dough ball in melted butter, remove with a fork, then roll in cinnamon sugar mixture until well coated.
6. Arrange coated dough balls in the prepared pan. Cover with plastic wrap or a damp cloth and let rise until almost doubled in size, about 45 minutes.
7. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
8. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 35 minutes. Invert onto a large plate; cool for 10 minutes before serving.
