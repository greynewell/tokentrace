## Ingredients

- 2 cups white sugar
- 1 cup margarine
- 4 large eggs
- 2 cups sour cream
- 3 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 4 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking soda
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- ⅔ cup cocoa powder
- ¾ cup white chocolate chips
- ¾ cup dark chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Grease and flour a 12-cup fluted tube pan (such as Bundt®).
2. Whip sugar and margarine together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating briefly after each addition. Mix in sour cream and vanilla extract.
3. Sift flour, baking soda, and baking powder together in a separate bowl. Add flour mixture in 4 batches, beating batter thoroughly after each addition.
4. Remove about 2 1/2 cups batter to a small bowl and add cocoa powder. Stir until dark in color. Stir in white chocolate chips.
5. Stir dark chocolate chips into the light-colored batter. Layer the 2 batters, starting with the light-colored batter, into the prepared Bundt® pan.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until the top is golden brown and a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour 20 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 20 minutes. Run a table knife around the edges to loosen. Invert carefully onto a serving plate or cooling rack.
