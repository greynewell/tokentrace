## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons sesame oil, divided
- 2 large skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cubed
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 large bell pepper, cut into 1/2-inch squares
- ½  sweet onion, cut into 1/2-inch squares
- 1 cup teriyaki sauce

- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ cup cashew pieces
