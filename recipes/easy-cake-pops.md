## Ingredients

- 1 (15.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix (such as Betty Crocker®)
- 1 cup water
- 3  eggs
- ½ cup vegetable oil
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- lollipop sticks
- 1 (14 ounce) bag chocolate confectioners' coating

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
2. Beat cake mix, water, eggs, and vegetable oil together in a bowl using an electric mixer on low speed for 30 seconds; increase speed to medium and beat until batter is smooth, about 2 minutes more. Pour batter into the prepared baking dish.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 28 to 33 minutes. Cool cake completely, at least 1 hour.
4. Crumble cake into a large bowl and mix in cream cheese. Roll cake mixture into about 40 to 50 quarter-size balls. Insert a lollipop stick into each cake ball and arrange on a baking sheet; refrigerate until chilled, at least 30 minutes.
5. Melt chocolate in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 15-second intervals, stirring after each melting, 1 to 3 minutes.
6. Dip each cake ball into melted chocolate until coated. Arrange cake pops on a baking sheet to dry.
