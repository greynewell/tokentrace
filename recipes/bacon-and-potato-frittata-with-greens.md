## Ingredients

- 6 slices bacon, chopped
- 1  potato, peeled and sliced into thin 1-inch pieces
- 2 tablespoons water, or as needed
- 1 clove garlic, thinly sliced
- ½ teaspoon red pepper flakes
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 bunch Swiss chard, chopped
- 8  eggs, beaten
- ⅓ cup grated Parmesan cheese

## Instructions

1. Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
2. Cook and stir bacon in a large oven-proof skillet over medium heat until evenly browned and crispy, about 10 minutes. Drain all but 1 teaspoon bacon grease from the skillet.
3. Stir potato slices, water, garlic, red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper into bacon; cover the skillet with a lid and cook until potatoes are tender, about 10 minutes.
4. Mix Swiss chard into potato mixture; cook and stir until chard is slightly wilted, 2 to 3 minutes.
5. Pour eggs over potato-chard mixture, stir gently, and remove skillet from heat. Top egg mixture with Parmesan cheese.
