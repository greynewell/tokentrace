## Ingredients

- 20  chicken wings
- 2 tablespoons olive oil, or more as needed
- 3 teaspoons garlic salt
- 3 teaspoons ground black pepper

## Instructions

1. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.
2. Tuck in the chicken wing flaps so the wing forms a triangle.
3. Combine olive oil with some of the garlic salt and pepper in a large bowl. Add a few chicken wings and turn to coat with seasonings. Add more wings, remaining garlic salt, and remaining pepper and turn to coat. Repeat until all wings are coated. Place on the preheated grill.
4. Grill until wings are well browned, tender, and no longer pink at the bone and juices run clear, turning several times and rearranging them so they cook evenly, 30 to 40 minutes.
