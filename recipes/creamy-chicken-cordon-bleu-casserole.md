## Ingredients

- 1 (8 ounce) package wide egg noodles
- 2 cups chopped cooked chicken breast
- 8 ounces cooked ham, cubed
- 8 ounces Swiss cheese, cubed
- 1 (10.75 ounce) can  reduced-fat, reduced-sodium cream of chicken soup (such as Campbell's® Healthy Request)
- ½ cup 2% milk
- ½ cup light sour cream
- 2 tablespoons butter
- ⅓ cup seasoned bread crumbs
- ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch casserole dish.
2. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain and transfer noodles to the prepared casserole dish; top with chicken, ham, and Swiss cheese.
3. Mix cream of chicken soup, milk, and sour cream together in a bowl; spoon soup mixture over noodle mixture.
4. Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese in the melted butter until crumbs are coated with butter and cheese, 2 to 3 minutes. Sprinkle bread crumb mixture over casserole.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until casserole is bubbling and lightly browned, about 30 minutes. Allow casserole to cool for 10 minutes before serving.
