## Ingredients

- 1 cup butter, softened
- ⅔ cup white sugar
- ⅔ cup packed brown sugar
- 2 cups mashed sweet potatoes
- 1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
- 4  eggs, beaten
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ½ teaspoon ground ginger
- ½ teaspoon ground cloves
- 2 cups baking mix (such as Bisquick ®)
- 2 tablespoons baking mix (such as Bisquick ®)
- 1 cup chopped pecans

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9x5-inch loaf pans.
2. Beat butter, white sugar, and brown sugar together in a bowl until smooth. Stir in sweet potatoes, sweetened condensed milk, eggs, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and cloves until well blended.
