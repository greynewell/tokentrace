## Ingredients

- 2 cups gingersnap cookie crumbs
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 5 tablespoons melted butter
- 1 (.25 ounce) envelope unflavored gelatin
- ⅔ cup lime juice
- 2 ½ cups heavy cream, divided
- 9 ounces white chocolate, chopped
- 3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
- 1 cup white sugar
- 2 tablespoons grated lime zest

## Instructions

1. Combine cookie crumbs and sugar in a large bowl. Pour in melted butter, and mix thoroughly. Press into the bottom and one inch up the sides of a 10-inch springform pan.
2. Sprinkle the gelatin over the lime juice in a small bowl, and set aside to soften. Bring 1/2 cup of whipping cream to a simmer in a heavy pan. Remove from heat, and pour over the chopped white chocolate. Let soften for two minutes, then whisk until smooth. Mix the gelatin into the warmed chocolate until melted; set aside to cool to room temperature. Beat remaining 2 cups of cream to stiff peaks in a large bowl, and set aside.
