## Ingredients

- ¼ cup unsalted butter
- 2 pounds sliced fresh mushrooms
- 1 pinch salt
- 1  yellow onion, diced
- 1 ½ tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 6 sprigs fresh thyme
- 2 cloves garlic, peeled
- 4 cups chicken broth
- 1 cup water
- 1 cup heavy whipping cream
- 1 pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves for garnish, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Melt butter in a large soup pot over medium-high heat. Sauté mushrooms and 1 pinch salt in the melted butter until mushrooms release their juices, 5 to 10 minutes.
2. Reduce heat to medium-low and continue to cook, stirring often, until juices evaporate and mushrooms are caramelized, 15 to 25 minutes. Set aside a few attractive mushroom slices for garnish later, if desired.
3. Add onion to the mushrooms; cook until onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.
4. Stir flour into the mushroom mixture and cook, stirring often, to remove the raw flour taste, about 2 minutes.
5. Add thyme bundle and garlic cloves, then pour in 4 cups chicken broth and 1 cup water. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 1 hour. Remove and discard thyme bundle.
6. Puree soup with an immersion blender until smooth and thick. Stir in cream. If too thick, add a little chicken broth or water. Season with salt and black pepper.
7. Ladle into bowls, and garnish with reserved mushroom slices and thyme leaves.
