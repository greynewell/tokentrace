## Ingredients

- ⅓ cup pomegranate juice
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce, or to taste
- 1 clove garlic, sliced
- 4 (6 ounce) fillets salmon
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- ½  pomegranate, peeled and seeds separated

## Instructions

1. Whisk pomegranate juice, soy sauce, and garlic together in a shallow non-reactive bowl until marinade is well mixed. Add salmon and turn to coat. Cover and marinate for 15 minutes.
2. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; add garlic from the marinade and cook until lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour in the marinade and cook until reduced and thickened to a glaze, 4 to 5 minutes.
3. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
4. Cook salmon on the preheated grill until flesh flakes easily with a fork, about 3 minutes per side. Serve salmon topped with glaze and garnished with pomegranate seeds.
