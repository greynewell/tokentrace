## Ingredients

- 2 cups instant brown rice
- 1 ¾ cups water
- 6 tablespoons soy sauce
- 6 tablespoons water
- ¼ cup honey

- 2 tablespoons cornstarch
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic, chopped
- 2 cups broccoli florets
- 1 cup baby carrots
- 1 small white onion, chopped
- ½ teaspoon black pepper
- 1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms

## Instructions

1. Stir rice and water together in a microwave-safe bowl. Cover and cook in the microwave on high until water is fully absorbed, about 8 minutes. Fluff with a fork; cover and set aside.

3. Heat olive oil in a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Stir in garlic and cook for 10 seconds.

Remove vegetables from the skillet and set aside.
4. Return the skillet to heat and pour in sauce mixture; cook for 1 minute. Add shrimp and stir until shrimp are bright pink on the outside, meat is no longer transparent, and sauce thickens, about 3 minutes. Stir vegetables into the pan and serve over brown rice.
