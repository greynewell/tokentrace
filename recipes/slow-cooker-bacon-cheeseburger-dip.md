## Ingredients

- 8 ounces bacon
- ½ pound ground beef
- 1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, cut into cubes
- 1 (8 ounce) package shredded Cheddar-Monterey Jack cheese blend
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

## Instructions

1. Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Remove bacon to a plate lined with paper towels, reserving drippings in the skillet.
2. Break ground beef into the skillet; cook and stir until completely browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain beef, return the skillet to the stove, and reduce heat to low.
3. Stir diced tomatoes with green chile peppers, cream cheese, and shredded Cheddar-Monterey Jack cheese blend into ground beef. Crumble bacon and stir most of it, reserving a few teaspoons for garnish, into beef mixture; cook and stir until cheese begins to melt, 2 to 3 minutes; transfer to a slow cooker.
4. Cook on Low until hot and bubbly, 2 to 3 hours. Stir parsley into dip. Garnish with reserved bacon. Keep in the slow cooker set to Low to serve.
