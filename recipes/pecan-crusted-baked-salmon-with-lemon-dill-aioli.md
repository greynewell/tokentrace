## Ingredients

- 1 pound salmon fillets
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ½ cup mayonnaise
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic
- 1 teaspoon chopped fresh dill
- ½ medium lemon, juiced
- ½ cup pecans

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Cut salmon into smaller, equal-sized portions if needed. Pat dry. Season with salt and pepper.
3. Mix mayonnaise, garlic, dill, and lemon juice together in a bowl. Season with salt.
4. Place the pecans in a food processor. Pulse for 1 second and check the size of the pieces. You want it to be not quite powdery, but still with some larger chunks. Continue to pulse in 1-second bursts until desired consistency is achieved.
5. Place the salmon on a baking sheet. Layer the top of the salmon with aioli, then with pecans, until completely covered.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, 15 to 20 minutes.
