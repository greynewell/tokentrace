## Ingredients

- 1 gallon chicken stock
- 4  bone-in chicken breast halves
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 3  eggs
- 2 tablespoons water, or as needed
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 pinch salt

## Instructions

1. Bring chicken stock to a boil; cook chicken breasts at a boil until no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove chicken, cool, and cut meat from bone; keep chicken stock at a low simmer.
2. Mix flour and 1/4 teaspoon salt together using the dough hook attachment in the bowl of a stand mixer on Low; add eggs and water, 1 tablespoon at time, until dough holds together.
3. Split dough in half. Roll 1 dough half on a lightly floured surface to 1/8-inch thickness. Cut dough into noodles 2 to 3-inches long x 1/4-inch wide using a sharp knife dipped in flour or a fettuccine pasta cutter. Repeat with other dough half.
4. Return chicken to the simmering stock; add noodles. Season stock with black pepper and 1 pinch salt. Cook soup until noodles are cooked through, 15 to 25 minutes.
