## Ingredients

- 6 cups chicken broth, or as needed
- 3 cups water, or as needed
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided
- 1 cup brown rice
- 1 cup wild rice
- ½ pound fresh morel mushrooms, chopped, divided
- 2  carrots, diced
- 2 stalks celery, diced
- 1  onion, diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- ½ cup dry white wine
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- ¼ cup heavy cream
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon grated Pecorino Romano cheese, or to taste  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Bring chicken broth and water to a boil in a large stockpot over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to low and keep warm until needed.
2. While the broth is heating, heat olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter over in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. When butter melts, add brown rice; cook and stir constantly until toasted, about 5 minutes. Stir in wild rice, 1/2 of the morel mushrooms, carrots, celery, onion, and garlic. Cook, stirring constantly, until onion is translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour in white wine; cook until evaporated, 2 to 3 minutes.
3. Stir 1/2 of the warm broth mixture into rice until combined. Cover and cook over medium heat until thickened, about 30 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes. Pour in remaining broth mixture, remaining mushrooms, and thyme. Cover and continue to cook over medium heat, stirring every 5 minutes, until wild rice is tender, 30 to 40 minutes.
4. Stir in cream and remaining 1 tablespoon butter; cook until butter melts, about 1 minute more.
5. Season with salt and pepper, then sprinkle Pecorino Romano cheese over top.
