## Ingredients

- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
- ½ cup confectioners' sugar
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 12 large fresh strawberries, hulled
- 2 tablespoons graham cracker crumbs
- 2 (1 ounce) squares semisweet chocolate chips  (Optional)
- 1 teaspoon canola oil  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Line a baking sheet with waxed paper.
2. Beat together the cream cheese, confectioners' sugar, and vanilla extract in a bowl until smooth.
3. Spoon the mixture into a piping bag fitted with a large round tip.
4. With a sharp paring knife, cut a cone shape out of the top of each strawberry to leave a small hollow.
5. Pipe about 1 tablespoon of the cream cheese filling into each strawberry, making sure that the filling overflows a bit out of the top of the strawberry.
6. Place the graham cracker crumbs into a shallow bowl. Dip the filled side of the strawberry into the graham cracker crumbs, coating the exposed filling with crumbs.
7. Melt the chocolate and canola oil in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring after each interval, until warm and smooth, 1 to 3 minutes (depending on your microwave).
8. Dip the unfilled ends of the strawberries into the melted chocolate and place on the prepared baking sheet; refrigerate until set.
