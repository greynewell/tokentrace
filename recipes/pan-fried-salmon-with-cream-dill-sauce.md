## Ingredients

- 4 (4 ounce) fillets salmon
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 1 ½ tablespoons lemon juice, divided
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill
- ¾ cup heavy whipping cream, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Season salmon with salt and pepper and sprinkle with some of the lemon juice.
2. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Melt butter and oil together in the hot skillet. Add salmon; pan-fry for 3 minutes. Flip and cook until salmon is almost cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes.
3. Sprinkle remaining lemon juice onto one side of the pan. Add mustard and dill and mix. Pour in cream, mix with a spoon, and tilt pan so sauce runs around the salmon fillets. Cook for a few minutes until sauce thickens. Season with salt. Serve salmon with sauce.
