## Ingredients

- 5 cups bread flour, divided, or as needed
- 1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle warm beer
- ¼ cup warm water
- 3 tablespoons shortening
- 1 tablespoon instant yeast
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- 1 tablespoon olive oil, or to taste, divided
- 2 tablespoons cornmeal, or as needed
- 16 sticks string cheese

## Instructions

1. Combine 4 cups bread flour, beer, water, shortening, yeast, brown sugar, salt, garlic powder, and onion powder in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment; mix until combined. With the mixer running, add remaining flour, a little at a time, until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl and forms into a ball, about 2 minutes.
2. Lightly grease a large bowl with 1 teaspoon olive oil. Place dough into the bowl. Cover with a clean towel and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
3. Grease 2 pizza pans with remaining 2 teaspoons olive oil; dust with cornmeal.
4. Punch dough down gently and divide into 2 equal portions. Place each portion onto a prepared pan. Cover and let rest for about 5 minutes.
5. Stretch each dough out 1 inch past the edge of the pan. If dough shrinks back when stretched, cover and let rest for 5 more minutes before stretching again.
6. Arrange 8 sticks cheese, ends touching, around the edge of 1 pan. Fold overhang over cheese and press dough to seal. Repeat with the second pan.
