## Ingredients

- ⅓ cup white sugar
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1  egg, beaten
- 1 cup milk
- ⅓ cup vegetable oil

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
2. Mix together 1/3 cup sugar and 2 teaspoons cinnamon in a small bowl; set aside.
3. Combine flour, remaining 1 cup sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Combine egg, milk, and oil in a separate bowl; add to flour mixture. Stir until just moistened.
4. Pour 1/2 of the batter into the prepared pan. Sprinkle with 1/2 of the reserved cinnamon-sugar mixture. Repeat with remaining batter and cinnamon-sugar mixture. Draw a knife through batter to marble.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes.
