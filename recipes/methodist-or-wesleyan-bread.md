## Ingredients

- 2 teaspoons white sugar
- 1 cup lukewarm water
- 2 (.25 ounce) envelopes active dry yeast
- ¾ cup molasses
- 4 teaspoons salt
- 6 tablespoons white sugar
- ¼ cup shortening, melted
- 3 cups lukewarm water
- 2 cups raisins
- 12 cups sifted all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons caraway seed

## Instructions

1. Dissolve 2 teaspoons of sugar in 1 cup of water. Sprinkle the yeast over the water and allow to soften for 5 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, stir together the molasses, salt, 6 tablespoons of sugar, and shortening into the remaining 3 cups of water in a large bowl until dissolved. Add the raisins, flour, and caraway seed.
2. Mix together until a dough forms, then turn out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead until smooth and elastic, 10 to 15 minutes. Place into a well oiled bowl, and brush the top with a little melted shortening. Cover with a cloth and allow to rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.
3. Punch down, and allow to rise again until doubled in bulk, another hour.
4. Lightly grease two 9x5 inch loaf pans. Place the dough on a lightly floured work surface, punch down, then form into two loaves. Place loaves into the pans, cover with a cloth, and allow to rise again until doubled in size.
5. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
6. Bake loaves in preheated oven for 1 hour until they are nicely browned and sound hollow when tapped on the bottom.
