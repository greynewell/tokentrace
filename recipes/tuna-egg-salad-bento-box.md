## Ingredients

- 1 (5 ounce) can water-packed tuna, drained and flaked
- ½ cup canola mayonnaise
- 1  hard-boiled egg, chopped
- 2 tablespoons finely chopped sweet onion
- 2 tablespoons chopped hamburger dill pickle chips
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 2  tomatoes
- 1  banana, sliced
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- toothpicks
- 1 (4 ounce) can pineapple chunks, drained
- 6  strawberries
- 2  carrots, divided

- 1  hot hard-boiled egg, peeled

## Instructions

1. Combine tuna, mayonnaise, chopped egg, onion, pickle chips, and salt in a bowl to make tuna-egg salad.
2. Place tomatoes on a flat work surface. Cut slits from the top towards the bottom to make partial wedges. Fill tomatoes with tuna salad.
3. Dip banana slices in lemon juice. Thread a toothpick through a banana slice, pineapple chunk, and strawberry. Repeat assembling kebabs with the remaining fruit.
4. Cut 1 carrot and 1 cucumber into 3/4-inch circles. Cut each carrot slice into the shape of a tulip using a small knife. Trim cucumber slices into leaves. Thread a leaf through a toothpick; insert a tulip on top. Repeat with the remaining leaves and tulips.
5. Cut the other carrot and cucumber into 1/2-inch slices. Cut out mini carrot and cucumber flowers using a mini flower-shaped vegetable cutter.
6. Place the hot egg in a heart-shaped egg mold; close the lid slowly and tightly. Soak the mold in a bowl of cold water for 10 minutes. Remove egg and drain on a paper towel.
7. Arrange tuna-egg salad, fruit kebabs, tulips, carrot and cucumber cut-outs, and heart-shaped eggs in a bento box.
