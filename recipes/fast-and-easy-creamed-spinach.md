## Ingredients

- 2 teaspoons olive oil
- 2 (16 ounce) bags fresh spinach
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
- 1 pinch freshly grated nutmeg
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 2 tablespoons minced shallot
- ¾ cup heavy whipping cream
- 1 teaspoon freshly grated lemon zest
- 2 tablespoons finely shredded Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Heat olive oil in a large soup pot over high heat; add spinach, cover, and cook for 1 minute. Uncover and gently stir until most of the leaves are bright green and wilted, about 2 minutes. Quickly drain spinach in a strainer and transfer to a plate lined with 4 or 5 paper towels. Once cool enough to handle, squeeze as much liquid from the spinach as possible. Transfer spinach to a cutting board and coarsely chop.
2. Mix cayenne pepper, nutmeg, salt, and black pepper in a small bowl.
3. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat; stir in shallot and cook until just barely golden and translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in seasoning mixture and pour in cream; increase heat to medium-high and simmer until the cream sauce reduces by about half, about 5 minutes. Stir in lemon zest.
4. Reduce heat to low and toss spinach with cream sauce in skillet. Cook and stir until spinach is heated through and coated, about 2 minutes. Stir in Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese until thoroughly combined. Serve immediately.
