## Ingredients

- 1 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 teaspoon anise extract
- 1 teaspoon lemon extract
- 3 large eggs
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 3 teaspoons baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup powdered sugar
- 2 tablespoons milk
- 2 tablespoons multicolored candy sprinkles, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Beat butter and sugar together until creamy. Stir in anise extract and lemon extract. Blend in eggs. Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in another bowl; blend into egg mixture until dough is almost crumbly but stays together when you roll it in your hands.
3. Form dough into 1-inch balls and place 2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheets.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until edges are set and golden, about 15 minutes. Remove from the oven. Cool on the baking sheet briefly before removing to a wire rack to cool completely, about 15 minutes.
5. Meanwhile, combine powdered sugar and milk in a bowl. Glaze cooled cookies and top with sprinkles.
