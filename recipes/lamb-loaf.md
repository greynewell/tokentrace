## Ingredients

- ½ teaspoon vegetable oil
- 2 slices dry bread, diced
- ½ teaspoon vegetable oil, or as needed
- ¼ cup milk
- 1 pound ground lamb
- 1  egg
- 4 cloves minced garlic
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tablespoon lemon zest
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- 1 teaspoon dried rosemary, crushed
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ¼ cup tomato sauce
- 5 leaves fresh mint, finely chopped
- 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan with oil.
2. Place bread and milk in a small bowl. Press bread with a fork to soak up the milk.
3. Combine lamb, egg, garlic, thyme, Worcestershire sauce, lemon zest, coriander, basil, rosemary, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl. Add soaked bread; discard the leftover milk. Mix with hands until well combined. Transfer meatloaf to the prepared pan.
4. Combine tomato sauce and mint; spread evenly over the meatloaf. Drizzle with balsamic vinegar.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 35 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Remove and let cool for 5 minutes before serving.
