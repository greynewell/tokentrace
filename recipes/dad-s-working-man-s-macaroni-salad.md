## Ingredients

- 2 cups elbow macaroni
- 6 slices American cheese
- 4  thick slices beef bologna
- 5  hard-cooked eggs, diced
- 6  sweet pickles, diced
- 1 large stalk celery, diced
- ½ large green bell pepper, seeded and diced
- 1 small red onion, diced
- 1 ½ cups low-fat creamy salad dressing (such as Miracle Whip Light®)
- 2 tablespoons prepared yellow mustard

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.

3. Drain and cool under running water until chilled.
4. Transfer to a large salad bowl.
