## Ingredients

- 2 ½ teaspoons kosher salt
- 1 (5 pound) prime rib roast, bones removed
- 5 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 tablespoons cracked black pepper
- 2 teaspoons garlic powder
- 2 teaspoons dried rosemary
- 2 teaspoons dried thyme
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper

## Instructions

1. Sprinkle salt over entire roast; wrap roast in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 4 hours to overnight.
2. Combine olive oil, black pepper, garlic powder, rosemary, thyme, onion powder, paprika, and cayenne pepper in a bowl. Set aside for flavors to blend, about 1 hour.
3. Pour 3/4 of the oil mixture over roast; massage into the top and sides of meat. Flip roast; pour remaining oil mixture over roast and massage. Place roast on a plate and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 12 hours.
4. Preheat the smoker to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C) to 230 degrees F (107 degrees C). Add hickory or pecan wood chips to the smoker.
5. Insert an oven-safe meat thermometer into the thickest part of roast. Place roast into the smoker and cook until internal temperature reaches 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), 3 to 3 1/2 hours.
6. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C) to 550 degrees F (288 degrees C).
7. Bake roast in the preheated oven until crust is crunchy, producing a reverse sear, 15 to 20 minutes. Allow roast to rest for 10 to 15 minutes before slicing.
