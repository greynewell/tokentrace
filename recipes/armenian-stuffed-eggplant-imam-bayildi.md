## Ingredients

- 2 large eggplants
- ¼ cup olive oil, divided
- 1  red bell pepper, cut into 1-inch strips
- ½  onion, sliced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2  tomatoes, chopped
- 1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce with no salt added
- ⅛ teaspoon salt
- ⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 pinch chopped fresh parsley, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
2. Cut eggplants in 1/2, then cut each 1/2 into thirds, leaving 12 eggplant spears total. Place on a baking sheet and brush with 2 tablespoons olive oil.
3. Roast in the preheated oven until fork tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
4. While eggplants are cooking, heat remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium heat in a medium to large pan. Add bell pepper, onion, and garlic to the hot pan and cook until onions become tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in tomatoes and cook until most of the liquid has evaporated, 2 to 3 minutes. Set aside to cool.
5. Remove eggplants from the oven and let cool slightly, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer eggplants to a 9x13-inch baking dish. Slice each spear vertically using a fork and knife, being careful not to cut through skin. Pry each open and fill with 2 to 3 tablespoons of tomato filling. Cover with tomato sauce.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling, about 30 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Garnish with parsley.
