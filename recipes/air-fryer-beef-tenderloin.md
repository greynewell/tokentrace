## Ingredients

- 2 pounds beef tenderloin, at room temperature
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon cracked black pepper

## Instructions

1. Preheat the air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Pat beef tenderloin dry with paper towels.
2. Place tenderloin on a plate. Drizzle oil all over the beef and sprinkle with oregano, salt, and pepper. Rub spices and oil into the meat. Place the roast in the air fryer basket by folding it to make it fit. Close the basket.
3. Reduce heat to 390 degrees F (198 degrees C). Air fry for 22 minutes. Reduce heat again to 360 degrees F (182 degrees C). Cook for 10 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 135 degrees F (57 degrees C) for medium.
4. Remove tenderloin from the basket and place on a plate. Allow to rest, uncovered, for at least 10 minutes before serving.
