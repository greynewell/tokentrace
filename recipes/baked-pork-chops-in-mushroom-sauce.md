## Ingredients

- 6 (4 ounce) pork loin chops
- 1  olive oil cooking spray
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon paprika
- ½ teaspoon chili powder
- 1 (26.5 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Heat a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Spray pork chops with cooking spray and season with garlic powder, paprika, and chili powder. Brown chops in the hot skillet, turning frequently, until lightly browned on both sides, 5 to 8 minutes total. Transfer to a casserole or baking dish.
