## Ingredients

- 1 (16 ounce) package hot dogs
- 8 slices  sourdough bread
- ½ cup butter, softened
- 4 slices sharp Cheddar cheese, or to taste
- 20  dill pickle slices, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Slice hot dogs length-wise leaving the skin intact to hold the two halves together.

4. Arrange bread slices on a sheet of waxed paper; spread butter onto 1 side of each slice.
5. Flip and butter the other sides.
6. Place a slice of Cheddar cheese onto each of 4 bread slices; add pickle slices and 1 hot dog atop each cheese slice.
7. Top each hot dog with a sourdough slice.
8. Heat a skillet over medium heat; place sandwiches, 1 at a time, into the hot skillet and cook until cheese is melted and bread is toasted, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
9. Add weight to the sandwiches by placing a heavy plate on them while cooking, if necessary.
10. Slice sandwiches diagonally to serve.
