## Ingredients

- 6 ounces white chocolate, chopped
- 2 cups heavy whipping cream
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste
- 1 tablespoon boiling water
- 1 ½ teaspoons unflavored gelatin powder
- 4 ounces fresh strawberries, quartered
- ¼ cup orange juice
- 2 teaspoons white sugar

## Instructions

1. Combine white chocolate, heavy cream, 1 tablespoon sugar, and vanilla bean paste in a saucepan over low heat; cook and stir until chocolate has melted and mixture is smooth, 5 to 7 minutes.
2. Place boiling water in a small bowl. Sprinkle gelatin powder over water and stir until dissolved. Stir gelatin mixture into white chocolate mixture until smooth.
3. Ladle white chocolate mixture into six 1/2-cup ramekins. Cover with plastic wrap and chill until set, about 4 hours.
