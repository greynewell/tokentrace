## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 4  eggs, beaten
- ½ cup half-and-half
- ½ cup milk
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- 1 (8 ounce) loaf French bread, cut into small cubes
- ¼ cup butter
- 3  Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored, and cut into small dice
- ¼ cup brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare a 7x11-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
2. Beat eggs, half-and-half, milk, white sugar, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl; add bread cubes and stir to coat. Let soak until bread is moist, at least 10 minutes.
3. Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir apples and brown sugar into the melted butter to moisten the sugar completely; add cinnamon and cook, stirring regularly, until the apples are warmed yet still firm, 5 to 7 minutes.
4. Stir apple mixture into the bread mixture; pour into the prepared baking dish.
5. Bake in preheated oven until golden on top and still somewhat soft in the center, 35 to 45 minutes.
