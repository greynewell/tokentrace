## Ingredients

- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 cup packed brown sugar
- 1 cup butter, softened
- 2  eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 2 cups rolled oats
- 1 cup roasted and salted sunflower seeds
- 1 cup flaked coconut  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. In a large bowl, cream together the white sugar, brown sugar, and butter until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla.
