## Ingredients

- 4 large eggs
- ½ cup mayonnaise
- ¼ teaspoon kosher salt
- ¾ teaspoon white sugar
- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- 3 dashes hot sauce, or to taste
- 1 teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juice
- 2 teaspoons rice vinegar
- ½ teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste
- ¼ teaspoon white sugar
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper
- 1 tablespoon heavy cream
- 4 slices soft white bread
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, softened

## Instructions

1. Place eggs in the bottom of a saucepan. Add 1/4 inch of water. Heat over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Cover and steam for 11 minutes. Turn off the heat and drain water carefully; pour cold water over and let cool.
2. Mix mayonnaise, salt, sugar, mustard, hot sauce, lemon juice, and vinegar for Kewpie-style mayonnaise together. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until needed.
3. Peel eggs. Mash in a shallow bowl with the side and back of a fork until desired texture is reached. Add salt, sugar, cayenne, heavy cream, and 3 tablespoons Kewpie-style mayonnaise. Stir to combine. Wrap and refrigerate until well chilled, at least 1 hour. Taste and adjust seasonings.
4. Butter bread slices and use 1/2 of the egg salad on each sandwich. Cut crusts off before serving if you're fancy.
