## Ingredients

- 1  whole chicken
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 2 sprigs rosemary
- 3 cloves garlic, peeled
- 1  lemon, halved

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
2. Pat chicken dry and sprinkle salt on all sides and inside the cavity. Sprinkle with black pepper. Pluck the leaves from 1 spring of rosemary and sprinkle on the chicken. Place the other whole sprig inside the cavity along with garlic and lemon.
3. Place the chicken on a roasting rack set inside a roasting pan.
