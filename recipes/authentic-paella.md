## Ingredients

- 2 ½ cups uncooked white rice
- 6 cups chicken stock, divided
- 3 cloves garlic
- 1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley
- ½ teaspoon curry powder
- 5  saffron threads
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ¼ cup olive oil
- 1  onion, diced
- 1 (3 pound) whole chicken, cut into small pieces
- 2 cups peeled and deveined small shrimp, diced
- 6 small lobster tails
- ½ pound clams in shell, scrubbed
- 1 (8 ounce) jar mushrooms, drained
- 1 cup green peas
- 1 (2 ounce) can mussels

## Instructions

1. Rinse the rice with cold water; drain; set aside. Bring the chicken stock to a boil in a saucepan over medium-high heat, reduce the heat to low, cover, and keep warm. Work the garlic, parsley, curry powder, saffron threads, salt, black pepper, and 1/2 cup of the hot chicken stock together with a mortar and pestle until a smooth liquid forms; set the seasoning liquid aside.
2. Heat the olive oil in a paella pan over medium-high heat; cook and stir the onion until lightly browned. Stir in the chicken, shrimp, lobster, and clams; cook and stir until the chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes. Pour in the seasoning liquid.
3. Stir in the rice, pour in the hot chicken stock, and simmer until the rice is nearly tender, about 15 minutes. Add mushrooms, peas, and mussels; stir two times, and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from heat; cover and let stand until rice is soft and flaky, about 7 minutes.
