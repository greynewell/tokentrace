## Ingredients

- 1 cup milk
- ½ cup sourdough starter
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ cup unbleached all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon cornmeal, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Stir milk and sourdough starter together in a large bowl until mostly smooth. Mix in flour. Cover bowl and leave to ferment at room temperature, 8 hours to overnight.
2. Add sugar, baking soda, and salt to the preferment, stirring just enough to incorporate. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Knead for 4 to 5 minutes, adding as much of the 1/2 cup flour as needed to make the dough workable.
3. Use a rolling pin to flatten dough to an even 1/2-inch thickness. Cut into 4-inch rounds using a clean tuna can or biscuit cutter; keep edges well floured to avoid sticking.
4. Sprinkle a thin layer of cornmeal over a sheet of waxed paper. Arrange cut-outs over the cornmeal. Sprinkle a thin layer over the dough. Let rest for 45 minutes.
5. Heat a griddle or cast iron skillet over medium-low heat. Cook English muffins until lightly browned, 5 to 6 minutes. Cool on a wire rack.
