## Ingredients

- 1 pound Brussels sprouts, trimmed and cut in half
- 2 large sweet potatoes, cut into wedges
- 1 medium sweet onion, cut into wedges
- 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- 1 ¼ teaspoons kosher salt, divided
- ¾ teaspoon ground black pepper, divided
- 4 (5 ounce) bone-in, skin-on chicken pieces
- 2 tablespoons grainy mustard
- 4 teaspoons champagne vinegar
- 1 tablespoon maple syrup
- ½ teaspoon kosher salt
- ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil.
2. Prepare chicken and veggies: Toss Brussels sprouts, sweet potatoes, and onion on the prepared pan with 1 tablespoon oil, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper; spread into a single layer.
3. Sprinkle chicken with remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and nestle it, skin-side up, in between the veggies on the baking sheet. Brush remaining oil on skin.
4. Roast in preheated oven 45 minutes or until chicken is cooked through, golden and crisp. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
5. While the sheet pan dinner is cooking, prepare vinaigrette. Whisk mustard, vinegar, maple syrup, salt, and cayenne together in a small bowl until well combined.
6. Drizzle sauce over veggies and chicken.
