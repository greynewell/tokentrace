## Ingredients

- 1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour, or as needed
- 2  eggs
- 1  egg yolk
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 2  lobster tails
- ¼ cup water
- ¾ cup butter, cut into pieces
- ½ cup cherry tomatoes, halved
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 10 leaves basil, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Pour flour onto a clean work surface and make a well in the middle.
2. Mix eggs, egg yolk, and 1/2 teaspoon salt together in a bowl.
3. Pour the egg mixture into the well; slowly incorporate flour into egg mixture until combined.
4. Knead dough until smooth and elastic, 8 to 10 minutes, adding more flour as needed.
5. Cover and let rest for at least 30 minutes.
6. Roll dough using a pasta machine or rolling pin; cut into noodles about 1/4-inch wide.
7. Bring a large pot of water to a boil; add 1 tablespoon salt.
8. Prepare a large bowl of ice water.
9. Add lobster tails to the boiling water.
10. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes; drain and shock in the ice water.
11. Slit the shells with kitchen shears and gently extract the meat.
12. Heat 1/4 cup water in a saucepan over medium heat to just under a boil.
13. Add butter, piece by piece, using a kitchen thermometer to keep the sauce at 160 to 180 degrees F (71 to 82 degrees C).
14. Add lobster tails; cook until meat is opaque yet soft and almost undercooked, 5 to 6 minutes.
15. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
16. Reduce heat to low.
17. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
18. Cook noodles in the boiling water until tender yet firm to the bite, 1 to 3 minutes; drain.
19. Divide pasta and lobster equally among serving plates.
20. Add tomatoes to the butter sauce; cook until barely softened, about 2 minutes.
21. Split the sauce and tomatoes equally over the pasta and lobster.
22. Season with salt and pepper; garnish with basil leaves.
