## Ingredients

- 24 (1 ounce) sticks string cheese
- 5  eggs, beaten
- 3 cups Italian seasoned bread crumbs
- 1 quart vegetable oil for frying, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Remove string cheese sticks from plastic wrappings and cut the strings in half crosswise.
2. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place eggs in a bowl and bread crumbs into a large shallow bowl.
3. Dip cheese stick halves into egg and roll in bread crumbs to completely coat the sticks; place breaded cheese sticks onto the prepared baking sheet. Allow cheese sticks to stand at room temperature for about 5 minutes to set, and repeat dipping in egg and bread crumbs to form a thick coating. Freeze breaded cheese sticks for at least 2 hours.
4. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
5. Deep fry cheese sticks, a few at a time, until the coating is golden brown and crisp and the cheese is soft, 5 to 8 minutes. Let sticks drain on paper towels; cool slightly and serve warm.
