## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 ¼ teaspoons baking powder
- ⅛ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup white sugar
- ½ cup unsalted butter, softened
- 2  eggs
- ⅔ cup milk
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 2 teaspoons orange extract
- ½ cup unsalted butter, softened
- 3 cups powdered sugar
- 3 tablespoons heavy cream
- 1 teaspoon orange extract
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1  orange, peeled and sliced
- ½ cup orange juice
- 2 teaspoons cornstarch
- 2 tablespoons powdered sugar

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 12-cup muffin pan with paper liners or grease with butter.
2. Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl.
3. Beat sugar and butter together in a separate bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs, one at a time, then add milk, vanilla extract, and orange extract slowly.
4. Pour batter evenly into the prepared tin.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool completely.
6. Beat butter for frosting with a mixer on high speed; mix in powdered sugar. Add heavy cream 1 tablespoon at a time. Add orange extract and vanilla extract and mix until smooth. Frost cooled cupcakes.
7. Combine orange, orange juice, cornstarch, and powdered sugar for glaze in a saucepan. Stir until all lumps are gone. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and let simmer, stirring every few seconds, for 5 minutes. Strain orange out of the glaze into a container. Pour a little glaze over each frosted cupcake.
