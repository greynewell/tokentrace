## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, or as needed
- 10  white mushrooms, minced
- 1  shallot, minced
- ½ teaspoon dried thyme
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon dried sage
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ cup chopped fresh parsley
- 2 cups fresh spinach
- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- 1 (2 pound) pork tenderloin, butterflied and pounded flat
- 4 slices prosciutto
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir mushrooms, shallot, thyme, garlic powder, sage, black pepper, and salt in the hot oil until liquid has evaporated and mushrooms and shallots are softened, 5 to 10 minutes.
3. Add parsley; cook and stir for 1 minute. Mix in spinach; cook and stir until spinach is wilted, about 5 minutes. Stir in mustard. Remove from heat.
4. Place pork tenderloin on a work surface; lay prosciutto atop tenderloin. Spread mushroom-spinach mixture over prosciutto, leaving a 1/2-inch border on all sides. Tightly roll tenderloin around filling and tie together with kitchen string to keep closed.
5. Heat remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; place rolled tenderloin in the hot oil. Sear until all sides are golden brown, about 10 minutes. Transfer seared tenderloin to a 9x13-inch casserole dish.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until pork is slightly pink in the center, 25 to 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
