## Ingredients

- ½ pound poppy seeds
- ¾ cup white sugar
- 1 tablespoon butter, melted
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice
- ½ cup hot milk
- 1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
- ½ cup warm water (100 degrees F/38 degrees C)
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 2 cups all-purpose flour, or more if needed
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ cup butter
- 1  egg, separated - white reserved

## Instructions

1. Make the filling: Place poppy seeds into a food processor; process until seeds are ground, about 1 minute.
2. Mix poppy seeds, 3/4 cup sugar, hot milk, 1 tablespoon melted butter, and lemon juice together in a bowl until combined; cover and refrigerate while making bread. The filling will set up and thicken as it chills.
3. Make the bread: Pour warm water into a small bowl; add sugar and sprinkle yeast on top. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.
4. Whisk flour and salt together in a bowl. Cut in butter with 2 knives or a pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add yeast mixture and egg yolk; stir to make a soft dough.
5. Turn dough out onto a floured work surface and knead until smooth and slightly springy, about 5 minutes. If dough is too sticky, knead in more flour, about 2 tablespoons at a time. Cut dough into 2 equal pieces. Roll each piece out into a 12x16-inch rectangle.
6. Spread half of the poppy seed filling over each rectangle, leaving a 1-inch border. Fold the 1-inch border back over the filling on all sides and press down. Pick up the shorter side of a dough rectangle and roll it like a jelly roll; repeat with second rectangle. Pinch ends together or tuck ends under to prevent filling from leaking out.
7. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper; place filled loaves seam-side down on the baking sheet and allow to rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.
8. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Beat egg white in a bowl until frothy; brush loaves with beaten egg white.
9. Bake in preheated oven until dark golden brown on top, 30 to 40 minutes. Remove loaves from the oven and cover with a clean kitchen towel until cool to keep crust soft. Cool completely before slicing.
