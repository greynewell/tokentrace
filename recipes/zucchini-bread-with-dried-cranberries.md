## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ cups whole wheat flour
- 2 tablespoons ground flax seed
- 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon baking soda

- ½ cup vegetable oil
- ¼ cup shredded carrots

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9x5 inch loaf pans. Whisk together the all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, flax seed, cinnamon, salt, baking powder, and baking soda in a bowl until evenly combined; set aside.
