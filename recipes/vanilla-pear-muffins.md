- ½ cup all-purpose flour
- ¾ cup white sugar
- 1 ½ teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ cup low-fat vanilla yogurt
- ½ cup canola oil
- 1  egg
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1  ripe pear - peeled, cored, and diced
- ½ cup chopped pecans

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease or line 12 muffin cups with paper liners.
2. Whisk whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Whisk yogurt, oil, egg, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl until smooth. Stir yogurt mixture into flour mixture until batter is just mixed; fold in pear and pecans. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups.
