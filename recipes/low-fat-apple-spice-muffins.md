## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 1 cup whole wheat pastry flour
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- 1 pinch salt
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ¼ teaspoon ground allspice
- ¼ teaspoon ground ginger
- 2  large egg whites
- ⅔ cup skim milk
- ⅔ cup nonfat plain yogurt
- 1 cup raw sugar
- 1 tablespoon canola oil
- ¼ teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 cup chopped peeled apple

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray 12 muffin cups with cooking spray.
2. Whisk the whole wheat pastry flour, all-purpose flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and ginger together in a large bowl until evenly combined. Use your fingers to make a well in the center of the dry ingredients.
3. In a separate bowl, whisk the egg whites, skim milk, yogurt, raw sugar, canola oil, and vanilla extract until smooth; mix in the chopped apple.
4. Pour the liquid ingredients into the well in the dry ingredients, and mix to make a thick batter.
5. Pour the batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling them about 2/3 full.
6. Bake the muffins in the preheated oven until lightly golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes.
7. Cool the muffins in their cups for about 5 minutes before removing to finish cooling on wire racks.
