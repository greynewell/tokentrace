## Ingredients

- 1 (1 pound) loaf frozen bread dough
- 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
- ½ tablespoon dried basil leaves
- ½ tablespoon dried minced onion flakes
- ½ tablespoon dried oregano
- 1 (8 ounce) package sliced pepperoni sausage
- 1 (6 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese
- 1  egg, lightly beaten

## Instructions

1. Allow frozen bread dough to thaw in the refrigerator, 8 hours to overnight. Place dough in a large, lightly greased bowl. Cover the bowl with a dish towel and place in a warm space until doubled in size, 2 to 3 hours. Punch down dough.
2. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a large baking sheet.
3. Roll dough into a 12x18-inch rectangle on the prepared baking sheet. Brush dough lightly with olive oil. Sprinkle with basil, onion flakes, and oregano. Layer with pepperoni to within 1/2 inch of the edges. Top with mozzarella cheese.
4. Beginning with the longest edge, roll dough into a thin cylinder and seal the seam. Brush with beaten egg.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 35 minutes. Cut into bite-sized pieces to serve.
