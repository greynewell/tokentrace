## Ingredients

- 1 (21 ounce) can apple pie filling
- ½ cup cinnamon sugar
- 15 (6 inch) flour tortillas
- oil for frying

1. Heat apple pie filling in a small pot over medium-low heat until warmed through, about 5 minutes.
2. Place cinnamon sugar in a shallow dish.
3. Spoon 1 1/2 tablespoons of filling onto each tortilla. Fold in opposing edges and roll up as you would a burrito.
4. Heat oil in a large, deep saucepan over medium heat.
