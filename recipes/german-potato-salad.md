## Ingredients

- 4  potatoes
- 4 slices bacon
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- ⅓ cup water
- ¼ cup white wine vinegar
- ½ cup chopped green onions
- salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes; cook until fork-tender, 8 to 15 minutes. Drain.
2. While the potatoes are cooking, cook bacon in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat until browned and crispy, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove bacon to a paper-towel lined plate, leaving the fat in the skillet. Chop or crumble bacon when cool enough to handle.
3. Add sugar and flour to the bacon fat, then pour in water and vinegar. Cook over medium heat, stirring any browned bits off the bottom with a wooden spoon, until dressing is thick, 3 to 5 minutes. Turn off the heat.
4. Add potatoes, bacon, and green onions to the skillet and stir until coated. Season with salt and pepper.
