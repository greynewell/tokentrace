## Ingredients

- 6  chicken thighs
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 pinches cayenne pepper, divided, or to taste
- 2 pinches garlic powder, divided, or to taste
- 1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 3 large eggs
- 2 cups panko bread crumbs

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking pan with parchment paper.
2. Combine flour, 1 pinch cayenne, 1 pinch garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a shallow bowl. Beat eggs in a second bowl. Combine panko bread crumbs with remaining 1 pinch cayenne, remaining 1 pinch garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a third bowl.
3. Dredge chicken thighs in flour mixture; shake off excess. Dip into beaten egg then press into panko mixture to coat both sides. Transfer breaded chicken thighs to the prepared pan.
