## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ⅔ cup shortening, chilled
- 6 tablespoons cold water
- 1 cup fresh strawberries, halved
- 2 cups fresh raspberries
- 1 ½ cups fresh blueberries
- ½ cup white sugar
- 3 tablespoons cornstarch

## Instructions

1. Make the crust: Combine flour and salt in a large bowl. Cut in cold shortening with 2 knives or a pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing with a fork, until flour mixture is moistened. Do not add more water than you need: when you squeeze a handful of the moistened pastry mixture, it should form a ball. Divide the dough in half and shape into balls. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
2. Transfer one dough ball to a lightly floured surface. Roll dough from the center to the edges to form a 12-inch circle. Wrap crust around the rolling pin. Unroll it onto a 9-inch pie plate. Ease crust into the pie plate, being careful not to stretch it. Trim the bottom crust evenly with the rim of the pie plate, and return the pastry-lined pie plate to the refrigerator.
3. Make the filling: Mix sugar and cornstarch together in a large bowl. Add raspberries, blueberries, and strawberries; gently toss to coat. Allow fruit mixture to stand for about 15 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place a baking sheet in the oven to preheat.
5. Roll out remaining dough for top crust. Stir berry mixture and pour into the pastry-lined pie plate. Place top crust over filling and trim the edges, leaving a 1/2-inch overhang. Fold top crust under bottom crust, pressing lightly to seal. Crimp the edges and cut vents in the top to allow steam to escape. To prevent over-browning, cover the edges with foil.
6. Bake in the preheated oven on the baking tray for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and continue to bake until crust is golden and filling is bubbling, about 20 minutes more.
