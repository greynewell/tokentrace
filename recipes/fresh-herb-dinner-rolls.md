## Ingredients

- 1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
- 1 cup milk, room temperature
- 2  eggs
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 2 tablespoons butter, softened
- ¼ cup chopped fresh parsley
- ¼ cup chopped fresh chives
- 6 cups bread flour
- 1  egg white
- 2 tablespoons water

## Instructions

1. In a small mixing bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in 1 cup warm water.
2. Let stand until creamy; about 10 minutes.
3. In a large bowl, stir together the yeast mixture with milk, eggs, salt, butter, parsley, chives, and 4 cups flour.
4. Add the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until dough has pulled together.
5. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.
6. Lightly oil a large bowl, place the dough in the bowl, and turn to coat with oil.
7. Cover with a damp cloth and put in a warm place to rise until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
8. Grease two 9x13 inch baking pans.
9. Deflate the dough, and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface.
10. Divide the dough into 24 pieces.
11. Shape each piece into a round ball, and place into the prepared pans.
12. Cover the rolls with a warm, damp cloth, and let rise until doubled in volume, about 40 minutes.
13. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
14. In a small bowl, lightly beat the egg white with 2 tablespoons of water; brush egg wash over tops of rolls.
15. Bake in preheated oven for about 30 minutes, or until golden brown.
