## Ingredients

- 4 cups water
- 2 tablespoons concentrated liquid shrimp and crab boil (such as Zatarain's®)
- 2 tablespoons seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®)
- 2 pounds live crawfish, rinsed
- 1 pound bite-sized red potatoes (such as Ruby Sensations®)
- 3 ears corn, shucked and cut into thirds, or more to taste
- 1 (12 ounce) package andouille sausage, sliced
- 1 tablespoon seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®)
- 2 cups water

## Instructions

1. Combine water, dry crab boil, and seafood seasoning in a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®). Add live crawfish. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 0 (zero) minutes. Allow 15 minutes for pressure to build (as the pressure builds it will steam the crawfish.)
2. Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 2 minutes. Carefully pour crawfish and the liquid into a large bowl and let sit for 30 minutes to soak while you prepare the rest of the meal.
3. Add potatoes, corn, andouille sausage, and 1 tablespoon seafood seasoning to the pot. Pour in water and stir until evenly combined. Close and lock the lid.
4. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 5 minutes. Allow 15 minutes for pressure to build.
5. Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 2 minutes. Divide the mixture between 4 plates and serve with crawfish.
