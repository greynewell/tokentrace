## Ingredients

- 1 pound bulk sage-flavored pork sausage
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, at room temperature
- 1 cup shredded Parmesan cheese
- 1 tablespoon bacon bits, or to taste
- 1 clove garlic, minced, or to taste
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 4 large bell peppers - halved, seeded, and stems removed
- 2 tablespoons shredded Cheddar cheese, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a square baking pan with aluminum foil.
2. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease.
3. Combine cream cheese, Parmesan cheese, bacon bits, and garlic in a bowl. Stir in cooked sausage and season with salt and pepper. Mix with your hands until all ingredients are well combined.
4. Scoop sausage mixture into the pepper halves; press lightly to pack. Don't overstuff or understuff. Place in the prepared pan.
5. Bake until stuffing has hardened slightly on the top, 18 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and immediately sprinkle with Cheddar cheese.
6. Let sit for 5 minutes before removing from the pan.
