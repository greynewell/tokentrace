## Ingredients

- 8 cups fresh loquats
- lemon, juiced
- 1 cup sugar
- ¼ cup cornstarch
- cooking spray
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 cup packed light brown sugar
- ¼ teaspoon vanilla extract
- ¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ⅛ teaspoon salt
- 7 tablespoons cold butter, cut into small pieces

## Instructions

1. Remove seeds and blossoms from loquats, cut in half, and place into a saucepan. Drizzle with lemon juice immediately to prevent fruit from turning brown. Cover skillet and heat over low-medium heat until loquats release their juices and come to a simmer, 12 to 15 minutes. Stir often.
2. Whisk together sugar and cornstarch in a bowl and pour over the simmering loquats. Stir well until thoroughly combined and return to a simmer over low heat. Cook until filling has thickened, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool.
3. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
4. Heat a 9-inch cast-iron skillet in the for 5 minutes. Remove from oven and lightly coat with cooking spray. Transfer loquat filling to the skillet.
5. Lightly spoon flour into a dry measuring cup and level with a knife. Combine flour, brown sugar, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and salt in a bowl; cut in butter with a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse meal. Sprinkle mixture over loquat filling.
6. Place skillet on a sheet pan and bake in the preheated oven until filling is thick and bubbly and topping is browned, about 25 minutes. Remove from oven; let stand 20 minutes. Serve warm.
