## Ingredients

- 2 (2 to 3 pound) whole chickens, cut into pieces
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 5 tablespoons seasoned salt
- 3 tablespoons garlic powder
- salt and pepper to taste
- 4  eggs, beaten
- 1 quart vegetable oil for frying

## Instructions

1. Mix flour, seasoned salt, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a shallow plate or bowl. Place eggs in a separate shallow bowl.
2. Roll or shake chicken pieces in the flour mixture and place on a platter. Then dip each chicken piece in the egg and roll again in the flour mixture.
3. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
4. Fry coated chicken pieces in hot oil for about 5 minutes on each side. Cover skillet and cook on lower heat for about 10 minutes. Remove cover, turn up the heat, and fry for 5 minutes on each side to make chicken crispy. Chicken is done when it is no longer pink inside and its juices run clear. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
5. Drain fried chicken on paper towels and keep warm in an oven until ready to serve.
