## Ingredients

- 4 large unpeeled russet potatoes, cut into 1/4-inch strips
- ¼ cup olive oil
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- ½ teaspoon ground dried thyme
- ¼ teaspoon seasoned salt  (Optional)
- ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided
- ¼ cup chopped fresh parsley
- ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- ¼ teaspoon seasoned salt  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Place the potatoes in a mixing bowl and drizzle with olive oil. Season with garlic, thyme, and 1/4 teaspoon seasoned salt. Toss until evenly coated. Lift the fries out of the bowl and spread onto a nonstick baking sheet in a single layer. Save the remaining oil in the bowl.
3. Bake in the preheated oven 30 minutes, flipping the fries halfway through baking. Return the fries to the bowl with the olive oil, sprinkle with 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese and parsley. Toss to coat, then spread again onto the baking sheet. Return to the oven, and bake until the Parmesan cheese melts, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle the fries with the remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese and 1/4 teaspoon seasoned salt to serve.
