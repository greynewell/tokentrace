## Ingredients

- 2 (13 ounce) packages smoked kielbasa sausage, cut into bite-size pieces
- 1 medium onion, thinly sliced
- 1 (32 ounce) package sauerkraut, drained
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 tablespoon butter, melted
- ½ teaspoon black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon caraway seeds

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lay a large sheet of Reynolds Wrap® Heavy Duty Aluminum Foil on a baking sheet. In the center of the foil, combine the sausage, onion, sauerkraut, oil, butter, pepper and caraway seeds; mix well. Bring up foil sides. Double fold top and ends to make a packet, leaving room for heat circulation inside. Place the foil package in preheated oven and roast for 30 minutes.
