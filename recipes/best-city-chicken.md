## Ingredients

- 2 pounds boneless pork, cut into 1 1/2-inch cubes
- 14 (4 inch) skewers
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- seasoned salt (such as LAWRY'S®) to taste
- 4  eggs
- 3 tablespoons milk
- 2 cups Italian seasoned bread crumbs
- 2 cups water
- 2 cups vegetable oil for frying

## Instructions

1. Thread 2 or 3 cubes of pork onto each skewer. Sprinkle pork on all sides with salt, pepper, and seasoned salt; set the skewers aside.
2. Whisk eggs and milk together in a bowl. Place bread crumbs in a separate bowl. Pour 2 cups of water into a 9x13-inch baking dish with a wire rack set in the dish; set the dish aside.
3. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
4. Dip each pork skewer into egg mixture, then press into bread crumbs to coat; dip pork skewers a second time into egg mixture and then crumbs.
5. Lower pork skewers carefully into the hot oil in batches. Fry until crisp and golden, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Repeat with remaining pork skewers. Arrange fried pork skewers on the wire rack in the baking dish. Cover the dish tightly with aluminum foil.
6. Carefully transfer the baking dish into the preheated oven and bake for 20 minutes. Remove foil and bake 10 minutes more to dry out the crumb coating.
