## Ingredients

- ½ (8 ounce) package elbow macaroni
- 1 ½ cups water
- 1 large egg
- ⅓ cup diced red bell pepper
- ⅓ cup cubed pepper Jack cheese
- ¼ cup diced jalapeno pepper, or to taste
- ¼ cup sliced celery
- 2 tablespoons diced onion
- ½ cup mayonnaise
- ½ tablespoon apple cider vinegar
- 2 teaspoons chile-garlic sauce (such as Sriracha®)
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon garlic powder
- ⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- freshly ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Place macaroni into the bottom of a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and pour in water. Add a trivet on top of that, so that it sits above the the water, and place the egg on it. Close and lock the lid; turn the valve to Sealing. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 5 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
2. Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Remove the egg and place into a bowl of ice water for 5 minutes; remove the trivet.
3. Leave the macaroni in the liner, but remove it from the Instant Pot® to avoid additional residual cooking. Add several ice cubes and cold water to the liner, stirring macaroni, which will stop the cooking process.
4. Pour macaroni into a colander; drain very well to avoid a watery macaroni salad. Dry out the inside of the liner and return the macaroni to the liner.
5. Peel the egg and dice. Add egg, red bell pepper, pepper Jack cheese, jalapeno, celery, and onion to the pot and stir.
6. Whisk mayonnaise, vinegar, Sriracha, salt, garlic powder, cayenne, and black pepper together in a small bowl. Add dressing to the macaroni mixture, stir until well incorporated. Transfer the salad to a bowl and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, allowing time for the flavors to meld.
