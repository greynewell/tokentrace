## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon oil, or as needed
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 2 pounds ground beef
- 1 cup water, or as needed
- ground black pepper to taste
- 6 tablespoons soy sauce, divided
- 2 medium red potatoes
- 10  baby carrots, or more to taste, cubed
- ½ cup raisins, or more to taste
- 2 (6.5 ounce) cans tomato sauce with salt (such as Contadina®)
- ½  orange bell pepper, diced
- 4 tablespoons white sugar

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic and cook until light golden brown, about 1 minute. Add beef and 1/2 cup water; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Season with black pepper and add more water as needed; do not let beef dry out.
2. Add 3 tablespoons soy sauce, potatoes, and carrots to the saucepan with the beef. Add more water as needed to prevent drying out. Cook 4 minutes; add raisins. Cook 2 to 3 minutes more, adding water as needed to make sure beef does not dry out.
3. Add 1 can of sauce to the saucepan with the beef mixture. Fill that can with water, stir to remove excess sauce, and pour water into saucepan. Add 1/2 of the remaining can of sauce to the saucepan; stir to combine. Add more water as needed to create a sauce-like but not soupy consistency.
4. Add bell pepper, remaining 3 tablespoons soy sauce, and sugar. Cook until all vegetables are soft, about 3 to 5 minutes more, stirring occasionally and adding water as needed to be sure the sauce does not dry out.
