## Ingredients

- 3  eggs
- 1 cup vegetable oil
- 2 cups white sugar
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- 2 cups cantaloupe - peeled, seeded and pureed
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ¾ teaspoon baking powder
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon ground ginger
- ½ cup butter
- 1 ⅔ cups brown sugar
- ½ cup chopped pecans

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease and flour two 9x5-inch loaf pans.
2. Beat together sugar, puréed cantaloupe, oil, eggs, and vanilla in a large bowl until well combined. Sift together flour, cinnamon, baking soda, salt, baking powder, and ginger in a separate bowl. Stir flour mixture into cantaloupe mixture until combined. Divide batter evenly between the prepared pans.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the centers of loaves comes out clean, about 1 hour.
4. Meanwhile, make sauce: Combine brown sugar and butter in a microwave-safe bowl. Cook in the microwave for 3 minutes, stirring at 1-minute intervals. Mix in pecans.
