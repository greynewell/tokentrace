## Ingredients

- 1  butternut squash, halved lengthwise and seeded
- 1 (16 ounce) package rotini pasta
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon dry mustard
- 2 cups milk
- 6 ounces shredded white Cheddar cheese
- 6 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese
- ¼ cup seasoned dry bread crumbs, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Place squash, cut-side down, on a baking sheet.
3. Roast squash in the preheated oven until soft, 40 to 50 minutes. Remove squash flesh from skin and set aside. Reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
4. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook rotini in boiling water until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain.
5. Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Whisk flour and mustard into melted butter until smooth, about 1 minute. Gradually whisk milk into flour mixture until thick like heavy cream, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat.
6. Stir squash, white Cheddar cheese, and Cheddar cheese into milk mixture until cheese is melted. Stir rotini into cheese mixture. Pour cheese mixture into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Top with bread crumbs.
7. Bake in the preheated oven until topping is golden, about 10 minutes.
