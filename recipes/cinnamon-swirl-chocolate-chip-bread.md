## Ingredients

- 2 cups gluten-free all-purpose flour blend
- 2 teaspoons gluten-free baking powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ cup white sugar
- ½ cup brown sugar
- ⅓ cup vegetable oil
- 1 cup buttermilk
- 1  egg
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 cup chocolate chips

- 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
2. Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.
3. Combine sugar, brown sugar, and oil in a separate bowl. Stir in buttermilk, egg, and vanilla extract. Add to flour mixture and mix until combined. Fold in chocolate chips. Spoon 1/2 of the batter into the prepared loaf pan.
4. Combine brown sugar and cinnamon for the topping in a small bowl. Sprinkle all but 2 tablespoons topping into the loaf pan and cover with the remaining batter. Gently drag a knife through the batter to create a swirl. Sprinkle the remaining topping on top of the loaf.
