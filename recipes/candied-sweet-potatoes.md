## Ingredients

- 4 pounds sweet potatoes, quartered
- 1 ¼ cups margarine
- 1 ¼ cups brown sugar
- 3 cups miniature marshmallows, divided
- ground cinnamon to taste
- ground nutmeg to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
2. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add potatoes and boil until slightly underdone, about 15 minutes; drain and peel when cool enough to handle.
3. While potatoes are cooling, combine 2 cups marshmallows, margarine, brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a large saucepan over medium heat; cook, stirring occasionally, until marshmallows are melted.
4. Stir potatoes into marshmallow sauce, mashing about half of the potatoes and breaking the other half into bite-sized chunks. Transfer into the prepared baking dish.
5. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Sprinkle remaining 1 cup marshmallows evenly over top and continue to bake until marshmallows are slightly toasted and golden brown, about 5 minutes.
