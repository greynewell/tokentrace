## Ingredients

- 1 (8 ounce) container extra-firm tofu
- ¼ cup cornstarch
- ¼ cup unsweetened soy milk
- ¼ cup quinoa flakes
- ¼ cup nutritional yeast
- 1 tablespoon minced fresh oregano
- 1 tablespoon minced flat-leaf parsley
- 1 tablespoon minced fresh sage leaves
- 2 tablespoons minced fresh rosemary
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

## Instructions

1. Squeeze the liquid from the block of tofu by wrapping it in a clean towel and pressing it with a weight.
2. Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
3. Set up a breading station with 3 shallow bowls, not too wide, and one flat plate. Put the cornstarch in one, and unsweetened soy milk in another. In the last one, add the quinoa flakes, nutritional yeast, oregano, sage, rosemary, and pepper. Mix with a fork. Leave the plate for the finished tofu.
4. Slice the slab of tofu into pieces that are approximately 1/2-inch thick and approximately 2 inches in length and width. They should be able to be handled easily without breaking.
5. Dredge each slice in cornstarch first. Dip each piece in the soy milk. Coat the slices with the quinoa flake mixture, tapping to shake off the excess. Place each coated tofu piece on the empty plate. Add as many pieces that will fit without touching into the air fryer basket.
6. Cook until browned and crispy, about 10 minutes. There is no need to flip the pieces and do not shake the basket. The coating is light and will come off easily if not cooked through. When the tofu pieces are browned and crispy, remove them and continue cooking the remaining pieces. Serve warm.
