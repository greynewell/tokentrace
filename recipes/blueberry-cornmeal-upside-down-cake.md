## Ingredients

- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ cups cornmeal
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 pound unsalted butter, softened
- 3 cups white sugar
- 8  eggs, at room temperature
- 1 ½ cups sour cream
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- ½ cup unsalted butter, divided
- 1 cup brown sugar, divided
- 6 cups fresh blueberries, divided

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Mix all-purpose flour, cornmeal, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl.
3. Cream together butter and sugar with an electric mixer until smooth. Beat in eggs one at a time, scraping down the bowl after each addition. Add sour cream and vanilla; combine until smooth. Add flour mixture and mix until incorporated. Set aside.
4. Divide butter between two 9-inch cast iron pans; melt over medium-low heat, about 1 minute. Add 1/2 of the brown sugar to each pan; cook until butter and sugar begin to bubble, 2 to 3 minutes. Divide blueberries between the two pans and remove from stove top.
5. Divide cornmeal batter between the pans; place each on a sheet pan.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes.
7. Let cool slightly, about 15 minutes. Run a knife around the outer edges of each cake and invert onto a cutting board for slicing.
