## Ingredients

- ¼ cup water
- 2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
- 8 cups all-purpose flour
- 8  eggs
- ¾ cup butter, melted
- ½ cup white sugar
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 2  lemons, zested
- 6 cups vegetable oil for frying

## Instructions

1. Mix water and yeast together in a small bowl. Let stand until foamy, about 15 minutes.
2. Combine flour, eggs, butter, 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar, and lemon zest in a large bowl; add yeast mixture. Knead by hand until dough comes together. Cover with a clean dish towel. Let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 2 hours.
3. Roll out dough into a large rectangle on a lightly floured work surface. Cut into diamond shapes using a small pastry wheel cutter. Brush off excess flour.
