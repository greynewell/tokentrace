## Ingredients

- 1 (6 ounce) salmon fillet, frozen
- 1 teaspoon sea salt
- ground black pepper to taste
- 1 dash liquid smoke flavoring
- 2 tablespoons butter, divided

## Instructions

1. Thaw the salmon slightly in cold water, and remove the skin. Use a very sharp knife to slice the fillet into thin slices. Place the slices in a bowl, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Toss with enough liquid smoke to coat the fish, and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
2. Heat the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry the salmon slices for a few minutes turning once. Fish should flake easily with a fork when done.
