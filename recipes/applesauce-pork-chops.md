## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon butter
- ¼ cup chopped onion
- 1  apple - peeled, cored, and sliced
- 2  (1/2-inch thick) pork chops
- ¾ cup applesauce
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- ½ teaspoon ground mustard
- ⅛ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir apple and onion in melted butter until tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer apple and onion mixture to a bowl.
3. Place pork chops in the same skillet over medium heat; cook until pork chops are browned, about 5 minutes per side. Place pork chops in a 9x9-inch baking dish; season with salt and black pepper.
4. Mix applesauce, brown sugar, mustard, and cinnamon into apple and onion mixture. Spoon over pork chops.
5. Bake, covered, in the preheated oven until pork chops are no longer pink in the center, 30 to 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
