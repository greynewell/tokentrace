## Ingredients

- 4  boneless, center-cut pork chops, 1-inch thick
- 1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning
- 1 ½ cups cheese and garlic flavored croutons
- 2  eggs
- cooking spray

## Instructions

1. Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Place pork chops on a plate and season both sides with Cajun seasoning.
3. Pulse croutons in a small food processor until fine; transfer to a shallow dish. Lightly beat eggs in a separate shallow dish. Working one at a time, dip pork chops into beaten egg, letting excess drip off; press into crouton breading to coat both sides and place breaded chop, unstacked, onto a plate. Repeat with remaining chops. Mist chops with cooking spray.
4. Spray the air fryer basket with cooking spray and arrange chops in a single layer in the air fryer basket. You may have to do two batches depending on the size of your air fryer.
5. Cook in the preheated air fryer for 5 minutes; flip chops and mist again with cooking spray if there are dry areas. Cook 5 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the chops should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
