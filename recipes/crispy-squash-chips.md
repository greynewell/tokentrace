## Ingredients

- 2 small acorn squash, or more to taste
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- ½ teaspoon Sea Salt, gray
- 1 pinch ground cumin
- 1 pinch ground cinnamon

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Use a vegetable peeler to peel squash skin as thinly as possible. Chop peels into 1-inch square pieces; you should have about 1 cup squash peels. Reserve squash flesh for another use.
3. Mix olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon sea salt, cumin, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Add squash peels and stir until evenly coated. Spread peels onto 2 baking sheets.
4. Roast in the preheated oven until crispy and golden brown, 13 to 15 minutes; watch closely as thinner chips can burn quickly.
5. Season roasted chips with salt as needed.
