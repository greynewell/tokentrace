## Ingredients

- 5 quarts water, or as needed
- 1  turkey carcass
- 1 ½ cups coarsely chopped onion
- 3 stalks celery
- ½ cup chopped carrot
- 10  whole black peppercorns
- 1 pinch dried thyme, or to taste
- 1  bay leaf
- 1 ½ pounds carrots, cut into 1-inch chunks
- 2  onions, diced
- 6 stalks celery, cut into 1/2-inch slices
- 1 cup barley
- ½ cup chopped mushrooms
- 2  bay leaves
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1 teaspoon dried marjoram
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 pinch dried thyme

## Instructions

1. Make turkey stock: Combine 5 quarts water and turkey carcass in a large stockpot over medium-high heat; bring to a boil. Add onion, carrot, celery, peppercorns, bay leaf, and thyme. Reduce heat and simmer, skimming excess fat and foam from the surface as needed and adding more water as it evaporates, for 2 to 2 1/2 hours.
2. Remove carcass to a cutting board and cool. Strain stock; discard solids and return liquid to the pot.
3. Pull meat from cooled carcass and discard bones. Shred meat and refrigerate until needed.
4. Make soup: Add carrots, onions, celery, barley, mushrooms, bay leaves, salt, marjoram, pepper, and thyme to stock; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until barley is fully cooked, about 1 hour 20 minutes.
5. Return shredded turkey to the soup; simmer until heated through, about 10 minutes. Remove bay leaves and serve.
