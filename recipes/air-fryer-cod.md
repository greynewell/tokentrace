## Ingredients

- 1 large egg
- 1 pinch salt
- ¾ cup panko bread crumbs
- 2 tablespoons ranch seasoning mix
- 4 (4 ounce) frozen cod fillets
- nonstick cooking spray

## Instructions

1. Preheat the air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 5 minutes.
2. In a shallow dish, whip egg until lemon colored and frothy. Season with a pinch of salt. In another shallow dish combine panko bread crumbs and ranch seasoning. Dip cod fillets first in the egg mixture, then in the panko mixture.
3. Line an air fryer basket with a perforated parchment round. Carefully place cod into the basket and spray with nonstick spray.
