## Ingredients

- 1 ¼ cups semisweet chocolate chips, divided
- 2 tablespoons shortening, divided
- ¾ cup white sugar
- ½ cup unsalted butter, softened
- 1  egg
- 1 tablespoon milk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon instant espresso powder
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ½ cup finely chopped toasted walnuts
- ¾ cup cherry pie filling, including 36 cherries

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Place 1/2 cup chocolate chips and 1 tablespoon shortening in the top of a double boiler over simmering water. Stir frequently, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, until chocolate is melted, about 5 minutes. Set aside to cool.
3. Combine sugar and butter in a large bowl and beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until fluffy. Beat in cooled chocolate mixture. Add egg, milk, and vanilla extract; beat until well combined. Add flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, espresso powder, and salt; beat on low speed until just combined and a dough forms.
4. Shape dough into 3 dozen 1-inch balls and roll in chopped walnuts to coat. Place balls 1 inch apart on the prepared baking sheet. Make an indentation in the center of each cookie using your thumb.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are firm, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer cookies to a wire rack and let cool, about 30 minutes.
6. While cookies are cooling, place remaining 3/4 cup chocolate chips and 1 tablespoon shortening in the top of a double boiler over simmering water. Stir frequently, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, until chocolate is melted, about 5 minutes. Cool slightly.
7. Spoon a cherry with some of the sauce into the center of each cooled cookie and drizzle chocolate mixture over the tops. Let stand until chocolate is set.
