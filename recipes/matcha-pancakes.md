## Ingredients

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon green tea powder (matcha)
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup cashew milk
- 1 tablespoon cashew milk
- 1  egg
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- ¼ cup white chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. Whisk flour, matcha, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Make a well in the center of the mixture; add 1 cup plus 1 tablespoon cashew milk, egg, olive oil, and vanilla extract. Whisk batter briefly until just combined with some small clumps of flour remaining. Add chocolate chips; stir again briefly.
2. Grease a small saucepan lightly; heat over medium-low heat. Transfer 2 to 3 spoonfuls of batter onto the center of the pan, spreading batter with the back of the spoon. Cook until small bubbles start to rise to the surface and burst, about 1 minute. Flip and cook until edges are lightly golden brown, about 1 minute more.
