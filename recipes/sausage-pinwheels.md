## Ingredients

- 1 pound ground pork sausage
- 1  onion, finely chopped
- 2 stalks celery, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
- ground black pepper to taste
- ½ (17.5 ounce) package frozen puff pastry, thawed

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
2. In a medium bowl, mix together ground pork sausage, onion, celery, parsley and pepper.
