## Ingredients

- 4 (4 ounce) boneless pork chops
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 2 cups oil for frying, or as needed
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- 1  egg, beaten
- ¾ cup panko (Japanese-style bread crumbs)

## Instructions

1. Place the pork chops between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound the pork with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a 1/4-inch thickness (about .75 cm). Season with salt and pepper to taste.
2. Pour oil into a skillet about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) deep. Heat the oil over medium-high heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
3. Place the flour, egg, and panko crumbs in separate bowls. Coat each cutlet in flour, then egg, and finally in bread crumbs. Tap off any loose crumbs.
4. Fry the cutlets until golden brown and cooked through, about 4 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels.
