## Ingredients

- 2  red bell peppers, cut into chunks
- 2 cups heavy cream
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- ⅛ teaspoon ground white pepper
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper

## Instructions

1. Combine the bell peppers and heavy cream in a pot and bring to boil over medium heat; reduce heat to medium-low and continue simmering, stirring occasionally, until the cream reduces to about 1 cup, about 30 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in the paprika, lemon juice, salt, white pepper, and cayenne pepper.
2. Pour the sauce into a blender. Hold the lid firmly with a towel while blending, using a few quick pulses to get the sauce moving before leaving it on to blend until smooth. Serve hot.
