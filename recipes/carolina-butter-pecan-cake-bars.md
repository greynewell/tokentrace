## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 ½ cups pecan pieces
- 2 cups white sugar
- 1 cup butter
- 4  eggs
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon butter extract
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup milk
- 6 ½ cups confectioners' sugar
- 11 ounces cream cheese, softened
- ⅔ cup butter, softened
- 1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract
- ½ teaspoon almond extract
- 1 tablespoon milk, or more as needed

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan.
2. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a small, heavy skillet over medium heat. Add pecans and cook until toasted, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool.
3. Combine white sugar and 1 cup butter in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in 2 teaspoons vanilla extract and butter extract.
4. Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Add to creamed butter mixture alternately with milk, beating just until combined. Fold in pecans. Pour batter into the prepared pan.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes.
6. Beat confectioners' sugar, cream cheese, 2/3 cup butter, 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract, and almond extract in a large bowl until smooth. Beat in enough milk to give frosting a spreadable consistency.
7. Divide hot cake in half and chop 1 half into a large bowl. Stir in 1/4 of the frosting. Repeat with remaining half, stirring in an additional 1/4 of the frosting. Spread mixture back into the baking pan; press flat with your fingers. Spread remaining frosting over the pressed cake mixture.
8. Refrigerate until firm, 3 to 4 hours. Cut into bars.
