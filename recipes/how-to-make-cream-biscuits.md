## Ingredients

- 2 cups self-rising flour
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 1 ½ cups heavy whipping cream
- 2 tablespoons butter, melted, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Move an oven rack to the enter position of your oven; preheat oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
2. Combine self-rising flour and sugar in a mixing bowl; stir in cream until almost all the flour has been incorporated and dough is wet and sticky.
3. Turn dough onto a well-floured work surface and gently press it into a rectangle about 1/2-inch thick. Use a bench scraper to lift up ends of dough and fold dough into thirds. Press dough again into a thick rectangle.
4. Roll dough out into a 6x10-inch rectangle about 1/2-inch thick. Cut rounds from the dough using a 3-inch biscuit cutter. Gently press dough scraps together into a thick disk, roll out 1/2-inch thick, and cut 3 more biscuits. If any dough remains, lightly press it flat and cut one more biscuit from the remaining dough.
5. Arrange biscuits on prepared baking sheet. Brush tops of biscuits generously with melted butter.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until biscuits are golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Brush hot biscuits with melted butter again and let stand 2 to 3 minutes to cool slightly before serving.
