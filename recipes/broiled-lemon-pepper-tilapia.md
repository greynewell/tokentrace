## Ingredients

- 8 (4 ounce) tilapia fillets
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
- 2 teaspoons lemon-pepper seasoning
- ½ cup salted butter, melted
- ⅛ cup dry bread crumbs

## Instructions

1. Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a broiler pan with aluminum foil.
2. Place fillets on the prepared pan. Stir parsley and lemon-pepper seasoning into the melted butter in a small bowl. Baste fillets with the butter mixture using a turkey baster, using the entire mixture. Sprinkle fillets with bread crumbs.
3. Broil in the preheated oven until the thickest part of the fish flakes easily with a fork, 7 to 9 minutes.
4. Remove fish from the pan and place it on a platter. Remove the foil very carefully from the pan, taking care not to spill the excess butter sauce, and pour over the fish. Serve immediately.
