## Ingredients

- 6  pork chops
- salt and pepper to taste

- ½ cup all-purpose flour

- 2 cubes  chicken bouillon
- 2 cups boiling water
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 (8 ounce) container sour cream

## Instructions

1. Season pork chops with salt, pepper, and garlic powder, and then dredge in 1/2 cup flour. In a skillet over medium heat, lightly brown chops in a small amount of oil.
