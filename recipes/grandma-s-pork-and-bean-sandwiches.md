## Ingredients

- 4 slices white bread
- 4 slices processed cheese
- 6 slices bacon, cut in half
- 1 (15 ounce) can baked beans with pork

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven's broiler.
2. Place bread slices on a broiling pan that has been lined with aluminum foil.
3. Spoon about 1/2 cup of beans onto each piece of bread.
4. Cover each pile of beans with a slice of cheese.
5. Place three half-slices of bacon onto each sandwich so that they are not hanging over the edge.
6. Broil for 5 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the bacon is cooked and cheese is melted.
7. Watch them carefully! I suggest leaving the oven door cracked near the 5 minute mark to allow some of the oven heat to escape.
