## Ingredients

- 1 quart vegetable oil, or as needed
- 1 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour
- ¼ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon garlic powder, or more to taste
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper, or more to taste  (Optional)
- 1 ¼ cups flat beer
- 2  egg yolk, beaten

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
2. Heat 1 quart vegetable oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
3. Combine flour, Parmesan cheese, parsley, salt, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper in a large bowl.
4. Whisk beer, egg yolk, and 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a small bowl.
5. Pour beer mixture into flour mixture; stir to form a batter.
