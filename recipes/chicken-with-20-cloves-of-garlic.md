## Ingredients

- ⅔ cup olive oil
- ¼ cup red wine vinegar
- 20 cloves garlic
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 teaspoon dried rosemary
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- ½ teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 1  large whole chicken, cut into 6 serving pieces
- 1 teaspoon olive oil, or as needed
- 1 pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian parsley  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Pour olive oil into blender and add red wine vinegar, garlic, thyme, rosemary, oregano, and red pepper flakes. Blend until garlic marinade is smooth and creamy.
2. Cut several deep slashes into the meat of each chicken piece using a sharp knife. Place chicken into a large bowl, pour marinade over chicken, and stir to get marinade into the cuts and all over the chicken. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.
