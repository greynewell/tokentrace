## Ingredients

- 2 teaspoons vegetable oil
- 1 (12 ounce) package frozen hash brown potatoes
- 3 slices bacon
- ½ large red bell pepper, chopped
- 1 medium jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
- 4 large eggs, beaten
- 2 tablespoons shredded Cheddar cheese
- 2 tablespoons sour cream
- 1 teaspoon hot sauce

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add hash browns and cook, turning occasionally, until browned and heated through, about 15 minutes. Use a spatula to break up potatoes into smaller pieces. Remove from the skillet and set aside. Wipe out the skillet.
2. Place bacon in the skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels and crumble when cool enough to handle. Clean out the grease from the skillet.
3. Saute bell pepper in the skillet over medium-high heat until it starts to char, 5 to 7 minutes. Add jalapeno and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Add hash browns and cook until heated through, about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium, and add eggs and bacon; stir until eggs are cooked, about 3 minutes. Add Cheddar, sour cream, and hot sauce.
