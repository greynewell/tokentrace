## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- ½ teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 2 cups milk
- 2 tablespoons butter, melted
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2  eggs

## Instructions

1. Sift together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Stir in milk, butter, and vanilla. Add in eggs and mix until smooth.
2. Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crêpe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.
3. Cook the crêpe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook the other side.
4. Stack the finished crêpes by putting wax paper between each one. Keep covered with a dry cloth until ready to eat.
