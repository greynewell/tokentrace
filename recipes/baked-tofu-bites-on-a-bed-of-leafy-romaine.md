## Ingredients

- 1 (16 ounce) package extra-firm tofu, sliced 1/2 inch thick
- cooking spray
- ½ cup teriyaki sauce
- 1 tablespoon sesame seeds
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon hot sauce
- ½ teaspoon white sugar
- 1 small head romaine lettuce, or to taste, torn
- 3  strawberries, or more to taste, sliced
- ¼ cup raspberry vinaigrette dressing

## Instructions

1. Lay tofu slices onto several layers of paper towel; top with more paper towel. Place something heavy onto the tofu to squeeze excess water from the tofu; let sit until the tofu is drained, 20 to 30 minutes.
2. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Prepare a baking sheet with cooking spray.
3. Stir teriyaki sauce, sesame seeds, garlic, hot sauce, and sugar together in a bowl. Cut pressed tofu into 1/2-inch cubes and add to teriyaki sauce mixture; stir gently to coat. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and marinate 5 to 10 minutes.
4. Spread tofu onto prepared baking sheet and bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes, flip, and continue baking until golden brown, about 15 minutes more.
5. Prepare a bed of romaine lettuce on a salad platter. Arrange strawberry slices around the edge of the lettuce bed. Spritz or drizzle raspberry vinaigrette over the lettuce. Pile warm baked tofu onto the lettuce.
