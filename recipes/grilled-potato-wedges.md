## Ingredients

- ¼ cup olive oil
- 1 large clove garlic, peeled and crushed
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary, or more to taste
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme, or more to taste
- 4  Idaho potatoes, each cut into 8 wedges
- 1 teaspoon garlic salt
- freshly ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Combine olive oil, crushed garlic, chopped rosemary, and chopped thyme in a covered container; let stand for 2 hours or longer.
2. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
3. Put potatoes in a large saucepan and pour in enough salted water to cover; bring to a boil; cook over medium-high heat until mostly tender, 8 to 9 minutes. Drain potatoes and transfer to a bowl.
4. Remove garlic from the olive oil mixture and discard. Pour oil over potatoes, sprinkle with garlic salt and black pepper, and toss to coat.
5. Place potatoes skin-side down on the grill over direct heat; reserve remaining oil. Grill for 10 minutes; move potatoes to indirect heat until completely cooked, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a serving bowl and drizzle remaining oil over potatoes.
