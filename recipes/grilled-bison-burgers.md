## Ingredients

- 1 pound ground bison
- ½ cup panko bread crumbs
- 1  egg
- 3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
- 4 dashes hot sauce (such as Tabasco®)
- 1 pinch granulated garlic
- 1 pinch ground black pepper
- olive oil cooking spray
- 4 slices American cheese
- 4  hamburger buns, split and toasted

## Instructions

1. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.
2. Mix bison, bread crumbs, egg, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, garlic, and pepper together by hand in a large bowl; form into 4 patties. Place patties on a baking sheet. Cover with aluminum foil and refrigerate until chilled, about 15 minutes.
3. Spray patties with cooking spray and cook on the preheated grill until hot and slightly pink in the center, about 5 minutes per side. Top each patty with a slice of cheese; continue cooking until cheese melts, about 2 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C).
4. Sandwich patties between toasted bun halves.
