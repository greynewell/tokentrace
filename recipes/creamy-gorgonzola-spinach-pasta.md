## Ingredients

- 1 (16 ounce) package fusilli pasta
- 1 ½ tablespoons butter
- 2  shallots, minced
- 1 cup heavy whipping cream
- 4 cups fresh spinach
- ½ cup Gorgonzola cheese
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook fusilli in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.
