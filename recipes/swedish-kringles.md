## Ingredients

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- ½ cup butter
- 1 tablespoon water, or as needed
- 1 cup water
- ½ cup butter
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 3  eggs
- 1 teaspoon almond extract
- 1 cup confectioners' sugar
- 1 tablespoon heavy cream
- 1 tablespoon butter, softened
- 1 teaspoon almond extract

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. To make the dough cut 1/2 cup butter into 1 cup flour using a knife or pastry blender. Add water as needed and mix until crumbly, leaving pea-sized chunks. On a floured surface roll the dough out to 3 or 4 inches in width. Place on a rectangular cookie sheet.
3. In a small saucepan over high heat, bring 1 cup water and 1/2 cup butter to a boil. Remove from heat and stir in flour; mix until smooth. Beat in eggs one at a time, mixing well after each. Stir in 1 teaspoon almond extract. Spread filling over dough.
4. Bake in preheated oven for 55 to 60 minutes. The pastry will fall a little as it cools.
5. Meanwhile, combine confectioners' sugar, cream, 1 tablespoon butter and 1 teaspoon almond extract. Spread icing over pastry as soon as it's removed from the oven.
