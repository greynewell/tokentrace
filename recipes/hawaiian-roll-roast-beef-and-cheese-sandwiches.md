## Ingredients

- ½ cup prepared horseradish
- 1 (12 count) package Hawaiian bread rolls, split
- 12 slices deli roast beef
- 12 slices deli-sliced Swiss cheese
- ½ cup butter
- 1  onion, finely chopped
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon spicy brown mustard

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
