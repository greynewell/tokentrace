## Ingredients

- 3  eggs, beaten
- 1 cup raisins
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 cup butter, softened
- 1 cup brown sugar
- 1 cup white sugar
- 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 2 teaspoons baking soda
- 2 cups rolled oats

## Instructions

1. In a small bowl, combine the eggs, raisins, and vanilla. Cover and chill for 1 hour.
2. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
