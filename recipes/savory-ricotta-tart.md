## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
- ½ cup panko bread crumbs
- 1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
- 1 tablespoon finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
- 2  large eggs
- ¼ cup chopped fresh basil
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
- 1 pinch ground nutmeg
- 1 ½ cups ricotta cheese
- 1 ounce finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
- 2 tablespoons finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, or to taste
- 1 tablespoon olive oil, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Brush the bottom of a springform pan with 1 tablespoon olive oil.
2. Cook and stir bread crumbs and 1 tablespoon olive oil together in a skillet over medium heat until breadcrumbs are light golden, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir 1 tablespoon Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese into breadcrumbs; cook and stir until golden brown and toasted, about 1 minute more. Spread breadcrumbs out into the bottom of the prepared springform pan.
3. Beat eggs in a bowl with a whisk until pale yellow, thick, and frothy. Add basil, parsley, salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and nutmeg; stir to combine.
4. Whisk ricotta cheese and 1 ounce Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese into egg mixture. Drop cheese mixture by spoonfuls into the prepared springform pan and spread it evenly over breadcrumbs. Gently tap the pan against a work surface to settle the cheese layer. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil over the top.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until set, 20 to 25 minutes. Run a paring knife around the side to release tart from springform pan. Cool in the pan until cool enough to handle; remove springform pan ring.
6. Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with a wire rack.
7. Place tart on prepared baking sheet and bake in the preheated broiler until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes.
