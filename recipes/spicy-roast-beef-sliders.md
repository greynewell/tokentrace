## Ingredients

- ½ pound thinly sliced deli roast beef
- 1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed beef consomme, undiluted
- 1  jalapeno pepper, diced, or more to taste
- 1 dash Worcestershire sauce
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour, or as needed
- 12  Hawaiian bread rolls, split
- 6 slices provolone cheese
- 6 slices pepper Jack cheese
- 2 tablespoons spicy horseradish, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
2. Roughly chop roast beef until crumbly.
3. Combine consomme, jalapeno, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper in a saucepan over medium heat; bring to a simmer. Add roast beef, lower heat to medium-low, and simmer until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Add flour and stir constantly until thickened into a gravy, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.
4. Slice rolls in half without separating rolls from each other. Put bottom halves on a baking sheet and layer with provolone cheese slices. Spoon meat mixture on the provolone and cover with Cheddar cheese slices. Add a thin smear of horseradish and place top rolls on top.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes. Cut sliders apart to serve.
