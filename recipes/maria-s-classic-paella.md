## Ingredients

- 20  saffron threads, crushed
- ¾ cup olive oil
- 4  chicken thighs
- 1 cup chopped onion
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 4 links chorizo de bilbao (spicy Spanish semi-cured sausage)
- 2 cups Spanish paella rice
- 2 teaspoons Spanish sweet paprika
- ½ cup grated peeled roma (plum) tomatoes
- 8  clams in shell, scrubbed, or more to taste
- 8  mussels, cleaned and debearded, or more to taste
- 8  prawns, peeled and deveined (leave tails)

- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ½ cup chopped fresh Italian parsley
- 8 wedges lemon

## Instructions

1. Bring stock to a simmer in a stockpot over medium-low heat.
2. Stir crushed saffron into the simmering stock.
3. Heat olive oil in a paella pan over medium heat.
4. Fry chicken thighs in hot oil until lightly browned, 3 to 5 minutes per side.
5. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until the onion is translucent, 5 to 7 minutes more.
6. Arrange the chorizo into the pan around the chicken thighs and cook until warmed, 3 to 5 minutes per side.
7. Pour rice into the paella pan and stir to coat with oil; season with sweet paprika.
8. Stir grated tomato into the rice and cook until the tomato is warmed, 2 to 3 minutes.
9. Pour chicken stock into the paella pan and bring to a boil while scraping any browned bits of food off the bottom of the pan with a flat-edged wooden spoon.
10. Smooth surface of rice with the wooden spoon in an even layer so it cooks evenly.
11. Reduce heat to medium-low and continue to cook, without stirring, until the rice has softened but has yet to completely absorb the stock, 15 to 30 minutes.
12. Place clams and mussels, hinged-side down, into the rice; continue simmering until the mussels and clams open, 5 to 7 minutes.
13. Nestle prawns into the rice; add bell pepper and peas.
14. Continue cooking until the bottom of the rice is browned and fragrant, about 10 minutes.
15. Remove from heat and cool 5 to 10 minutes.
16. Season with salt and pepper, sprinkle parsley over the paella, and garnish with lemon wedges.
17. Serve with baguette slices.
