## Ingredients

- 24  baby red potatoes
- 2 quarts water, or amount to cover
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch
- 5 teaspoons kirsch liqueur
- 3 cups dry white wine
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 pound Emmentaler cheese, shredded
- 1 pound Gruyere cheese, shredded
- 1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 2 loaves baguette-style French bread, cut into cubes
- 1 (16 ounce) jar pickled pearl onions, drained
- 1 (12 ounce) jar pickled cornichons

## Instructions

1. Place potatoes into a large pot with enough water to cover; stir in salt.
2. Bring the water to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and cook until tender, about 20 minutes.
3. Drain potatoes, and set aside.
4. Stir the cornstarch and kirsch liqueur together in a small bowl until it forms a paste; set aside.
5. Combine the white wine and garlic in a large saucepan over medium heat; bring to a simmer.
6. Slowly whisk in the Emmentaler and Gruyere cheese, about 1/2 cup at a time, allowing each batch to melt before mixing in the next.
7. Stir in a random pattern to prevent cheese from clumping into a ball.
8. Whisk in cornstarch mixture and nutmeg to the cheese sauce; stir and cook at a simmer until thickened, 8 to 10 minutes.
9. Transfer the cheese mixture to a fondue pot.
10. Serve with the cooked red potatoes and French bread for dipping; garnish with pearl onions and cornichons.
