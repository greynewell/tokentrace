## Ingredients

- 8 slices pumpernickel bread
- 1 cup Thousand Island dressing
- ¾ pound deli sliced corned beef
- ½ pound sliced Swiss cheese
- 1 cup sauerkraut

## Instructions

1. Preheat a grill for low heat.
2. Cut 4 large squares of aluminum foil. Place 2 slices of bread side-by-side on each piece of foil. Spread the bread slices with Thousand Island dressing. Evenly divide the corned beef, Swiss cheese, and sauerkraut among the bread. Top with a second slice of bread to make a sandwich. Wrap the foil snugly around the sandwich to make a sealed packet.
3. Place the packets on the preheated grill. Cook, turning every 10 minutes, until the bread is lightly toasted and cheese melted, about 30 minutes.
