## Ingredients

- ¾ cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
- 3 tablespoons butter
- 1 tablespoon instant powdered milk
- ¼ cup white sugar
- ⅜ teaspoon salt
- 1  egg
- 1  egg white
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon active dry yeast
- ¾ cup dried currants
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1  egg yolk

- ½ cup confectioners' sugar

- 2 teaspoons milk

## Instructions

1. Put flour, warm water, 1/4 cup white sugar, egg, egg white, butter, yeast, milk powder, and salt in a bread maker and start on dough program.
2. When 5 minutes of kneading are left, add currants and cinnamon. Leave in the machine until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
3. Punch down dough on a floured surface, cover, and let rest for 10 minutes.
4. Shape into 12 balls and place in a greased 9x12-inch pan. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, 35 to 40 minutes.
5. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
6. Mix egg yolk with 2 tablespoons water in a small bowl; brush on dough.
7. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Remove from pan immediately and cool on wire rack.
8. Mix together confectioners' sugar, milk, and vanilla until smooth. Place glaze in a piping bag or a sandwich bag with the corner snipped off; pipe a cross onto each roll.
