## Ingredients

- 1 cup white sugar
- ½ cup shortening
- 2  eggs, room temperature
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 cup mashed fresh strawberries
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 2 cups confectioners' sugar
- ¼ cup butter, room temperature
- ¼ cup mashed fresh strawberries

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

3. Beat white sugar and shortening together until light and fluffy.
4. Beat eggs, one at a time, into sugar mixture until well mixed; stir in vanilla extract.
