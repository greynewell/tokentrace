## Ingredients

- ½ cup dry white wine (such as Sauvignon Blanc)
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 2 tablespoons heavy cream
- 2 teaspoons very finely minced shallots
- 4 ounces cold unsalted butter, cut into 1-inch cubes
- salt to taste
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Place wine, lemon juice, cream, and shallots in a saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium and let simmer until liquid is reduced by about 75%, 4 to 5 minutes.
2. Reduce heat to the lowest setting and whisk in 2 cubes butter. Keep butter moving until it completely melts. Add a few more cubes, whisking continuously so butter emulsifies into wine-lemon juice mixture. Continue to add remaining butter, a few cubes at a time, until sauce has a thick, luxurious texture, 4 to 6 minutes.
3. Remove the saucepan from heat. Season with cayenne pepper and salt.
