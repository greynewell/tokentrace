## Ingredients

- 1 pound spicy bulk pork sausage
- 1 (8 ounce) package reduced-fat cream cheese (Neufchatel), softened
- ¾ (16 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained
- 1 clove garlic, minced, or more to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

5. Unroll and separate crescent roll dough into individual portions.
6. Spread equal amounts of the sausage mixture into the middle of each dough portion.
