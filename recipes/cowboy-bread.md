## Ingredients

- ½ cup boiling water
- ¾ cup cold milk
- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- 1 ½ teaspoons active dry yeast
- 1  egg, beaten
- 2 tablespoons butter, melted and cooled
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 4 cups all-purpose flour

## Instructions

1. In a large bowl, stir together the water, milk, and sugar. Sprinkle the yeast over the top, and let stand for 5 minutes to dissolve.
2. Stir the egg and butter into the yeast mixture, then stir in the salt, nutmeg, and 2 cups of the flour. Mix until everything is well blended. Mix in remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time until the dough pulls away from the side of the bowl. Turn out onto a floured surface, and knead for 10 minutes (no cheating!). Place dough into a greased bowl, and let rise until doubled in size.
3. Divide the dough into 8 balls, and let rest for another 20 minutes. Roll each ball out to 8 to 10 inches in diameter.
4. Heat a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Fry each of the pieces of bread fro 30 to 60 seconds on each side, or until light to medium brown spots appear. Keep covered with a damp cloth, or store in a plastic bag until serving.
