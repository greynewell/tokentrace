## Ingredients

- 1 (3 pound) boneless beef chuck roast, cut into 1-inch cubes
- kosher salt to taste
- ground black pepper to taste
- ¼ teaspoon garlic powder, or to taste
- ⅓ cup all-purpose flour
- ½ cup vegetable oil
- 1 large green bell pepper, chopped
- 2  onions, chopped
- 1 cup diced celery
- 3 large cloves garlic, minced
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- 4 cups beef broth
- 3  bay leaves
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 2 tablespoons hot sauce
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- 2 (10 ounce) cans diced tomatoes with green chile peppers (such as RO*TEL®)
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ cup chopped fresh parsley leaves

## Instructions

1. Season beef cubes with kosher salt, black pepper, and garlic powder in a large bowl.
2. Dust beef with 1/3 cup flour and toss lightly to coat.
3. Heat vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot oil until evenly browned, 7 to 10 minutes.
4. Remove beef with slotted spoon; transfer to a bowl.
5. Stir bell pepper, onion, celery, and garlic into the oil left in the pot; cook and stir until vegetables are lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes.
6. Remove vegetables with a slotted spoon and add to the bowl of beef. Drain oil, reserving about 3 tablespoons in the pot. Reduce heat to low.
7. Gradually whisk 1/4 cup flour into the reserved oil until you achieve a dark golden-brown roux, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir constantly and watch carefully; roux burns easily.
8. Slowly pour beef broth into the roux while stirring; bring to a simmer, and cook until thickened, stirring constantly, about 3 minutes.
9. Return the beef and vegetables to the pot. Add bay leaves, thyme, hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce, basil, tomatoes with green chiles, and 1 teaspoon salt.
10. Bring to a boil over medium heat, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until beef is tender, about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally. Remove bay leaves and stir in chopped parsley to serve.
