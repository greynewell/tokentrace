## Ingredients

- 4 cups sweet potato, cubed
- ½ cup white sugar
- 2  eggs, beaten
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 4 tablespoons butter, softened
- ½ cup milk
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- ½ cup packed brown sugar
- ⅓ cup all-purpose flour
- 3 tablespoons butter, softened
- ½ cup chopped pecans

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
2. Prepare sweet potatoes: Put sweet potatoes in a medium saucepan and cover with water. Cook over medium-high heat until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large bowl.
