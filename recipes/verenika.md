## Ingredients

- 2 ½ cups dry cottage cheese
- 2  eggs
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper to taste
- 3 ¾ cups all-purpose flour
- ⅓ cup nonfat dry milk powder
- ¾ teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 2  eggs
- ¾ cup water
- 4 teaspoons vegetable oil
- 3 tablespoons butter
- 1 cup cubed ham
- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ⅛ teaspoon black pepper
- 2 ½ cups warm milk

## Instructions

1. Combine cottage cheese, 2 eggs, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a mixing bowl. Beat with an electric mixer until smooth; set filling aside.
2. Stir together flour, milk powder, baking powder, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a large bowl. Beat together 2 eggs, water, and oil in a small bowl; combine with flour mixture until smooth.
3. Knead dough on a floured surface until smooth, about 10 times. Divide dough in half and roll out each portion to 1/8-inch thickness. Cut out rounds of dough with a 4-inch round cutter.
4. Place 1 tablespoon cottage cheese filling in the center of each dough round. Moisten the edges and fold over to form a half-moon shape; pinch to seal.
5. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add 1/2 of the dumplings and cook until tender, 8 to 10 minutes; remove with a slotted spoon to a plate. Cook remaining dumplings.
6. Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Stir in ham; cook until ham is light brown. Stir in 3 tablespoons flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper. Pour in milk all at once; cook and stir until thick and bubbly. Serve gravy over dumplings.
