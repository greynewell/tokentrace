## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- ⅓ cup white sugar
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1 pinch salt
- ¾ cup milk
- 2 tablespoons milk
- 1  large egg
- ¼ cup butter, melted
- 1 teaspoon raspberry extract
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 cup fresh raspberries
- ½ cup white chocolate chips
- 5 tablespoons white sugar
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon raspberry extract
- 2 tablespoons butter

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease and flour 12 muffin cups.
2. Combine 2 cups flour, 1/3 cup sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Whisk both amounts of milk with egg in another bowl; stir into flour mixture with 1/4 cup melted butter, 1 teaspoon raspberry extract, and vanilla extract until just moistened. Batter will be lumpy. Fold in raspberries and white chocolate chips; spoon batter into prepared muffin cups.
3. Mix 5 tablespoons sugar, 2 tablespoons flour, cinnamon, and 1/2 teaspoon raspberry extract in a bowl. Use a pastry cutter to chop 2 tablespoons butter into mixture until it resembles a coarse crumble; sprinkle over muffins.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 18 to 21 minutes.
