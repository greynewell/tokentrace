## Ingredients

- ½ cup all-purpose flour
- ¼ cup seasoned bread crumbs
- 2 teaspoons garlic salt
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 4 (6 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, pounded thin
- 8  bacon strips
- 1  onion, sliced
- ¼ teaspoon lemon-pepper seasoning
- ¼ teaspoon Italian seasoning
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ⅛ teaspoon red pepper flakes, or more to taste
- ¼ cup packed brown sugar
- ½ cup shredded Colby-Monterey Jack cheese

## Instructions

1. Mix flour, bread crumbs, garlic salt, and black pepper together in a bowl. Coat each chicken breast with flour mixture.
2. Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Remove bacon with a slotted spoon, reserving bacon drippings; drain bacon on paper towels.
3. Cook and stir coated chicken breasts in the bacon drippings until chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 5 minutes per side; remove and keep warm.
4. Cook and stir onion, lemon-pepper seasoning, Italian seasoning, salt, red pepper flakes, and brown sugar in the same skillet until onion is golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes.
5. Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
6. Arrange chicken breasts on a baking sheet; top each breast with 2 bacon slices. Top with caramelized onion and Colby-Monterey Jack cheese.
7. Broil chicken breasts until cheese is melted and bubbling, 1 to 3 minutes.
