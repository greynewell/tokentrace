## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups graham cracker crumbs
- ½ cup chopped pecans
- ⅓ cup white sugar
- 6 tablespoons margarine, softened
- 3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
- 2 cups white sugar
- 4  eggs, beaten
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 1 (16 ounce) container sour cream
- ½ cup white sugar

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
