## Ingredients

- 3 (6 ounce) containers plain yogurt
- 2 tablespoons active dry yeast
- ½ cup warm water
- 4 cups all-purpose flour, or as needed, divided
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 teaspoons salt
- cold water as needed

## Instructions

1. Heat yogurt in a microwave-safe bowl in a microwave or on the stovetop until lukewarm.
2. Dissolve yeast in warm water. Stir in yogurt, 2 cups flour, sugar, oil, and salt. Beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to make dough easy to handle.
3. Turn dough out on a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth. Place in a greased bowl and let rise in until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
4. Shape dough into 8 loaves; brush each lightly with cold water. Cut 3 diagonal slashes across the top of each loaf with a sharp knife. Let rise until doubled in size, about 25 minutes.
5. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Brush loaves with cold water.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until they sound hollow when tapped, 30 to 35 minutes, brushing with water twice during baking time.
