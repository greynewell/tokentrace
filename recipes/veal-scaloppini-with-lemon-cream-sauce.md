## Ingredients

- 8 (2 ounce) pieces veal scaloppini
- 1  egg, beaten
- 1 ½ cups Italian bread crumbs
- ¼ cup olive oil
- ¼ cup fresh lemon juice
- ¼ cup white wine
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 1 (15 ounce) can chicken broth
- ¼ teaspoon garlic pepper
- ¼ teaspoon lemon pepper
- 1 cup heavy cream

## Instructions

1. Dip veal into the beaten egg, then press into the bread crumbs. Gently shake off excess, and set aside.
2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add breaded scaloppini, and cook until golden brown on both sides, and no longer pink on the inside, about 4 minutes per side. Remove to a paper towel lined plate, and keep warm.
3. Pour in lemon juice and white wine. Increase heat to high, and bring to a boil. Boil for 1 minute. Dissolve the cornstarch in about 2 tablespoons of chicken broth, and set aside. Pour the remaining chicken broth into the skillet, season with garlic pepper and lemon pepper, and bring to a boil. Once the sauce is boiling, stir in the dissolved cornstarch, and cook until thickened and clear, about 1 minute. Remove the sauce from the heat, then whisk in heavy cream. Place the veal on a serving platter, and pour sauce overtop to serve.
