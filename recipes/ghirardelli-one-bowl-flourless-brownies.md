## Ingredients

- 1 ⅓ cups blanched almond flour
- ⅔ cup brown rice flour
- 2 cups Ghirardelli® 60% Cacao Bittersweet Chocolate Chips
- 12 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into chunks
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 ½ cups granulated sugar
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 4 large eggs
- 2 cups walnut or pecan pieces

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F, with a rack in the lower third of the oven. Line an 8-inch metal baking pan across the bottom and up two opposite sides with parchment paper.
2. Whisk together almond flour and rice flour; set aside.
3. Place chocolate, butter and salt in the top of a large double boiler over barely simmering water. Stir frequently until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth. Remove the bowl and let cool for 5 minutes. Stir in the sugar and vanilla. Stir in the eggs one at a time. Add the almond and rice flour mixture and stir until moistened, and then mix briskly about 40 strokes. Stir in the walnuts or pecans if using.
4. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and spread it evenly. Bake 20 to 25 minutes or until the brownies are slightly puffed all over and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out moist but clean. Cool the pan on a rack, at least 30 minutes. Run a knife along the unlined sides of the pan to detach the brownies. Lift the edges of the parchment paper to remove the brownies. Cut into squares.
