## Ingredients

- 3 cups peanut oil for frying, or as needed
- 1 cup self-rising flour
- 3  eggs
- 2 (5 ounce) bottles hot pepper sauce (such as Frank's RedHot®), divided
- ⅓ cup water
- 2 ½ pounds chicken wings and drummettes
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder, or to taste
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Place flour in a bowl. Whisk eggs, 1 bottle hot sauce, and water in another bowl until smooth. Season chicken with garlic powder, salt, and pepper.
