## Ingredients

- 1 cup walnuts
- ½ cup minced shallots
- ½ cup unsalted butter
- ¼ pound shiitake mushrooms, chopped
- ¼ pound crimini mushrooms, chopped
- ¼ pound portobello mushrooms, chopped
- 1 tablespoon roasted garlic puree
- ¼ cup chopped fresh Italian parsley
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon white pepper
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread walnuts in a single layer on a cookie sheet. Toast for 10 minutes, or until fragrant and lightly browned.
