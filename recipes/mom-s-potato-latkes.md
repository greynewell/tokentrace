## Ingredients

- 3 cups shredded potato
- ¼ cup grated onion
- 2  eggs, beaten
- 6  saltine crackers, or as needed, crushed
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper

2. Heat 1/4 inch oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat.
3. Drop spoonfuls of the potato mixture, first pressing potato mixture against the side of the bowl to remove excess liquid, into the hot oil; slightly flatten the latkes into the oil with the back of your spoon so they are an even thickness.
