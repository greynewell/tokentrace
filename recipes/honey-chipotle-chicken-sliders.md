## Ingredients

- ⅔ cup honey
- ¼ cup water
- ¼ cup ketchup
- 1 tablespoon cider vinegar
- 2 teaspoons ground chipotle powder, or to taste
- ½ teaspoon kosher salt
- ½ teaspoon hot pepper sauce
- ¾ cup all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons garlic powder, or to taste
- ¼ teaspoon kosher salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 2 large eggs, beaten
- 1 ½ cups garlic and herb seasoned dry bread crumbs
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into strips
- ½ cup canola oil, or as needed
- 8  potato rolls, or as needed
- ½ cup dill pickle slices, or to taste
- ½ cup shredded lettuce, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Combine honey, water, ketchup, vinegar, chili powder, salt, and hot sauce for honey-chipotle sauce in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring frequently, 2 to 3 minutes. When reduced to desired consistency, remove from heat.
2. Combine flour, garlic powder, salt, and pepper for chicken in a shallow bowl. Place beaten eggs in a separate bowl. Combine bread crumbs and paprika in a third bowl. Coat chicken tenders in the flour mixture, then into the egg mixture, and then in the bread crumb mixture.
3. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Place chicken in the hot oil and cook until the breading is golden brown and the chicken is fully white and no longer pink or translucent in the center, 3 to 6 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.
4. Toss tenders in honey-chipotle sauced until coated and place on the bottom half of potato rolls. Top chicken with a dill pickle round and lettuce. Serve.
