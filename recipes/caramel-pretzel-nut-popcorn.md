## Ingredients

- 8 cups broken salted pretzels
- 20 cups popped popcorn
- 4 cups dry roasted peanuts
- 3 cups brown sugar
- ¾ cup light corn syrup
- 1 ½ cups butter
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Place the pretzels, popcorn and peanuts into a large paper bag or, if you have one, a very large bowl. Set aside.
2. In a saucepan over medium heat, combine the brown sugar, corn syrup, and butter. Cook, stirring to melt the butter and dissolve the sugar, until the mixture comes to a boil. Once the mixture is at a full boil, continue to cook for 5 minutes, stirring constantly.
3. Remove from the heat, and stir in the salt, vanilla, and baking soda. The mixture will foam up when you add the soda, so use a long spoon to stir. Immediately pour the sugar mixture over the popcorn and pretzels in the bag. Shake until evenly coated. For a crispier treat, boil the sugar mixture longer, or bake the finished mix in the oven at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 10 minutes.
