## Ingredients

- 1 (16.25 ounce) package white cake mix
- 1 ¼ cups water
- 3  egg whites
- ⅓ cup vegetable oil
- 2 teaspoons lemon extract
- 1 cup cold heavy whipping cream
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- ¾ cup white sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ⅓ cup blueberry pie filling

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 8-inch pans.
2. Beat cake mix, water, egg whites, vegetable oil, and lemon extract together in a bowl using an electric mixer on medium speed until batter is well combined, about 2 minutes. Pour batter into prepared pans.
