## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 ½ tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ cups fresh blueberries
- ½ cup butter
- ¾ cup white sugar
- 2  eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ¼ teaspoon lemon zest
- ½ cup milk
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 5 tablespoons white sugar
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 2 tablespoons butter, diced

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners.
2. Make the muffins: Place blueberries in a small bowl. Sprinkle 1 1/2 tablespoons flour over top and toss gently to coat the berries.
3. Combine 2 cups flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl.
4. Beat sugar and butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Beat in eggs, one at a time, then mix in vanilla and lemon zest.
5. Without overworking the batter, gently fold in 1/2 of the dry ingredients, then all of the milk, followed by the remaining dry ingredients. Gently fold in floured blueberries; don't stir. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups.
6. Make the topping: Whisk sugar, flour, and cinnamon together in a small bowl. Cut in butter with 2 knives or a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Sprinkle topping over the batter in the muffin cups.
7. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the centers comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.
8. Remove from the oven and place pans on a wire rack to cool.
