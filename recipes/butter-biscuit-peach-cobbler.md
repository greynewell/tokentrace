## Ingredients

- 2 (29 ounce) cans peaches
- ¾ cup white sugar
- ½ cup brown sugar
- ½ cup unsalted butter
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon nutmeg
- 1 pinch salt
- 1 (16 ounce) can refrigerated buttermilk biscuit dough (such as Pillsbury Grands!®)
- 1 pinch ground cinnamon
- 1 pinch white sugar

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Mix peaches, 3/4 cup white sugar, brown sugar, butter, cornstarch, vanilla extract, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, and salt in a large pot over medium heat; cook and stir until sugars are dissolved and butter is melted, about 5 minutes.
3. Sprinkle each biscuit with 1 pinch cinnamon, 1 pinch white sugar, and 1 pinch nutmeg. Flatten biscuits on a lightly floured surface using a rolling pin.
