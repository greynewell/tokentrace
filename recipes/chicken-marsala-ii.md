## Ingredients

- ¼ cup butter, divided
- 2 cups sliced fresh mushrooms
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken meat - cut into 12 pieces
- 2 slices bacon, diced
- ¼ cup cold water
- 1 teaspoon cornstarch
- ½ cup dry Marsala wine

## Instructions

1. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a medium skillet. Saute mushrooms until soft, remove from skillet and place in a small, covered bowl.
2. Mix flour, garlic powder, salt and pepper in a shallow dish or bowl. Dredge chicken in flour mixture. Place bacon in same skillet and cook over low heat until cooked but not crisp. Add 2 tablespoons butter to skillet and saute coated chicken over medium heat for 2 minutes each side, adding remaining butter as needed to prevent burning.
