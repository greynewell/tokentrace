## Ingredients

- 2 (16 ounce) packages frozen crinkle-cut French fries
- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 2 tablespoons seafood seasoning (such as
- ®), or more to taste
- ¼ cup milk
- ½ teaspoon seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®)
- 8 ounces white American cheese (such as Kraft® Deluxe), diced

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
2. Toss French fries and oil together in a large bowl. Add 2 tablespoons seafood seasoning and toss to coat. Place on the prepared baking sheet.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until crispy, 35 to 45 minutes.
4. While fries are baking, make the cheese sauce by combining milk and seafood seasoning in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over low heat. Add cheese when milk begins to steam and little bubbles begin to form around the edges. Stir gently and frequently until all cheese is melted. Serve immediately on the side as a dipping sauce with hot fries.
