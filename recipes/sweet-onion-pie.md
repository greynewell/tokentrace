## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups buttery round crackers, crumbled
- 6 tablespoons butter, softened

- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon minced fresh chives
- ¾ cup whole milk
- 2  eggs
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¾ cup shredded Cheddar cheese

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
