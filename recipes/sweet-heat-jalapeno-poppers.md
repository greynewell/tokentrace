## Ingredients

- 10 large jalapeno peppers
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- 2 tablespoons prepared horseradish
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ¼ teaspoon paprika
- 5 slices prosciutto, cut in half lengthwise
- ⅓ cup apricot preserves
- 2 teaspoons water
- ⅛ teaspoon garlic powder
- ⅛ teaspoon red pepper flakes

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
2. Cut each jalapeno lengthwise. Use a spoon to scrape the seeds and membranes out of the halves. Place jalapeno halves on the prepared baking sheet.
