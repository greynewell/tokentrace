## Ingredients

- 4 (4 ounce) tilapia fillets
- 2 tablespoons Miami-style sazon seasoning (sazon completa)
- 1  serving olive oil cooking spray (such as PAM®)
- ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 2 tablespoons butter-margarine blend (such as Smart Balance®), melted
- 1 ½ tablespoons fat-free mayonnaise (such as Kraft®)
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 2 teaspoons grated lemon zest
- ⅛ teaspoon dried basil
- ⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ⅛ teaspoon onion powder

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. Line a broiler pan with aluminum foil. Spray the broiler pan's rack with olive oil cooking spray.
2. Sprinkle tilapia with sazon seasoning and arrange on the prepared broiler rack.
3. Cook the fillets under the preheated broiler until fish is barely opaque, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
