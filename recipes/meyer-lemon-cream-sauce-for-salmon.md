## Ingredients

- 2 (4 ounce) salmon fillets
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons butter, divided
- 1 clove garlic
- ½ cup heavy cream
- 2 teaspoons Meyer lemon juice
- ¼ pinch dried dill weed

## Instructions

1. Season salmon fillets with salt and pepper.
2. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook salmon, skin side-up, in melted butter until golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Flip salmon; continue cooking until skin is slightly browned and fish flakes easily with a fork, about 5 minutes more.
