## Ingredients

- ½ cup butter, softened
- ½ cup packed brown sugar
- ½ cup white sugar
- 1  egg
- 1 tablespoon brandy
- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ¾ cup white chocolate chips
- 1 cup dried cranberries

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 2 cookie sheets.
2. Beat brown sugar, white sugar, and butter with an electric mixer in a large bowl until creamy. Add egg and brandy and beat until incorporated.
3. Combine flour and baking soda in a separate bowl. Stir flour mixture into the butter mixture until just combined. Fold in cranberries and white chocolate chips. Drop batter by heaping spoonful onto the prepared cookie sheets.
4. Bake in the preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes, switching racks halfway through; cookies will still appear slightly doughy.
5. Remove from the oven and let cool briefly on the cookie sheets before transferring to wire racks to cool completely.
