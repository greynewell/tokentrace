## Ingredients

- 3 cups chickpea flour
- salt to taste
- 6 cups water
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley, or to taste
- ground black pepper to taste
- 1 quart vegetable oil, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Place chickpea flour and some salt in a large saucepan over low heat. Pour in water, a little at a time, while whisking to prevent lumps.
2. Once mixture is smooth and creamy, increase to medium heat and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring continuously, until the mix starts separating from the sides of the pan.
3. Add parsley and a bit of pepper. Adjust salt if needed.
4. Pour chickpea mixture onto a greased baking sheet. Spread evenly to form a 1 1/2 inch thick layer. Refrigerate until mixture has hardened, at least 30 minutes.
5. Slice chickpea mixture into 1 1/2- x 2-inch rectangles.
6. Heat vegetable oil in a deep pot until 250 degrees F (120 degrees F). Drop a few rectangles at a time into the hot oil and deep fry until crispy, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain on paper towels and serve hot.
