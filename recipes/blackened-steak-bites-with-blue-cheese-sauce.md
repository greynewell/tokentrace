## Ingredients

- 1 ½ pounds beef top sirloin, trimmed and cut into bite-size pieces
- 2 tablespoons blackened seasoning (such as Chef Paul Prudhomme's® Blackened Steak Magic®), or more to taste
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese
- 3 tablespoons evaporated milk
- 8 ounces blue cheese crumbles
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ¼ teaspoon ground white pepper
- ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper

## Instructions

1. Season sirloin with blackened seasoning to coat on all sides.
2. Heat oil in a cast-iron skillet on an outdoor grill until the oil is smoking. Cook steak bites in hot oil in small batches, reheating oil between batches, until slightly crusty, 1 to 2 minutes per side.
3. Stir cream cheese and evaporated milk together in a saucepan over low heat to melt the cream cheese. Whisk blue cheese crumbles, garlic powder, white pepper, and cayenne pepper into the cream cheese mixture; simmer, stirring frequently, until the blue cheese melts into a smooth sauce, 2 to 3 minutes. Serve blue cheese sauce with the beef bites.
