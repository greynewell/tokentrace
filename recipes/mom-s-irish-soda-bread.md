## Ingredients

- 1 cup buttermilk, divided
- 1 ½ cups golden raisins
- ½ cup butter, melted - divided
- 4 cups all-purpose flour
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1  egg

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch pie plate.
2. Spoon 1 tablespoon buttermilk into a small bowl; pour remaining buttermilk into a medium bowl.
3. Stir 1 tablespoon melted butter into buttermilk in the small bowl until combined. Stir golden raisins into buttermilk in the medium bowl. Let both bowls sit until needed.
4. Whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and pour in remaining melted butter; stir until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add egg and mix until thoroughly combined.
5. Add buttermilk-raisin mixture to flour mixture; shape into a ball. Transfer dough to the prepared pie dish and lightly pat around the edges so the top is slightly domed. Slice the top in a 1/4-inch deep crisscross with a sharp knife. Brush buttermilk-butter mixture over loaf until thoroughly coated, getting mixture into all crevices.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until loaf is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 55 minutes to 1 hour.
