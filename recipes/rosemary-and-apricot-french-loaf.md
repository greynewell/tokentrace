## Ingredients

- 1 ⅜ cups water
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt
- ½ cup dried apricots, quartered
- 4 cups bread flour
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons bread machine yeast

## Instructions

1. Place water, olive oil, and salt into one side of a bread machine. Place 1/3 of the apricots on top of this fluid mixture with 2 cups of flour. Place more apricots in the middle of the flour, pour remaining flour on top, followed by remaining apricots. This will help weaker bread machines integrate the apricots.
