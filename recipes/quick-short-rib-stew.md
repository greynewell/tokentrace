## Ingredients

- ½ cup all-purpose flour for coating
- 4 pounds beef short ribs
- 2 tablespoons canola or vegetable oil
- 1 cup hot water
- 2 cubes beef bouillon
- 1 (28 ounce) can diced or stewed tomatoes
- 2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
- 2 medium onions, chopped
- 6 medium carrots, peeled and sliced
- 6 medium potatoes, peeled and cubed
- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour, dissolved in
- 1 cup water
- 1 (15 ounce) can peas, with liquid
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat.
2. Place 1/2 cup flour in a resealable plastic bag or large bowl; add ribs and toss until completely coated. Pour oil into the preheated pan; heat until shimmering. Shake any excess flour off ribs, then add to hot oil. Cool until brown on all sides, about 10 minutes.
3. While ribs are browning, stir together 1 cup hot water and bouillon cubes in a pressure cooker until dissolved. Use tongs to remove ribs from the skillet to the pressure cooker. Seal according to manufacturer's directions and cook for 25 minutes.
4. Release pressure and open the cooker according to manufacturer's directions. Pour in canned tomatoes, carrots, onions, and garlic. Simmer, uncovered, until vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes.
5. Meanwhile, place potatoes in a large pot and cover with water by 1 inch. Bring to a boil and cook until tender, about 20 minutes.
6. Remove ribs to a serving platter. Stir together 1 cup water and 3 tablespoons flour in a liquid measure. Stir into vegetables in the pressure cooker and cook until sauce thickens, about 5 minutes.
7. Drain cooked potatoes and add to stew along with peas. Cook until warmed through, then season with salt and pepper.
