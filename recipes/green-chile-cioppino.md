## Ingredients

- 4 peppers Anaheim chile peppers, halved and seeded
- ¾ cup salted butter
- 2 medium onions, chopped
- ½ bunch fresh cilantro, chopped
- 6 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 (14.5 ounce) cans diced tomatoes, undrained
- 2 (14.5 ounce) cans chicken broth
- 1 ½ cups white wine
- 1 cup water
- 2 leaf (blank)s bay leaves
- 1 tablespoon dried basil
- ½ teaspoon dried thyme
- ½ teaspoon dried oregano

## Instructions

1. Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place peppers with cut sides down onto the prepared baking sheet.
2. Cook under the preheated broiler until pepper skins have blackened and blistered, 5 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Allow peppers to steam as they cool, about 20 minutes. Remove and discard skins.
3. Puree peppers in the bowl of a food processor or blender; set aside.
4. Melt butter in a large stockpot over medium-low heat. Add onions, cilantro, and garlic; cook slowly, stirring occasionally, until onions are soft, 7 to 10 minutes. Pour in tomatoes and their juices. Add chicken broth, wine, water, bay leaves, basil, thyme, and oregano; mix well. Cover and simmer for 30 minutes. Ladle into bowls.
5. Increase heat and bring to a boil. Add clams and mussels; simmer, 4 to 5 minutes. Add cod and scallops; reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 5 minutes.
6. Add shrimp and lobster tails. Cook until clams and mussels open, cod and scallops are opaque, shrimp is pink, and lobster shells are bright red and meat is opaque, about 5 minutes more. Don't overcook or seafood will become tough.
