## Ingredients

- ¾ cup ketchup
- ¾ cup water
- 2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- 2 teaspoons brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon paprika
- ½ teaspoon chili powder
- ⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 6  (3/4 inch) thick pork chops

## Instructions

1. Combine ketchup, water, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, brown sugar, salt, paprika, chili powder, and pepper in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low; simmer, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Set aside 1/2 of the sauce for serving.
2. Preheat the oven broiler. Place an oven rack 4 inches from heat.
3. Brush both sides of chops with sauce, then place on a broiling pan rack.
4. Broil chops for 4 minutes on each side. Brush with more sauce. Continue broiling, turning and basting every 3 to 4 minutes, until juices run clear. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
5. Serve pork chops with reserved sauce.
