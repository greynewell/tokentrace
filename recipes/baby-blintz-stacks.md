## Ingredients

- 1 (24 ounce) carton cottage cheese
- 2  fresh peaches - peeled, pitted and chopped
- 3 tablespoons white sugar
- ½ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon almond extract
- ½ cup sour cream
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- ½ teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 2 cups milk
- 2  eggs
- 2 tablespoons melted butter
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2  fresh peaches, pitted and sliced

## Instructions

1. Stir together the cottage cheese, chopped peaches, 3 tablespoons white sugar, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and the almond extract in a bowl until evenly combined. Stir together the sour cream and brown sugar in a separate bowl. Refrigerate both fillings until ready to use.
2. Whisk together the flour, 1 tablespoon of white sugar, the baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and the nutmeg in a bowl. Beat the eggs, milk, butter, and vanilla extract in a separate bowl until smooth. Stir in the flour mixture until no lumps remain.
3. Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle to form silver dollar-sized blintzes. Cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 minutes. Flip, and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.
4. To assemble, spread 1 tablespoon of peach filling on top of each blintz. Stack together 5 blintzes to make a serving portion, and spoon the sweetened sour cream overtop. Garnish with peach slices.
