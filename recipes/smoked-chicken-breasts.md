## Ingredients

- 4 cups water
- ¼ cup kosher salt
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon cider vinegar
- 4 pounds skin-on, bone-in chicken breasts
- maple wood chips
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon onion powder

## Instructions

1. Make brine: Combine water, kosher salt, brown sugar, and apple cider vinegar in a large bowl. Stir until salt and brown sugar are dissolved. Place chicken breasts into brine, cover, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours to overnight.
2. Preheat an electric smoker according to manufacturer's directions to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C) using maple wood chips.
3. Remove chicken breasts from brine and rinse under cold water. Pat dry and set aside.
4. Make rub: Combine brown sugar, salt, black pepper, paprika, garlic powder, and onion powder in a bowl. Sprinkle dry rub all over chicken breasts and place skin-side up on a grill rack in the preheated smoker. Place a drip pan underneath.
5. Smoke chicken breasts in the preheated smoker until chicken is no longer pink and the juices run clear, about 4 hours, adding maple wood chips as necessary to keep the smoke continuous. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
