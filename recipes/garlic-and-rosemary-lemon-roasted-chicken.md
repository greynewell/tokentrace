## Ingredients

- 1 medium lemon
- ½ medium onion
- ½ teaspoon garlic salt
- ½ teaspoon ground sage
- ½ teaspoon ground turmeric
- ½ teaspoon ground thyme
- ½ teaspoon ground basil
- ½ teaspoon ground rosemary
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 (4 pound) whole chicken
- 1 cup arugula
- 6 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed
- 7 tablespoons garlic-infused ghee, divided
- 1 tablespoon butter

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with foil.
2. Roll the lemon and cut in half lengthwise. Slice one half into quarters and set the other half aside for baking and basting. Cut onion into 4 pieces; slice one piece and sprinkle on the prepared baking sheet. Set remaining onion pieces aside.
3. Mix garlic salt, sage, turmeric, basil, rosemary, and pepper together until well combined; divide evenly into 2 bowls.
4. Rinse chicken in cold water and dry off. Trim and discard excess fat and separate skin from meat. Stuff inside of the chicken with arugula, 4 lemon slices, 3 onion pieces, and garlic cloves. Tie the legs together with twine. Spread 2 tablespoons ghee underneath the skin and another 2 tablespoons ghee on top of the skin, all over the chicken.
5. Add 2 tablespoon ghee and butter to one bowl of spices. Microwave for 45 seconds. Stir and spread underneath the skin. Microwave remaining 1 tablespoon ghee and brush on top of skin. Sprinkle remaining seasoning all over chicken and pat into the skin; do not rub. Lightly squeeze some of the remaining lemon half on top of chicken and place chicken, breast-side up, on the onion slices on the baking sheet.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 1 hour and 30 minutes, basting with juices and remaining lemon juice every 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove from the oven and let rest for 10 minutes before slicing, continuing to baste.
