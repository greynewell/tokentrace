## Ingredients

- 7 ounces semisweet chocolate
- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder
- 1 ¼ teaspoons ground ginger
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ¼ teaspoon ground cloves
- ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ½ cup unsalted butter
- 1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger
- ½ cup packed dark brown sugar
- ¼ cup unsulphured molasses
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 ½ cups boiling water
- ¼ cup white sugar

## Instructions

1. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Chop chocolate into 1/4-inch chunks; set aside. Sift 1 1/2 cups plus 1 tablespoon flour, cocoa, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg together in a medium bowl.
2. Beat butter and ginger together in the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment until whitened, about 4 minutes. Add brown sugar; beat until combined. Add molasses; beat until combined.
3. Dissolve baking soda in boiling water. Beat half of the flour mixture into the butter mixture. Beat in baking soda mixture followed by remaining flour mixture. Mix in chocolate; turn out onto a piece of plastic wrap. Pat dough out to about 1-inch thickness; seal with plastic. Refrigerate until firm, 2 hours or more.
4. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
5. Roll dough into 1 1/2-inch balls and place 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets. Refrigerate for 20 minutes. Roll in white sugar.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until the surfaces crack slightly, 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes; transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
