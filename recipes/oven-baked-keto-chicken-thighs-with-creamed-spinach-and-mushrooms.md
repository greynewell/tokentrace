## Ingredients

- 4 slices bacon
- 6  skinless, boneless chicken thighs
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ½ cup chopped onion
- 8 ounces fresh mushrooms, chopped
- 2 pounds frozen chopped spinach -  thawed, drained, and squeezed dry
- 3 tablespoons ghee, plus more for greasing
- 1 cup chicken broth
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1 (5.2 ounce) package garlic and herb cheese spread (such as Boursin®), softened
- 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided
- ½ cup sliced almonds
- ½ cup crushed pork rinds

## Instructions

1. Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels and crumble once cool enough to handle. Reserve bacon drippings.
2. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
3. Pat chicken thighs dry and season with salt and pepper.
4. Heat reserved bacon drippings in a large skillet over medium heat and cook onions and mushrooms, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms are soft and onions are translucent, 7 to 8 minutes. Place vegetables into a large mixing bowl and mix in well-dried spinach. Set aside.
5. Wipe the skillet clean. Add ghee and melt over medium heat. Once skillet is hot, add chicken thighs and lightly brown on each side, 3 to 4 minutes per side; the chicken will still be pink in the middle. Remove chicken from skillet and set aside.
6. Combine chicken broth, cream, softened garlic and herb cheese spread , and 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese in a small bowl; whisk until well combined. Pour broth mixture over vegetable mixture in the mixing bowl and mix to combine. Season with salt and pepper. Add vegetable mixture to skillet and place browned chicken thighs on top. Top with crumbled bacon, sliced almonds, ground pork rinds, and remaining 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese.
7. Bake in the preheated oven until chicken thighs are no longer pink at the bone, juices run clear, and spinach mixture is bubbly, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove from the oven and allow to rest about 10 minutes before serving.
