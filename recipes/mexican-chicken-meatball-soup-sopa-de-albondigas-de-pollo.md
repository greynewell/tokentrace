## Ingredients

- 4  Roma tomatoes, quartered
- ½  onion
- 3 cloves garlic
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 2 ½ quarts chicken stock
- 2 pounds ground chicken breast
- 3  Roma tomatoes, seeded and finely chopped
- ½  onion, finely chopped
- 1  egg
- ¼ cup basmati rice
- 1 tablespoon finely chopped mint leaves
- ¼ teaspoon dried oregano
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 2 large zucchini, cubed
- 2  chayote squash - peeled, cored, and cubed
- 2  carrots, peeled and cubed
- salt to taste

## Instructions

1. Combine 4 tomatoes, 1/2 an onion, and garlic in a blender. Blend until smooth.
2. Heat oil in a soup pot over medium heat. Add the blended tomato mixture; cook until mixture changes color, about 5 minutes. Add chicken stock, reduce heat, and simmer while you prepare the meatballs.
3. Place ground chicken in a bowl. Add 3 chopped tomatoes, chopped onion, egg, rice, mint, oregano, salt, and pepper. Mix well with your hands until mixture is uniform. Take about 1/4 cup of mixture and form into round meatballs using wet hands. Place on a baking sheet. Repeat with remaining chicken mixture.
4. Bring stock mixture to a boil. Place a meatball into a ladle and submerge into the boiling stock. Remove ladle and repeat with remaining meatballs.
5. Place zucchini, chayote, and carrots into the stock. Bring to a boil again. Lower heat, season with salt, and cover. Simmer until meatballs are no longer pink in the center and vegetables are soft, about 30 minutes.
