## Ingredients

- 1 (14.5 ounce) can sauerkraut with liquid
- 1 (3 pound) corned beef brisket
- 1 (12 ounce) bottle dark beer
- 1 medium onion, sliced
- 3 cloves garlic, peeled and whole
- 2 tablespoons pickling spice (such as McCormick®)
- ½ pound sliced Swiss cheese
- 6 slices rye bread
- ½ cup Thousand Island dressing

## Instructions

1. Place sauerkraut in a slow cooker and place corned beef on top. Place beer, onion, garlic cloves, and pickling spice in the slow cooker, around and on top of the corned beef.
2. Cook on Low until brisket is very tender, 7 to 8 hours. Remove brisket from the slow cooker and let rest for 10 minutes.
3. Drain and discard excess liquid from the slow cooker so you can easily access the sauerkraut.
4. Thinly slice corned beef against the grain. Assemble open-faced sandwiches by layering corned beef, sauerkraut, and Swiss cheese slices on rye bread. Reserve remaining corned beef for another use.
5. Place open-faced sandwiches in a toaster oven and toast until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes. Serve with Thousand Island dressing as a condiment.
