## Ingredients

- 1 (10 pound) prime rib roast
- 10 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 2 teaspoons ground black pepper
- 2 teaspoons dried thyme

## Instructions

1. Place roast in a roasting pan with the fatty side up. Mix garlic, olive oil, salt, pepper, and thyme together in a small bowl. Spread mixture over the top of roast; let roast sit out until it is at room temperature, no longer than 1 hour.
2. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).
3. Bake roast in the preheated oven for 30 minutes; reduce the temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C), and continue roasting for an additional 60 to 75 minutes. The internal temperature of the roast should be at 135 degrees F (57 degrees C) for medium rare.
4. Allow roast to rest for 10 or 15 minutes before carving so the meat can retain its juices.
