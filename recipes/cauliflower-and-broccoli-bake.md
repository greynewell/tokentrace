## Ingredients

- 6 ounces fresh cauliflower
- 6 ounces fresh broccoli
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 ½ tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 2 ½ cups milk
- 1 (8 ounce) package shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
- 1 teaspoon English mustard
- cayenne pepper to taste
- salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Place cauliflower and broccoli in a medium saucepan; pour in enough water to cover. Bring to a boil and cook until tender, about 10 minutes; drain and transfer into a medium baking dish.
3. Meanwhile, melt butter in a separate medium saucepan over low heat; stir in flour to form a thick paste. Gradually whisk in milk until mixture has thickened, about 5 minutes. Whisk in mustard, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper. Sprinkle in 2/3 of the cheese, and stir until melted.
4. Pour sauce over broccoli and cauliflower. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and lightly brown, about 30 minutes. Sprinkle with the remaining cheese during the final 10 minutes of cooking.
