## Ingredients

- 1 ¼ pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cubed
- 3 cloves garlic, halved
- 1 pound lean ground beef
- 2 tablespoons flour
- ¾ cup beef broth
- 3 tablespoons ketchup
- 4 cups frozen mixed vegetables
- ½ teaspoon black pepper
- ½ cup shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
- ¾ cup light sour cream
- 1 teaspoon salt

## Instructions

1. Place cubed potatoes and garlic in a large pot with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes.
2. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
3. Brown ground beef over medium heat in a skillet. Stir in flour, mixing with beef drippings.
4. Add beef broth, ketchup and vegetables. Stir to combine. Cook for 5 minutes, until thick.
5. Transfer beef mixture into an oven-proof casserole dish.
6. Drain potatoes and smash them a little bit before adding 1/4 cup of grated cheese and sour cream. Mash together until smooth.
7. Spoon potatoes onto the middle of the meat mixture. With a fork, spread potatoes from the center to the edges to form the top layer.
8. Sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup of grated cheese.
9. Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until cheese is melted and golden. Let cool 15 minutes before serving.
