## Ingredients

- 1 cup water
- ½ cup salt
- ½ cup white sugar
- 1 tablespoon dried sage
- 1 tablespoon garlic powder
- 10 cups cold water
- 2 ½ pounds pork loin chops
- 2 tablespoons olive oil, or as needed, divided

## Instructions

1. Bring 1 cup water to a boil in a saucepan. Add salt, sugar, sage, and garlic powder. Remove from heat and stir until mostly dissolved. Add cold water to cool the brining mixture. Place pork chops in a plastic freezer bag or other airtight container. Add brining liquid, close tightly, and refrigerate for 6 hours.
2. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a baking dish with about 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil.
3. Drain pork chops, discarding brine. Place chops in the prepared dish and brush lightly with remaining olive oil.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until chops are no longer pink in the center and juice is clear, about 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
