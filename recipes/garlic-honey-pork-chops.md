## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons honey
- 3 tablespoons stone-ground mustard
- 5 cloves garlic, sliced
- 1 teaspoon red chile flakes
- 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
- ½ cup apple cider vinegar
- kosher salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 4 (1-inch thick) bone-in pork chops

## Instructions

1. Combine honey, mustard, garlic, chile flakes, 3 tablespoon olive oil, apple cider vinegar, salt, and pepper in a small bowl; mix until fully combined.
2. Place pork chops into a resealable zip-top bag. Pour in marinade, seal the bag, massage to coat, and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.
3. Remove pork chops from the marinade and place on paper towels. Pat chops as dry as possible with the paper towels. Set excess marinade aside.
4. Heat remaining olive oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high or high heat until it shimmers. Working in batches if necessary, sear the pork chops in the hot pan until the first side is a dark golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn and cook on the other side until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes more. Turn the heat down to low and continue to cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), 6 to 8 minutes total. Transfer to a plate and let rest for 5 minutes.
5. While pork rests, pour leftover marinade into a skillet. Bring to a boil and continue to cook until it reduces and becomes as thick as you like, 5 to 7 minutes. Pour over pork chops.
