## Ingredients

- 1 cup Irish stout beer (such as Guinness®)
- 1 cup butter
- ¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 cups white sugar
- 1 ½ teaspoons baking soda
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- 2  large eggs
- ⅔ cup sour cream
- ⅔ cup heavy whipping cream
- 8 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 teaspoon Irish whiskey, or more to taste
- ½ cup butter, softened
- 3 cups confectioners' sugar, or more as needed
- 3 tablespoons Irish cream liqueur (such as Baileys®), or more to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 24 muffin cups with paper liners.
2. Bring Irish stout beer and 1 cup butter to a boil in a saucepan and set aside until butter has melted, stirring occasionally. Mix in cocoa powder until smooth.
3. Whisk together flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt in a bowl until thoroughly combined.
4. Beat eggs with sour cream in a large bowl with an electric mixer on low until well combined. Slowly beat in beer mixture, then flour mixture; beat until batter is smooth.
5. Divide batter between the prepared cupcake cups, filling each cup about 2/3 full.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean, about 17 minutes.
7. Cool the cupcakes completely. Cut cores out of the center of each cupcake with a sharp paring knife. Discard cores.
8. Bring cream to a simmer in a saucepan over low heat; stir in bittersweet chocolate until melted.
9. Mix in 2 tablespoons butter and Irish whiskey until butter is melted; let mixture cool to room temperature. Filling will thicken as it cools.
10. Spoon the filling into the cored cupcakes.
11. For frosting: Whip 1/2 cup butter in a bowl with an electric mixer until fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes.
12. Set mixer to low speed and slowly beat in confectioners' sugar, one cup at a time, until frosting is smooth and spreadable. Beat in Irish cream liqueur; adjust the thickness of frosting with more confectioners' sugar if needed.
13. Spread frosting on filled cupcakes.
