## Ingredients

- 1 cup golden raisins
- 1 tablespoon vodka
- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- ¼ cup lukewarm water
- 1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
- 1 cup milk
- 1 pinch saffron threads
- 1 teaspoon ground cardamom
- ½ cup white sugar
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- ½ cup butter, melted
- ½ cup white sugar
- ¼ cup orange blossom honey
- 1  lemon, zested
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 pinch salt
- 2  eggs
- 1  egg yolk
- 3 cups all-purpose flour, divided
- ½ cup sliced almonds
- 4 clean 14-ounce food cans
- 1  egg white
- 1 ½ cups confectioners' sugar, or more as needed
- ½ teaspoon lemon juice
- 2 tablespoons toasted sliced almonds, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Make the kulich: Place raisins into a bowl, drizzle with vodka, and let soften, 8 hours to overnight.
2. Heat milk in a saucepan over medium-low heat until very warm but not simmering. Stir in cardamom and saffron threads. Remove from the heat and let stand until lukewarm.
3. Meanwhile, mix 1 teaspoon sugar into lukewarm water in a bowl until sugar dissolves. Stir in yeast and let stand until frothy, about 10 minutes.
4. Transfer yeast mixture to a large mixing bowl. Add milk mixture, 1 cup flour, and 1/2 cup sugar; beat until smooth. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let dough rise in a warm place for 1 hour.
5. Zest lemon onto waxed paper. Juice lemon into another small bowl and reserve for frosting. Separate egg whites and yolks, reserving 1 egg white for frosting.
6. Mix remaining 1/2 cup sugar, melted butter, honey, vanilla, lemon zest, and salt together in a bowl. Pour into the risen dough and beat until combined. Beat in 3 egg yolks and 2 egg whites.
7. Mix in 2 1/2 cups flour. Sprinkle remaining 1/2 cup flour onto a work surface and knead dough until it holds together, about 5 minutes. Knead soaked golden raisins and sliced almonds into dough until well distributed.
8. Form dough into a ball and place into an oiled bowl; turn dough around in the bowl several times until coated with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and allow to rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours.
9. Coat the insides of four clean 14-ounce cans with remaining 1 tablespoon butter. Line cans with parchment paper.
10. Punch down dough, knead a few times, and divide into 4 equal pieces. Roll each piece of dough into a ball, place into a can, and press dough lightly against the inside bottom of can. Cover cans with a cloth and allow dough to rise to the top of the cans, about 45 minutes.
11. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
12. Place a baking sheet into the preheated oven. Place the cans of dough upright onto the baking sheet and bake until kulich are risen and lightly browned, 45 to 50 minutes.
13. Remove from the oven and let cool in the cans for about 15 minutes, then gently remove from the cans and finish cooling on a wire rack, 25 to 40 minutes.
14. Make the frosting: Beat reserved egg white in a bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until frothy. Beat in confectioners' sugar until stiff peaks form. Beat 1 teaspoon reserved lemon juice into frosting; save remaining lemon juice for another use.
15. Frost tops of the cooled kulich and sprinkle with toasted almonds.
