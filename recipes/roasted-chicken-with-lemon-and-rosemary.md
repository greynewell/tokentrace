## Ingredients

- 1 whole chicken, cut into 8 pieces
- 1  onion, cut into wedges
- 1  lemon, sliced
- 8 cloves garlic
- 4 sprigs fresh rosemary
- ¼ cup olive oil
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
2. Combine chicken, onion, lemon slices, garlic, and rosemary together in a large bowl. Drizzle olive oil and sprinkle salt and black pepper over the chicken mixture; toss to coat. Spread chicken mixture out in the bottom of a baking dish.
