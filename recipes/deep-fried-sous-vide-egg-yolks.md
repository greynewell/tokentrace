## Ingredients

- 7  eggs, divided
- ⅓ cup all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon sea salt
- ½ teaspoon baking powder
- ½ cup fine bread crumbs
- canola oil for frying
- 1 tablespoon lemon zest  (Optional)
- 1 teaspoon black truffle salt

## Instructions

1. Immerse 6 eggs in a large pot or container of water with a sous vide insert. Set temperature to 148.1 degrees F (64.5 degrees C); cook for 1 hour. Let eggs cool in a bowl of tepid water for 10 minutes.
2. Turn on your faucet to very low. Crack each cooked egg into your hand carefully and let the white drip away under the water. Place yolks in a bowl.
3. Combine flour, sea salt, and baking powder in a small bowl. Whisk the remaining egg in a second bowl. Spread breadcrumbs on a plate.
4. Heat about 1 1/2 inches oil in a large saucepan to 360 degrees F (182 degrees C).
5. Roll each yolk gently in the flour mixture. Dip into the egg wash and roll in the breadcrumbs. Place coated yolks in the hot oil; fry until lightly golden brown, about 30 seconds. Drain on a paper towel. Sprinkle lemon zest and truffle salt on top.
