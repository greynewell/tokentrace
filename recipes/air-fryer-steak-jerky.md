## Ingredients

- 1 pound beef sirloin steak, cut into thin strips
- ¼ cup reduced-sodium soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon steak seasoning
- 1 ½ teaspoons brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
- ½ teaspoon liquid smoke flavoring
- skewers

## Instructions

1. Combine steak strips, soy sauce, steak seasoning, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, and liquid smoke in a resealable plastic bag. Marinate for at least 8 hours, or overnight.
2. Measure skewers to fit across the air fryer basket, slightly overlapping the edge. Trim off excess length.
3. Preheat the air fryer to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C) for 10 minutes.
4. Thread beef strips onto skewers, leaving room in between each strip, while the air fryer is preheating.
5. Air fry for 2 hours. Adjust cooking time as most air fryers have a maximum setting of 30 minutes. Rearrange the skewers during the reset time.
6. Reduce temperature to 180 degrees F (80 degrees C). Air fry for an additional 15 minutes.
7. Remove strips to a paper towel-lined storage container. Seal. Allow to rest overnight before serving.
