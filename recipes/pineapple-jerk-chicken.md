## Ingredients

- 1 cup uncooked long-grain rice
- 1 pound boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1/2- to 3/4-inch pieces
- 1 teaspoon Jamaican jerk seasoning blend
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 1 (20 ounce) can pineapple chunks, drained
- 1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed
- 1 (4.5 ounce) can chopped green chilies
- ½ cup jerk marinade

## Instructions

1. Prepare rice according to package directions.
2. Meanwhile, warm oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle chicken with jerk seasoning. Cook chicken pieces in hot oil until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer chicken to a plate.
