## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 3 tablespoons baking powder
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt
- 1 ½ teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 2 pounds chicken wings, split and tips discarded
- ⅓ cup water
- ⅓ cup balsamic vinegar
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons honey
- 2 tablespoons chili sauce (such as Heinz®)
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon water
- ¼ teaspoon cornstarch
- 1  green onion, thinly sliced
- ¼ teaspoon toasted sesame seeds

## Instructions

1. Make the chicken: Preheat an air fryer to 380 degrees F (190 degrees C). Coat the fryer basket with cooking spray.
2. Whisk baking powder, salt, pepper, and paprika together in a small bowl. Transfer to a resealable bag. Add some wings to the bag, seal, and shake until coated. Remove wings to a plate, shaking off any excess powder. Repeat until all wings are coated.
3. Lightly spray wings with cooking spray. Place into the prepared air fryer basket and cook for 20 minutes, shaking and flipping wings halfway through. Increase the temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) and continue to cook until wings are crispy, about 5 minutes more. Depending on the size of your air fryer, you may have to cook in batches.
4. While the wings are cooking, make the glaze: Combine 1/3 cup water, balsamic vinegar, soy sauce, honey, chili sauce, and garlic in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a low boil and cook until sauce has reduced, about 15 minutes. Whisk together 1 teaspoon water and cornstarch in a small bowl; pour into the saucepan and stir until sauce has thickened.
5. Place crispy wings into a large bowl, drizzle with sauce, and toss until well coated. Garnish with sliced green onion and sesame seeds, and serve immediately.
