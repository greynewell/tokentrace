## Ingredients

- 3 pounds large mussels
- 1 small onion, chopped
- ¼ cup dry white wine
- ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 3 tablespoons dry bread crumbs
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Scrape mussels under cold running water and remove beards. Discard any mussels that do not close when tapped.
3. Combine mussels, onion, wine, and pepper in a medium pot and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-high and cook, shaking pot frequently, until mussels open, about 5 minutes.
4. Combine bread crumbs, parsley, and garlic in a small dish. Whisk oil and lemon juice together in a second small bowl.
5. Snap each mussel into 2 parts and place the shell with the meat in an oven-proof dish. Make sure no liquid remains on the shell; discard the empty shells. Spoon parsley mixture over the mussels and drizzle with the oil mixture.
6. Bake mussels in the preheated oven until topping is crunchy, about 10 minutes.
