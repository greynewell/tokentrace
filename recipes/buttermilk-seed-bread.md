## Ingredients

- 1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- ¾ cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
- 1 ½ cups buttermilk
- 2 tablespoons margarine, melted
- 3 tablespoons honey
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 2 tablespoons sesame seeds
- 2 tablespoons flax seeds
- 2 tablespoons poppy seeds
- 2 tablespoons sunflower seeds
- 2 cups whole wheat flour
- 4 cups bread flour

## Instructions

1. In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in the warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.
2. Combine buttermilk, butter or margarine, honey and the yeast mixture in a large bowl. Add the salt, all of the seeds and the whole wheat flour. Stir to combine. Add the bread flour, 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well with a wooden spoon after each addition. When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 6 minutes.
3. Lightly oil a large mixing bowl, place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with the oil. Cover with a damp cloth and put in a warm place to rise until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
4. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees F). Grease two 9x5 inch loaf pans.
5. Deflate the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough into two equal pieces and form into loaves. Place the loaves into the prepared pans. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise until doubled in volume, about 40 minutes.
6. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for about 30 minutes or until the tops are brown and the bottom of a loaf sounds hollow when tapped.
