## Ingredients

- 4  (1 pint) wide-mouth canning jars with lids and rings
- 1 tablespoon shortening
- 1 cup raisins
- 1 cup hot water
- 1 ½ cups white sugar
- 1 cup shortening
- 3  eggs
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
- 2 teaspoons baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon baking powder
- 2 cups finely shredded zucchini
- 1 cup chopped walnuts  (Optional)
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease pint jars with 1 tablespoon shortening.
2. Soak raisins in hot water until plump, about 10 minutes. Drain.
3. Combine sugar, 1 cup shortening, and eggs in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until creamy. Beat in raisins. Add flour, cinnamon, baking soda, salt, and baking powder; beat until blended. Fold zucchini, walnuts, and vanilla extract into the batter.
4. Divide batter among greased jars, filling each one 2/3 full. Arrange jars on a rimmed baking sheet.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Turn off oven, keeping jars inside. Remove jars one at a time from the oven using oven mitts; trim off excess cake, wipe rims, and screw on lids.
6. Place jars several inches apart on a cloth-covered or wood surface and let cool completely, about 2 hours. Store jars in the refrigerator.
