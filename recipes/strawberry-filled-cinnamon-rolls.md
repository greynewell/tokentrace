## Ingredients

- ¼ cup warm water
- 2 tablespoons yeast
- ¼ cup unsalted butter, at room temperature, cubed
- ¼ cup white sugar
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup hot water
- 1 large egg, at room temperature
- 4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon oil, or as needed
- ½ cup unsalted butter, melted
- ¼ cup strawberry jam
- ⅓ cup white sugar
- 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon, or to taste
- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
- ¼ cup milk
- ¼ cup strawberry jam
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 cup powdered sugar, or more as needed

## Instructions

1. Mix warm water and yeast for rolls together in a small bowl until dissolved. Let sit until bubbly, about 10 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, combine butter, sugar, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Add hot water and whisk until butter is melted. Allow to cool for a few minutes, then mix in egg. Mix in yeast mixture, followed by 2 cups flour, mixing on high speed with the whisk attachment. Change to the dough hook attachment, add remaining flour, and mix until a nice ball of dough forms.
3. Place dough into an oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise until doubled in size, 45 minutes to 1 hour.
4. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
5. Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface into a 1/2-inch thick rectangle.
6. Mix melted butter and jam for filling together in a small bowl. Spread evenly over dough and sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon. Roll dough and pinch edges to seal. Cut into 12 equal rolls and place on a cookie sheet.
7. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and firm to the touch when pressed gently in the center, about 20 minutes.
8. While the rolls are baking, combine softened butter, milk, jam, and vanilla extract for frosting in a large bowl; beat until creamy. Gradually add powdered sugar, mixing until smooth. Add frosting with a pastry brush to warm cinnamon rolls.
