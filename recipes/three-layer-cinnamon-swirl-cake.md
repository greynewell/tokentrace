## Ingredients

- 1 cup butter, softened
- 2 cups white sugar
- 4  eggs
- 3 cups cake flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cardamom
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup milk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ½ teaspoon almond extract
- ⅓ cup packed dark brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
- ½ cup butter, softened
- 5 ½ cups powdered sugar
- ⅓ cup milk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour three 9-inch round cake pans.
2. Beat butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer until creamy. Gradually add sugar and beat until fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating briefly after each addition.
3. Combine flour, baking powder, cardamom, and salt in a large bowl. Add flour mixture to butter mixture in 3 batches, alternating with milk, beating batter briefly after each addition. Add vanilla and almond extracts; beat until smooth.
4. Transfer about 1/3 of the batter to a small bowl and divide it evenly amongst the prepared cake pans.
5. Add brown sugar and cinnamon to remaining batter and beat until well mixed. Pour into the cake pans and swirl with a spoon to mix slightly.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Run a table knife around the edges to loosen. Invert carefully onto a serving plate or cooling rack. Let cool, about 30 minutes.
7. While cakes are cooling, cream butter for the frosting in a large bowl. Slowly add 2 1/2 cups powdered sugar; beat until mixed. Add remaining powdered sugar alternately with milk and vanilla extract. Beat until frosting is smooth and reaches a thick spreading consistency.
8. Frost and stack layers of cake and sprinkle cinnamon on top.
