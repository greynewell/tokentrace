## Ingredients

- 1 cup chopped pecans
- 10 large croissants, torn into pieces
- 4 cups milk
- 3 large eggs, slightly beaten
- 2 cups white sugar
- 1 ½ tablespoons vanilla extract
- 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1 cup milk chocolate chips

- 1 cup white sugar
- ½ cup half-and-half

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking pan.
