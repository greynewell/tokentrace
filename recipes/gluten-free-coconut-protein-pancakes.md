## Ingredients

- ¼ cup coconut flour
- 1 scoop gluten-free protein powder (such as GNC Pro Performance® Isolate)
- 2 large eggs
- ½ cup 2% milk, or more to taste
- ¼ cup unsweetened coconut flakes
- ¼ cup miniature chocolate chips, or more to taste
- olive oil cooking spray
- 1  banana, sliced
- 1 teaspoon honey, or more to taste

## Instructions

1. Combine coconut flour and protein powder in a bowl. Whisk in eggs. Add milk, 1/4 cup at a time, mixing thoroughly, until batter is not too thick or too runny. Sprinkle batter with coconut flakes and chocolate chips; mix well.
2. Grease a skillet with olive oil spray and place over medium-high heat. Fry banana slices until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Flip banana slices, add a drop of honey onto each one, and cook until caramelized, about 3 minutes. Transfer banana slices to a plate, keeping 3 in the skillet.
3. Drop a large spoonful of batter over the banana slices in the same skillet. Cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining banana slices and batter.
