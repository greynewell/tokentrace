## Ingredients

- 4 ounces thinly sliced pancetta
- ⅓ cup Calabrian chili peppers in oil
- 12 ounces sliced salami
- 2 tablespoons olive oil, or more as needed
- ¼ cup butter, at room temperature

## Instructions

1. Add pancetta to a cold pan. Cook over medium heat, tossing occasionally, until pancetta just starts to crisp up, 4 to 5 minutes.
2. Remove pepper stems and, if desired, seeds. Reserve 2 or 3 tablespoons of the oil.
3. Separate salami pieces slightly and place in a food processor. Add the pancetta, chili oil, and Calabrian peppers. Pulse on and off until mixture is finely ground. Add olive oil and butter. Process until as smooth and spreadable as desired.
4. Transfer spread to a bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight, for best flavor.
