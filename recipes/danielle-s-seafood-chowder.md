- ⅓ cup butter
- 1 teaspoon olive oil
- 1  onion, minced
- ⅓ cup all-purpose flour
- 1 quart half-and-half, or as needed
- 2 cups bar clams, drained with juice reserved
- ⅓ cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
- 2  potatoes, cubed
- 2 cups cream-style corn
- 1 large ear corn, kernels cut from the cob

## Instructions

1. Melt butter with olive oil in a large pot over medium-low heat; stir in onion and sauté until translucent, about 5 minutes. Whisk flour into butter mixture; whisk in half-and-half and juice from drained clams.
