## Ingredients

- 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- ½ cup white sugar
- 4 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 pinch salt
- ½ cup butter
- 3 tablespoons butter
- 1  egg
- 1  egg yolk
- 2 cups milk
- 2  eggs
- ⅓ cup white sugar
- 6 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1  (2-inch) strip of lemon zest
- 7  pitted fresh cherries, or more to taste
- 2  fresh peaches - peeled, pitted, and sliced
- 2 large kiwis, peeled and sliced

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Whisk flour, sugar, cocoa powder, and salt together in a bowl. Cut in 1/2 cup plus 3 tablespoons butter using a pastry cutter or 2 knives until mixture resembles coarse meal. Mix in egg and egg yolk until dough comes together.
3. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured work surface. Transfer to a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until dry to the touch, about 25 minutes.
5. Meanwhile, prepare the pastry cream. Bring milk to a simmer in a medium saucepan.
6. Whisk eggs, sugar, and flour together in a large bowl until smooth. Whisk in hot milk, a little at a time, until custard is smooth. Pour custard back into the saucepan; add lemon zest. Cook, whisking constantly, until pastry cream thickens and comes to a boil, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat, discard lemon zest, and let cool.
7. Remove tart crust from the oven and let cool to room temperature, about 20 minutes.
8. Unmold crust and fill with cooled pastry cream. Pile cherries in the center. Arrange peach slices in a ring around the cherries. Arrange kiwi slices in a ring around the peaches.
