## Ingredients

- 4 tablespoons butter
- 2 teaspoons olive oil
- 1 ½ teaspoons garlic powder
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 6 medium potatoes, scrubbed

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Place butter in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave on high until melted, 20 to 30 seconds. Stir in olive oil, garlic powder, salt, and pepper.
3. Use a fork to poke about 5 holes into each potato. Place each potato on a sheet of aluminum foil about 6 inches wide. Brush butter mixture over potatoes, making sure to evenly coat each one. Wrap up completely in foil. Poke 5 more holes into the wrapped potatoes.
4. Bake potatoes in the center of the preheated oven until easily pierced with a fork, about 1 hour. Spread leftover butter mixture over potatoes after cutting them open.
