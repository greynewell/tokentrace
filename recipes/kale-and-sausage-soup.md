## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons butter
- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 4 cups chicken broth
- 2 cups water, or more as needed
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 5 cloves garlic, minced
- 5 sprigs fresh thyme
- 3  bay leaves
- 1 tablespoon dried sage, or more to taste
- 1 pound ground hot Italian sausage
- 4  red potatoes, or more to taste, chopped
- 1 large bunch kale, stems removed and chopped
- 1 pound fresh mushrooms, quartered
- 1 cup half-and-half
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Melt butter in a stockpot over medium-low heat. Whisk in flour and stir until the mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown, about 3 minutes. Gradually whisk chicken broth and water into the roux, and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Add onion, garlic, thyme, bay leaves, and sage; cook until the mixture has thickened onions are tender, 10 to 15 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer sausage to a paper towel-lined plate to remove excess grease.
3. Add sausage, potatoes, kale, and mushrooms to the stockpot. Simmer until potatoes are tender, about 45 minutes. Add half-and-half and season with salt and pepper.
