## Ingredients

- ½ cup light beer
- ⅓ cup prepared yellow mustard
- 2 cloves garlic, chopped
- ½ teaspoon red pepper flakes
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon black pepper
- 2 pounds chicken drumsticks

## Instructions

1. Combine beer, mustard, garlic, pepper flakes, salt, and pepper in a 1-gallon resealable plastic bag. Add chicken drumsticks; turn to coat evenly. Seal bag, squeezing out all the air.
2. Let chicken marinate in the refrigerator, at least 2 hours and preferably overnight.
3. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place drumsticks and sauce into a baking dish, discarding the plastic bag.
4. Transfer drumsticks and marinade to a baking dish and cover with aluminum foil.
5. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Check chicken and remove cover if desired. Continue to bake until chicken is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 15 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
