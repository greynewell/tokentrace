## Ingredients

- 2 ½ cups fresh blueberries
- 1 ½ tablespoons cake flour
- 3 ¼ cups cake flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 cups white sugar
- 1 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 2  lemons, or more to taste, zested
- 3 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon lemon extract
- ¼ cup buttermilk
- 1 cup powdered sugar
- 1  lemon, zested and juiced
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled
- salt

## Instructions

1. Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a fluted tube pan (such as Bundt®).
2. Place blueberries in a bowl and sprinkle with 1 1/2 tablespoons flour; toss until berries are completely coated. Sift together 3 1/4 cups flour, baking soda, and salt into a separate bowl.
3. Combine sugar, softened butter, and lemon zest in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add eggs, 1 at a time, and lemon extract, beating well after each addition until smooth. Add flour mixture and buttermilk; mix until well combined. Gently fold in floured blueberries and pour batter into the prepared pan, smoothing it out with a spatula.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 50 to 60 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Run a table knife around the edges to loosen. Invert carefully onto a serving plate or cooling rack.
5. While cake is cooling, combine powdered sugar and lemon zest in the bowl of a food processor; process until zest is finely processed and blended with sugar. Add lemon juice, melted butter, and salt and blend until smooth. Apply glaze to the warm cake with a pastry brush. Allow to cool before slicing.
