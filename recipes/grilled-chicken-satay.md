## Ingredients

- 20 wooden skewers
- 6 each boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut lengthwise into strips
- 6 tablespoons soy sauce
- 6 tablespoons tomato sauce
- 2 tablespoons peanut oil
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 tablespoon peanut oil
- ¼  onion, finely chopped
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 8 tablespoons peanut butter
- 3 tablespoons white sugar
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 cup water
- ½  lemon, juiced

## Instructions

1. Put wooden skewers in a shallow dish and cover with water. Let soak for 20 minutes.
2. Place chicken strips into a bowl. Combine soy sauce, tomato sauce, peanut oil, garlic, pepper, and cumin in a small bowl; mix to combine. Pour over chicken strips and mix so chicken is well coated on all sides. Marinate for 15 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, make the peanut sauce. Add 1 tablespoon oil to a hot skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic. Cook and stir until onion is soft and translucent, about 4 minutes. Add peanut butter, sugar, soy sauce, and water. Mix well. Cook until sauce has thickened slightly, about 5 minutes. Add lemon juice and remove from heat.
4. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Thread each chicken strip onto a skewer.
5. Place skewers on the preheated grill and cook for a total of 10 minutes, flipping once halfway through cooking. Serve the satay skewers immediately with the peanut sauce for dipping.
