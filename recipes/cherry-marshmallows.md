## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon butter
- ⅓ cup powdered sugar, divided
- 1 cup cold water, divided
- 2 (1 ounce) packages unflavored gelatin (such as Knox®)
- 1 ½ cups white sugar
- 1 cup light corn syrup
- 1 (0.3 ounce) package sugar-free cherry-flavored gelatin mix (such as Jell-O®)
- 1 teaspoon almond extract

## Instructions

1. Generously butter the bottom and sides of an 11x7-inch glass baking dish and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon powdered sugar.
2. Add 1/2 cup cold water to the bowl of a stand mixer and add unflavored gelatin. Set aside to soften.
3. Combine remaining 1/2 cup water, white sugar, corn syrup, cherry gelatin, and almond extract in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir constantly until sugar and gelatin are dissolved. Heat the mixture to boiling, then reduce heat to medium-low. Cook, without stirring, until a candy thermometer immersed in the mixture reads 240 degrees F (115 degrees C), about 30 minutes. Watch carefully that syrup doesn't boil over; reduce heat if necessary.
4. Slowly pour syrup into the softened gelatin in the stand mixer bowl. Beat on low speed, then increase to medium-high and beat until marshmallow mixture has tripled in size. Pour into the prepared baking dish and smooth the top using a rubber spatula. Set marshmallow mixture aside and let stand, uncovered, 8 hours to overnight.
5. Dust a large cutting board with about 1 tablespoon powdered sugar. Loosen sides of marshmallow mixture from the baking dish, lift out onto the cutting board, and rub additional powdered sugar on top. Spray a sharp knife with cooking spray and cut marshmallows into 1-inch squares, 11 rows by 7 rows.
6. Toss marshmallows in a large bowl with remaining powdered sugar. Shake off excess sugar and transfer marshmallows to an airtight container.
