## Ingredients

- 3 ¾ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ teaspoons baking powder
- 1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt
- 1 ¼ teaspoons baking soda
- 1 ¼ cups unsalted butter, softened
- 1 ¼ cups white sugar
- 1 cup light brown sugar
- 2 large eggs, at room temperature
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 (12 ounce) package semisweet chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. Whisk flour, baking powder, salt, and baking soda together in a medium bowl, and set aside.
2. Beat butter and sugars together in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add eggs one at a time, scraping down sides of bowl as necessary. Beat for an additional 3 minutes. Add vanilla and beat for 10 seconds.
3. Reduce speed to low and gradually add in the flour mixture, blending just until combined. Fold in chocolate chips.
4. Scoop 1 1/2-inch balls of dough 3 inches apart onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet; freeze for 15 minutes.
5. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (225 degrees C).
6. Bake cookies in the preheated oven, rotating halfway through, until golden around the edges and slightly gooey inside, about 8 minutes. Let stand on the baking sheet for 4 to 5 minutes, then transfer to a cooling rack.
