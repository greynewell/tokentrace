## Ingredients

- 1 (3 pound) spaghetti squash
- 1 teaspoon olive oil
- ¼ teaspoon sea salt
- ⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ⅛ teaspoon smoked paprika

## Instructions

1. Using a sharp knife, make a dotted line lengthwise around the entire squash. Place whole squash in the microwave and cook on full power for 5 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and cut the squash in half lengthwise, using the dotted line as a guide. Wrap one half in plastic wrap and refrigerate for another use.
2. Spoon pulp and seeds out of remaining half and discard. Brush olive oil over all of the flesh and sprinkle with salt, pepper, and paprika.
3. Preheat an air fryer to 360 degrees F (180 degrees C). Place spaghetti squash half skin side-down in the basket. Cook for 20 minutes.
4. Transfer to a dish and fluff with a fork to create 'noodles'.
