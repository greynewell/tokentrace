## Ingredients

- 1 pound dried red kidney beans, rinsed
- 2 quarts water
- 1  Moroccan-style preserved lemon, or to taste
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1  small red chile pepper, halved lengthwise
- 1  bay leaf
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon anise seed

## Instructions

1. Place kidney beans into a large container and cover with about 1 quart water; let stand 8 hours to overnight. Drain.
2. Combine beans, 1 quart water, preserved lemon, sugar, black pepper, red chile pepper, bay leaf, garlic powder, and anise seed in a stockpot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover stockpot, and simmer for 1 hour.
