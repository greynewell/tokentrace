## Ingredients

- 1 ½ pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 ½ tablespoons olive oil, divided
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic
- 2 teaspoons dried thyme
- 1 teaspoon dried rosemary
- ½ cup chicken broth
- ⅓ cup oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, drained and cut into strips
- 1 cup heavy cream
- ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Season chicken thighs with salt and pepper.
2. Set an oven-proof skillet on high heat. When hot, add 1 tablespoon oil and chicken. Cook until well seared, about 3 minutes per side. Remove chicken to a plate and reduce heat to medium.
3. Add remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil, then add garlic, thyme, and rosemary. Bloom spices together for 1 minute. Pour in chicken broth, then add sun-dried tomatoes, and finally the cream. Stir well and then blend in Parmesan cheese. Bring to a light simmer. Add chicken back to the pan.
4. Transfer to the preheated oven and bake, uncovered, until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
5. Remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly to let the sauce thicken before serving, about 5 minutes.
