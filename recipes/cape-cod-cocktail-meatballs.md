## Ingredients

- 2 pounds ground beef
- 1 cup bread crumbs
- ¼ cup chopped fresh parsley
- 2  eggs
- 2 tablespoons grated onion
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- ¼ teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 (16 ounce) can jellied cranberry sauce (such as Ocean Spray®)
- 1 ½ cups ketchup
- 2 ½ tablespoons packed brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Mix ground beef, bread crumbs, parsley, eggs, grated onion, soy sauce, and garlic powder in a bowl until thoroughly combined. Pinch off about 2 teaspoons of meat mixture per meatball and roll into small meatballs. Arrange meatballs in a large, deep baking dish.
