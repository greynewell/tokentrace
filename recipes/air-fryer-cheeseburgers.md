## Ingredients

- 1 slice white sandwich bread
- 1 ½ tablespoons low-fat milk
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 pound ground beef
- 2 slices Cheddar cheese
- 2  brioche buns, halved

## Instructions

1. Preheat the air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Cut crust off sandwich bread and tear bread into small pieces. Mix with milk, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a bowl until well incorporated. Add ground beef and mix well. Shape into 2 equal patties. Make an indentation in the center of each patty with your thumb; this prevents them from puffing up.
3. Place in the air fryer basket and cook for 8 to 10 minutes. Flip patties over and continue cooking on the second side, 8 to 10 minutes more. Top each patty with cheese and place back in the air fryer until cheese has started to melt, 20 to 30 seconds. Place on buns.
