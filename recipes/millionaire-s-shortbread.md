## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- ½ cup butter, cut into small pieces
- 3 tablespoons brown sugar
- 1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
- 4 tablespoons butter
- 3 tablespoons brown sugar
- 6 ounces milk chocolate, chopped

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch square pan.
2. Sift flour into a bowl. Rub in butter with your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine bread crumbs. Mix in brown sugar and shape dough into a ball.
3. Press dough into the prepared pan. Prick all over with a fork.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until set and golden brown, about 20 minutes. Let cool.
5. Meanwhile, combine condensed milk, butter, and brown sugar in a nonstick saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until caramel comes to a boil. Reduce heat and cook until golden and pulling away from the sides of the pan, 4 to 5 minutes.
6. Pour caramel over cooled crust and refrigerate until firm to the touch, about 1 hour.
7. Place chocolate in top of a double boiler over simmering water. Stir frequently, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, until chocolate is melted, about 5 minutes.
8. Spread melted chocolate over cooled caramel. Refrigerate until chocolate hardens, about 15 minutes. Cut into bars.
