## Ingredients

- 1 ¼ cups white sugar
- ¾ cup salted butter, softened
- ¼ cup vegetable oil
- 3  egg yolks

- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease 2 cookie sheets and set aside.
2. Beat 1 1/4 cups sugar, butter, and oil together until creamy. Beat in the egg yolks, lemon zest, and vanilla.
