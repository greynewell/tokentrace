## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 cup coarsely chopped onion
- ½ cup diced celery
- ¾ cup chopped green bell pepper
- ¾ cup chopped red bell pepper
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1 pound andouille sausage, diced
- 3 cups frozen corn kernels, thawed
- 2  bay leaves
- 2 teaspoons dried thyme
- 6 cups low-sodium chicken broth
- 3  Yukon Gold potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
- 1 cup heavy cream
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir onion, celery, green bell pepper, and red bell pepper in the hot oil until softened, about 5 minutes.
2. Stir garlic, cayenne pepper, and diced andouille sausage into the onion mixture; continue to cook and stir until the sausage is hot, 1 to 2 minutes more.
