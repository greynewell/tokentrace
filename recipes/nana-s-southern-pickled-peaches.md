## Ingredients

- 4 cups sugar
- 1 cup white vinegar
- 1 cup water
- 2 tablespoons whole cloves
- 4 pounds fresh clingstone peaches, blanched and peeled
- 5 (3 inch) cinnamon sticks

## Instructions

1. Inspect 5 quart-sized jars for cracks and rings for rust, discarding any defective ones. Immerse in simmering water until peaches are ready. Wash new, unused lids and rings in warm soapy water.
2. At the same time, combine sugar, vinegar and water in a large pot, bring to a boil. Boil until syrupy, about 5 minutes.
3. While the sugar mixture is boiling, press 1 to 2 cloves into each peach.
4. Place peaches into the boiling syrup. Boil until peaches are tender, about 20 minutes.
5. Spoon peaches into hot, sterilized jars, and top with liquid, filling to within 1/2 inch of the rim. Insert a cinnamon stick in each jar. Wipe the rims with a clean dry cloth, and seal with lids and rings.
6. Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars 2 inches apart into the boiling water using a holder. Pour in more boiling water to cover jars by at least 1 inch. Bring to a rolling boil, cover, and process for 10 minutes to seal, or consult times recommended by your local extension.
7. Remove the jars from the stockpot and let rest, several inches apart, for 12 to 24 hours. Press the center of each lid with a finger to ensure the lid does not move up or down. Remove the rings for storage and store in a cool, dark area.
