## Ingredients

- 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
- ¾ cup butter
- 4 cups vanilla wafer crumbs (such as Nilla®)
- 1 ½ cups confectioners' sugar
- 1 cup finely chopped pecans
- ⅓ cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- ¼ cup ground almonds
- ¾ cup Irish cream liqueur (such as Baileys®)
- ½ cup sour cream
- 1 ½ pounds dark chocolate, chopped, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Place chocolate chips and butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat; stir until melted and smooth, about 5 minutes.
2. Remove from heat to cool slightly.
3. Whisk vanilla wafer crumbs, confectioner's sugar, pecans, cocoa powder, and almonds together in a large bowl; stir in Irish cream liqueur, sour cream, and chocolate mixture to form a soft dough.
4. Cover mixture with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.
5. Form mixture into balls using a tablespoon-size cookie scoop; place on a baking sheet.
6. Place baking sheet in the freezer until firm, about 30 minutes.
7. Melt dark chocolate in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring after each melting, for 1 to 3 minutes (depending on your microwave).
8. Do not overheat or chocolate will scorch.
9. Using a toothpick, dip each ball into melted chocolate to coat; place on waxed paper until chocolate is firm, about 10 minutes.
10. Place balls in candy cups; store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 6 weeks.
