## Ingredients

- ¼ cup raisins
- ¼ cup rum
- 1 cup whole milk
- 5  eggs
- ¼ cup white sugar
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- salt
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 tablespoon butter, melted
- ¼ cup confectioners' sugar, plus more for dusting
- plum preserves for serving

## Instructions

1. In a small bowl, combine raisins with rum and let soak 30 minutes then drain.
2. In a medium mixing bowl, beat together the milk, eggs, white sugar, vanilla, and salt. Gradually whisk in the flour to make a smooth batter. Stir in the drained raisins.
3. In a large skillet melt 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat. Pour the batter into the skillet and cook 5 to 6 minutes, or until the pancake has set and the bottom is golden brown. Turn over the pancake and cook 3 minutes, or until this side is also golden brown. Using a spatula or two forks, tear the pancake into bite-size pieces. Drizzle in the melted butter and sprinkle with confectioners' sugar. Turn up the heat to medium high and use a spatula to gently toss the pieces for 5 minutes, or until the sugar has caramelized. Sprinkle with additional confectioners' sugar and serve with plum preserves.
