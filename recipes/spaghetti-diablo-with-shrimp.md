## Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon olive oil
- 1  green bell pepper, chopped
- 1  yellow bell pepper, chopped
- 1  onion, chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 2 (14.5 ounce) cans no-salt-added diced tomatoes
- ½ cup white wine
- ½ cup chopped fresh parsley, divided
- ½ teaspoon dried basil
- ½ teaspoon dried oregano
- ½ teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 8 ounces whole-wheat spaghetti
- 12 ounces cooked shrimp
- ½ cup grated Pecorino-Romano cheese, or to taste  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Cook and stir green bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, onion, and garlic in hot oil until tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Season mixture with salt and pepper.
2. Stir tomatoes, wine, 1/4 cup parsley, basil, oregano, and red pepper flakes into bell pepper mixture; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and put a cover on the Dutch oven. Cook, occasionally stirring, until tomatoes break down, about 2 hours.
