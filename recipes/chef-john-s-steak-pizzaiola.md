## Ingredients

- 1 pound beef tenderloin steaks, cut into 4 medallions
- salt and pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
- 2 teaspoons butter
- 1 pinch salt
- 1 cup sliced sweet and hot peppers
- 4 cloves garlic, crushed
- ½ cup white wine
- ¼ teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 cup tomato concasse (see footnote for recipe link)
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano
- 1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar
- 1 pinch red pepper flakes
- 1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Season steak medallions with salt and black pepper on both sides.
2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add steaks and cook until browned, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate. Reserve oil in skillet.
3. Place mushrooms and butter into the skillet and season with salt; cook and stir until mushrooms are softened and beginning to brown, 5 to 6 minutes. Reduce heat to medium; add peppers and cook and stir until softened, about 2 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook for 1 minute. Pour in wine and sprinkle in dried oregano. Increase heat to medium-high and cook until the wine is nearly evaporated, about 3 minutes.
4. Stir tomato concasse into the mushroom mixture and simmer until tomato is softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Add fresh oregano, balsamic vinegar, and red pepper flakes; stir to combine. Adjust salt and black pepper to taste.
5. Place steaks back into the skillet with the mushroom mixture and cook until warmed through and cooked to desired doneness, 4 to 10 minutes.
