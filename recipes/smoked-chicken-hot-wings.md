## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon kosher salt
- 1 ½ teaspoons ground black pepper
- 1 ½ teaspoons Cajun seasoning
- 2 ½ pounds chicken wings
- ⅔ cup hot pepper sauce (such as Frank's RedHot®)
- ½ cup butter
- 1 ½ tablespoons white vinegar
- ½ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
- ⅛ teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 pinch salt to taste

## Instructions

1. Heat a smoker to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C) according to the manufacturer's directions.
2. To make the dry rub: Mix 1 tablespoon salt, pepper, and Cajun seasoning in a small bowl; sprinkle over chicken wings.
3. Place chicken wings, unstacked, onto wire racks. Place the racks into the smoker. Add wood chips according to the manufacturer's directions; smoke chicken wings in the preheated smoker for 1 hour.
4. To make the sauce: Combine hot pepper sauce, butter, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, and salt in a small saucepan over low heat. Cook, stirring often, until butter is melted and sauce is smooth; set aside.
5. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Transfer smoked wings to a large bowl; stir in 1/2 of the sauce until wings are evenly coated.
6. Cook wings on the preheated grill until skin is browned and crispy, about 4 to 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Transfer to a large bowl and stir in remaining sauce until wings are well coated.
