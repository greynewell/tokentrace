## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 2 (16 ounce) packages frozen shrimp (41 to 60 per pound) - thawed, peeled, and tails left on
- 4  eggs
- 4 cups all-purpose flour
- ½ cup Italian bread crumbs
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ teaspoon cornstarch
- canola oil for frying
- 1 cup buttery spread (such as Smart Balance®)
- ½ cup cayenne pepper sauce (such as Frank's® RedHot®), or to taste
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 tablespoon corn syrup, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Grease 2 baking sheets with cooking spray.
2. Run a sharp knife along each shrimp's back and open slightly. Place shrimp in a large bowl of cold water.
3. Whisk eggs in a large bowl until smooth. Drain shrimp and add to egg mixture; mix with your hands to combine and coat.
4. Mix flour, bread crumbs, salt, pepper, and cornstarch together in a large bowl. Dredge shrimp, a few at a time, in flour until well-coated, including the opening in the backs. Place battered shrimp on baking sheets.
5. Chill shrimp until batter is set, about 30 minutes.
6. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan.
7. Fry shrimp, in batches, until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes per batch. Test one to make sure shrimp is cooked through. Transfer to paper towel-lined bowl to drain.
8. Place buttery spread, cayenne pepper sauce, and garlic powder in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Heat until sauce is combined; stir in corn syrup.
9. Divide shrimp among serving bowls. Stir in sauce until shrimp are completely covered.
