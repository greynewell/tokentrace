## Ingredients

- ⅓ cup honey
- ¾ cup soy sauce
- ¼ cup Sriracha
- 2 medium limes, juiced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided
- ½ medium red onion, chopped
- 5 cloves garlic, minced
- ¾ pound fresh green beans, trimmed and cut into desired length
- 4 small potatoes, cubed
- 1 pint cherry tomatoes, halved
- 1 medium yellow bell pepper, chopped
- 1 medium lime, juiced
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- ¼ cup Sriracha
- ¼ cup brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons honey
- 1 medium jalapeno pepper, seeded and diced
- 1 stalk green onion, chopped, or more to taste

## Instructions

1. Whisk honey, soy sauce, Sriracha, lime juice, garlic, and pepper for marinade together in a bowl and pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add chicken thighs, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator, turning halfway through, for 2 hours.
2. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
3. Remove chicken from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade.
4. Melt butter in a large, cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken, skin-side down, and sear until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes; this will melt out most of the fat underneath and leave a nice, crispy skin. Flip over and grill for 2 more minutes. Remove chicken to a plate.
5. Drain extra fat and oil from the skillet. Add remaining 1 tablespoon butter and let melt. Add onion and garlic to the melted butter and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Mix in green beans, potatoes, cherry tomatoes, bell pepper, lime juice, salt, and pepper. Cook, mixing carefully, for 5 minutes.
6. Meanwhile, mix Sriracha, brown sugar, honey, and jalapeno in a small bowl until smooth.
7. Remove skillet from the heat. Return chicken to the skillet, skin-side up. Pour Sriracha mixture primarily onto the chicken, and a bit onto the vegetables.
8. Place the skillet in the preheated oven and roast until potatoes are tender and chicken is completely cooked through, 30 to 35 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
9. Garnish with green onion and serve.
