## Ingredients

- 2 (4 ounce) boneless cod fillets
- 2 large potatoes, peeled and sliced
- 1 medium onion, thinly sliced
- 2 cups milk, or as needed
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon salted butter, cut into small pieces

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a large, rectangular baking dish.
2. Place the fish in the prepared dish. Arrange potato and onion slices around and on top. Pour enough milk over top to just barely cover. Season with a generous amount of salt and pepper. Dot butter over top.
3. Bake, uncovered, in the preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork and potatoes are tender, about 45 minutes, checking frequently and adding more milk if necessary. Serve in large bowls.
