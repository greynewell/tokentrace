## Ingredients

- 1 cup Italian-style salad dressing
- ½ cup Worcestershire sauce
- ½ cup applesauce
- ¼ cup hot pepper sauce
- 1  lime, juiced
- 6  bone-in pork chops

## Instructions

1. Mix together the Italian dressing, Worcestershire sauce, applesauce, hot pepper sauce, and lime juice in a bowl. Pour the marinade over the pork chops, and refrigerate in marinade for 6 hours or overnight.
2. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate.
3. Remove the chops from the marinade, and pour marinade into a saucepan. Bring the marinade to a boil over medium heat, and allow to boil for about 1 minute. Place the pork chops onto the preheated grill, and grill until well browned and no longer pink in the middle, about 6 minutes per side, basting the chops occasionally with the marinade. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Allow the marinade baste to cook completely onto the chops.
