## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups white sugar
- ½ cup butter
- ¼ cup vegetable oil
- 3  eggs
- 1 (8 ounce) can crushed pineapple, well drained
- ¾ cup milk
- ¼ cup brandy, or as needed, divided
- 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 2 ½ teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon brandy
- 1 (15 ounce) can cream of coconut
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 35 cupcake cups with paper liners.
2. Beat sugar, butter, and oil together in a bowl with an electric mixer until creamy and fluffy. Beat in eggs one at a time. Stir in pineapple, milk, and 1/4 cup brandy.
3. Sift flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in another bowl. Add slowly to the sugar mixture, beating with an electric hand mixer to get a light, fluffy batter.
4. Spoon batter into the cupcake liners, leaving about 1/8 inch of each liner free (this cake doesn't rise a lot).
5. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean, about 17 minutes.
6. Remove from the oven and immediately spoon 1 teaspoon of brandy over the top of each cupcake; let seep into the cake. Let cool completely.
7. Beat cream of coconut and cream cheese together with an electric mixer until it is lump-free. Frost cooled cupcakes.
