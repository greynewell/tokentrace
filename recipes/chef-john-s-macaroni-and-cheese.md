## Ingredients

- 1 (16 ounce) package elbow macaroni
- ¼ cup butter
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- ¼ teaspoon dried thyme
- ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- ⅛ teaspoon white pepper
- 3 cups milk
- 1 pinch ground nutmeg
- ¼ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 3 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese, divided
- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- ½ cup panko bread crumbs
- 1 tablespoon butter, melted

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and set aside.
3. Melt 1/4 cup butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. When butter starts to foam and bubble, stir in flour; cook on medium heat until flour begins to turn pale yellow, 3 to 4 minutes. Add thyme, cayenne, and white pepper; cook and stir another minute, then whisk in 1 cup milk until smooth. Pour in remaining milk and whisk again. Bring sauce just to a simmer.
4. Stir in salt, Worcestershire sauce, and nutmeg. Simmer, whisking often, on medium-low heat until thickened, about 8 minutes.
5. Turn heat off, then add 2 1/4 cups Cheddar cheese; stir until melted and combined. Mix in Dijon mustard.
6. Transfer macaroni into a casserole dish, then pour in cheese sauce; stir to thoroughly combine pasta with sauce.
7. Mix together panko bread crumbs and 1 tablespoon melted butter in a small bowl. Sprinkle mixture over macaroni and cheese. Sprinkle remaining 3/4 cup Cheddar cheese on top.
8. Bake in the preheated oven until top is golden brown, about 20 minutes.
