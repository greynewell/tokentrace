## Ingredients

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon baking soda
- ¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¾ cup milk
- 1 large egg
- 1 tablespoon melted unsalted butter
- 1 teaspoon amaretto extract
- 1 pint strawberries, sliced horizontally
- 1/4 cup blueberry cream cheese spread (such as Philadelphia®)
- 1 medium banana, sliced
- 1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar, or to taste
- 10 bamboo skewers, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt in a bowl. Whisk milk, egg, butter, and amaretto extract together in a second bowl. Pour wet ingredients into the flour mixture, and mix until batter is well combined and smooth.
2. Heat a large nonstick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Drop teaspoonfuls of batter onto the hot skillet to form 1-inch diameter pancakes. Cook for about 1 to 2 minutes, flip, and continue cooking until golden brown, about 1 more minute. Transfer cooked pancakes to a plate and repeat with remaining batter.
3. Stack ingredients on a work surface as follows: pancake, banana, pancake spread with cream cheese, pancake, strawberry, and pancake. (Each skewer will use 4 pancakes.) Insert a skewer through the center of the stack and repeat to make remaining skewers.
4. Dust with confectioners sugar, and serve.
