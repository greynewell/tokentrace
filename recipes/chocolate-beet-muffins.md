## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ⅔ cup white sugar
- 6 tablespoons butter, softened
- ¾ teaspoon lemon zest
- 2  eggs, at room temperature
- 1  ripe banana, mashed
- 1 cup finely chopped cooked beets
- 1 cup chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 12 muffin cups with paper liners.
2. Mix flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl.
3. Beat sugar, butter, and lemon zest together in a large bowl until smooth. Add eggs and banana to the sugar mixture; beat until smooth. Stir about 1/3 of the flour mixture into the sugar mixture to integrate fully into a batter; repeat with remaining flour mixture in two even additions. Fold beets and chocolate chips into the batter; spoon into the lined muffin cups.
