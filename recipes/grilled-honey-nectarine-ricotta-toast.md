## Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon olive oil
- 1 large nectarine, pitted and cut into 8 wedges
- 2 thick slices crusty bread
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- ¼ cup whole-milk ricotta cheese
- 1 tablespoon crushed sliced almonds
- 2 leaves fresh mint, minced
- 2 teaspoons honey, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil grate.
2. Drizzle 1 teaspoon olive oil onto a small plate. Place nectarine wedges on the plate and cover all sides with oil. Brush both sides of bread with 2 tablespoons olive oil.
3. Place nectarines onto the hot grate and grill 1 to 2 minutes per side; remove to a plate. When nectarine wedges have cooled slightly, cut each wedge in 1/2 lengthwise so you now have 16 pieces.
4. Place bread slices onto the hot grate and cook until grill marks appear and bread is toasted, about 1 minute per side; remove to a plate.
5. Spread ricotta cheese onto each slice of toast. Arrange 8 nectarine slices onto each toast and top with almonds. Sprinkle with mint and drizzle with honey. Cut each toast in half and serve.
