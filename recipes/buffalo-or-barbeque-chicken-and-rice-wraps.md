## Ingredients

- 1 cup UNCLE BEN'S® Ready Rice® Whole Grain Brown
- 1 cup shredded cooked chicken breast
- ¼ cup Buffalo-style hot pepper sauce (such as Frank's® Red Hot®)
- ½ cup shredded Cheddar cheese
- ½ cup shredded lettuce
- 4 (8 inch) whole-wheat tortillas
- 1 cup baby carrots
- 1 cup celery sticks
- 1 cup reduced fat ranch dressing, divided

## Instructions

1. Gently squeeze the sides of rice pouch to break apart rice. Pour rice and water into a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir until rice is heated through and water is absorbed, about 2 minutes. Set aside.
2. Combine shredded chicken and buffalo sauce in a bowl; stir well and set aside.
3. Place a tortilla on a microwave-safe plate covered with a damp paper towel. Cook on high until warm and pliable, 20 to 30 seconds. Repeat this step with remaining tortillas.
4. Evenly divide rice among tortillas and spread to within 1/2 inch of the edges. Evenly divide chicken mixture over rice. Sprinkle with cheese, then top with lettuce. Fold in the sides of each tortilla and roll up tightly. Cut each wrap in half, diagonally.
5. Serve each wrap with carrots, celery, and about 1/4 cup ranch dressing for dipping.
