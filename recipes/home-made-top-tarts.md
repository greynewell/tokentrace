## Ingredients

- 1 (15 ounce) package refrigerated pie crusts
- ¼ cup strawberry jam, divided
- 2 cups confectioners' sugar
- 2 tablespoons milk
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 tablespoon colored decorating sugar, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
2. Unroll pie crusts, place on a lightly floured work surface, and roll slightly with a rolling pin to square the edges. Cut each crust into 8 equal-sized rectangles.
3. Place about 2 teaspoons strawberry jam in the center of 8 squares. Spread jam out to within 1/4-inch of the edge. Top each with another pastry square and use a fork to crimp together, sealing in jam. Use a knife to trim pastries, if desired. Transfer filled pastries to the prepared baking sheets.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until edges are lightly golden brown, about 7 minutes. Allow to cool on the baking sheets.
5. Stir together confectioners' sugar, milk, and vanilla extract in a bowl to make a spreadable frosting. Spread cooled tarts with frosting and sprinkle with colored sugar.
