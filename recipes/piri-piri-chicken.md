## Ingredients

- 10  African bird's eye chile peppers
- 1 bunch cilantro
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 2 teaspoons white vinegar
- 2  limes, juiced
- 1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
- 1 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper, or to taste
- 1  chicken breast, cut in half
- 2  chicken leg quarters with skin

## Instructions

1. Use rubber gloves to mince chiles and place them into a mixing bowl. Add cilantro, garlic, vegetable oil, vinegar, lime juice, salt, and black pepper. Mix piri piri sauce well.
2. Place chicken breasts and legs into a resealable plastic bag. Pour in piri piri sauce, seal the bag, and shake gently to cover chicken completely. Put the bag in the refrigerator to marinate for at least 4 hours.
3. Remove the bag from the refrigerator about 30 minutes before cooking to allow chicken to come to room temperature.
4. Preheat an outdoor grill to medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
5. Remove chicken from the bag; discard bag and cilantro. Cook chicken on the preheated grill, rotating as necessary to cook evenly, until juices run clear and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 25 minutes.
