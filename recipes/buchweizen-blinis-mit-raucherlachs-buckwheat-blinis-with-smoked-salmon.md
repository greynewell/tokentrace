## Ingredients

- ½ teaspoon active dry yeast
- 1 cup warm milk
- ½ cup buckwheat flour
- ½ teaspoon white sugar
- ¾ cup all-purpose flour
- 2  eggs, beaten
- ¼ cup heavy whipping cream
- 2 tablespoons sour cream
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, divided, or as needed
- 4 ounces smoked salmon, cut into thin strips
- 4 ounces sour cream
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill

## Instructions

1. Dissolve yeast in warm milk in a bowl.
2. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.
3. Stir in buckwheat flour and sugar; cover with a towel.
4. Let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
5. Whisk all-purpose flour, eggs, heavy whipping cream, sour cream, and salt into buckwheat mixture until smooth batter forms.
6. Cover with a towel and let stand until batter is frothy and doubled in volume again, about 2 hours.
7. Heat 1 teaspoon vegetable oil in a non-stick skillet over high heat.
8. Drop batter by tablespoonfuls onto skillet; cook until small bubbles rise to the top and edges are dry, about 2 minutes.
9. Flip and cook until evenly browned on other side, about 2 minutes more.
10. Repeat with remaining batter.
11. Top each blini with 1 salmon strip, a teaspoon-sized dollop of sour cream, and a sprinkle of dill.
