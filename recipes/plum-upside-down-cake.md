## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar, or to taste
- 1 ½ tablespoons blanched almond flour
- 3  plums, pitted and sliced
- ½ cup unsalted butter, softened
- ½ cup white sugar
- 1  egg, at room temperature
- ¾ teaspoon vanilla extract, or to taste
- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 cup milk, at room temperature

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Drop butter into an 8-inch square and let melt in the preheating oven.
2. Remove the pan from the oven and tilt to coat the bottom evenly with butter. Sprinkle brown sugar and almond flour on top. Arrange plum slices over the mixture.
3. Beat softened butter and sugar together until light and creamy. Mix in egg and vanilla extract until fluffy.
4. Sift flour, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon together in a separate bowl. Add to the butter mixture alternately with the milk, folding just until dry spots disappear. Pour batter evenly over the plums; tap pan onto the counter to expel excess air bubbles.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes.
6. Cover the pan with a serving plate and immediately invert cake onto the plate. Let cool until no longer hot, about 15 minutes. Cut and serve warm.
