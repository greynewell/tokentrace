## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons paprika
- 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 1 ½ tablespoons brown sugar
- ¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ⅛ teaspoon ground cloves
- ⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 5 pounds pork spareribs
- 2 pounds hickory wood chips, soaked

## Instructions

1. In a medium bowl, stir together paprika, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, ground black pepper, cumin, brown sugar, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg. Apply liberally to the ribs. Place ribs in a large roasting pan, cover, and refrigerate overnight. Remove ribs from the refrigerator 1 hour before smoking.
2. Prepare an outdoor smoker, bringing the temperature to 200 to 225 degrees F (95 to 110 degrees C).
