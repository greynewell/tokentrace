## Ingredients

- 2 cups rolled oats
- ½ cup shredded coconut
- ½ cup honey
- 2 tablespoons creamy peanut butter
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ⅛ teaspoon salt

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch square baking dish. Spread oats and coconut evenly across a baking sheet.
2. Toast oats and coconut in the preheated oven until browned, about 10 minutes; transfer to a large mixing bowl.
3. Mix honey, peanut butter, vanilla extract, and salt in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook and stir until smooth. Pour honey mixture over oats and coconut; stir to coat; spread mixture evenly into the prepared baking dish.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until beginning to dry, about 15 minutes for crunchy granola bars, less if you like them chewy. Cool completely before cutting.
