## Ingredients

- 1 small onion, sliced
- 1 (3 pound) whole chicken, cut in half, backbone removed
- salt as needed

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven broiler. Set an oven rack about 7 to 8 inches from the heat source.
2. Spread onion slices in a single layer on the bottom of a baking dish. Season chicken with salt. Place chicken halves skin-side down over onion rings.
3. Cook chicken in the preheated oven, turning every 7 minutes, until caramelized, no longer pink at the bone, and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
