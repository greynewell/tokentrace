## Ingredients

- ½ pound bacon, cut crosswise into 1/4-inch pieces
- 2 (9 ounce) packages refrigerated cheese tortellini
- 1 cup milk
- 1 cup mayonnaise
- 1 (1 ounce) package ranch dressing mix
- 3 (10 ounce) bags baby spinach
- 2 cups shredded red cabbage
- 1 cup cherry tomatoes, or more to taste

## Instructions

1. Heat a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir bacon until crispy, 7 to 10 minutes.
2. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate.
3. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
4. Cook tortellini in the boiling water until tender yet firm to the bite, 3  to 4 minutes; drain and run under cold water.
5. Whisk milk, mayonnaise, and ranch dressing mix together in a bowl until dressing is smooth.
6. Place a layer of spinach in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish; top with 1 cup cabbage and layer of tortellini, arranging tortellini so they are evenly spaced over the cabbage.
7. Sprinkle half of the bacon over tortellini layer.
8. Drizzle half of the dressing over salad.
9. Continue layering with remaining spinach, cabbage, tortellini, bacon (reserving a few for the end), and ending with cherry tomatoes.
