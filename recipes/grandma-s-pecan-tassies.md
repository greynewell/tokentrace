## Ingredients

- 1 cup butter, softened
- 6 ounces cream cheese, softened
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ cups firmly packed brown sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 2 tablespoons butter, melted
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- ⅛ teaspoon salt
- 1 ½ cups chopped pecans

## Instructions

1. Beat 1 cup butter and cream cheese with an electric mixer in a large bowl until creamy. Add flour gradually, beating at low speed. Shape mixture into 48 small balls and place on a baking sheet. Cover and chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour.
2. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease 2 mini-muffin pans. Press a dough ball into each cup in mini muffin tins to make pastry shells.
3. Whisk brown sugar, eggs, 2 tablespoons melted butter, vanilla extract, and salt together in a bowl. Stir in 1 1/4 cups pecans; spoon mixture into tart shells until 2/3 full. Top with remaining pecans.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes.
