## Ingredients

- 1 (17.5 ounce) pouch dry sugar cookie mix (such as Betty Crocker®)
- 1 stick butter, softened
- 1  egg
- 1 (14 ounce) can fat-free sweetened condensed milk
- 2  lemons, zested and juiced

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Grease an 8-inch square pan.
3. Pour cookie mix into a bowl and add butter.
4. Mix together using a fork until crumbly.
5. Add egg and mix until well blended.
6. Press 1/2 of the mixture into the bottom of the prepared pan; reserve remaining mixture for the topping.
7. Bake crust in the preheated oven for 15 minutes.
8. Meanwhile, combine condensed milk, lemon juice, and lemon zest in a bowl and mix well; filling may thicken as it sits.
