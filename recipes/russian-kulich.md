## Ingredients

- 1 ½ (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
- ¾ cup granulated sugar, divided
- 1 cup warm milk
- 4 cups all-purpose flour, divided
- 3  large whole eggs, separated
- 2  egg yolks
- ½ tablespoon brandy
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 10 tablespoons butter, melted and cooled
- ½ cup slivered blanched almonds, coarsely ground
- ¼ cup raisins
- 1 tablespoon water
- ¾ cup confectioners' sugar
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice

## Instructions

1. Stir together warm milk, yeast, and 1/4 teaspoon sugar in a large bowl and let stand until foamy, about 10 minutes. Stir in 1 1/2 cups flour until combined; cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap. Let stand in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.
2. Beat 4 yolks with remaining sugar in a bowl with an electric mixer at medium speed until mixture is thick and pale, 2 to 3 minutes. Beat in brandy and salt.
3. Stir yeast dough to deflate. Add yolk mixture and melted butter; stir until well blended. Beat 3 egg whites in a bowl with cleaned beaters until they hold soft peaks. Fold whites into batter, then stir in remaining 2 1/2 cups flour. Cover the bowl and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour 10 minutes.
4. Stir dough to deflate, then mix in almonds and raisins.
5. Butter 4 clean (10 1/2-ounce) coffee cans. Line bottom of each with a round of parchment or wax paper. Dust insides with flour, knocking out excess. Divide dough evenly among cans. Let dough rise in cans, covered with a towel, until about 1/2 inch from rim, about 1 hour.
6. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
7. Whisk together remaining yolk and water in a small bowl; lightly brush over tops of dough.
8. Bake loaves in cans in the preheated oven until tops are golden brown, 35 to 40 minutes. Turn loaves out onto a rack, turn right-side up, and let cool completely, about 1 1/2 hours.
9. Make glaze: Sift powdered sugar into a bowl, then stir in lemon juice until smooth.
10. Spread glaze over tops of loaves, letting it drip down the sides. Let loaves stand until icing is set, about 15 minutes.
