- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or as needed  (Optional)
- 1 ½ cups crumbled blue cheese
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or as needed
- 2 tablespoons water, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Heat 3/4 cup vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onions until golden brown and very tender, 20 to 30 minutes.
2. Add garlic and butter; cook and stir until butter is melted and garlic is fragrant, 5 to 10 minutes.
3. Remove skillet from heat and cool onion mixture to room temperature.
4. Combine warm water and olive oil in the bowl of a stand mixer.
5. Combine bread flour, white sugar, yeast, and kosher salt in a bowl; sift into the bowl with oil and water.
6. Attach dough hook to mixer; add parsley, rosemary, and marjoram and mix on medium speed until dough holds together and is no longer sticky, 5 to 8 minutes.
7. Turn dough onto a floured work surface and knead, adding flour if needed, until dough becomes somewhat firm.
8. Divide dough into six 10-ounce portions.
9. Roll each portion of dough into a 12-inch rectangle, dusting with flour if sticky.
10. Fill each rectangle with equal quantities onion mixture and 1/4 cup blue cheese.
11. Roll each rectangle into an oval baguette-shape stromboli, pinching the edges to close.
12. Grease 2 baking sheets with 1 tablespoon vegetable oil.
13. Generously brush the bottoms of each stromboli with water and transfer to the prepared baking sheets; cover with plastic wrap.
14. Allow stromboli to rise for 2 hours.
15. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
16. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, rotating the stromboli as needed for even browning, 45 minutes to 1 hour.
