## Ingredients

- 1  mango - peeled, seeded, and chopped
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking soda
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
- ¾ cup unsalted butter, softened
- ½ cup white sugar
- ½ cup brown sugar
- 3 large eggs
- 1 ¼ teaspoons vanilla extract
- ½ cup mashed banana
- ½ cup toasted shredded coconut
- ¼ cup chopped walnuts

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
2. Take about 1/4 of the chopped mango and puree in a food processor or blender until it is the same consistency as mashed bananas; it should yield about 1/2 cup pureed mango. Reserve remaining chopped mango.
3. Sift flour, baking soda, cinnamon, salt, and pumpkin pie spice together in a large bowl.
4. Combine butter, white sugar, and brown sugar in a small bowl until blended; mix in eggs and vanilla extract. Fold into the dry ingredients until just combined. Fold in chopped mango, pureed mango, banana, coconut, and walnuts. Let sit for 10 to 15 minutes. Pour into the prepared loaf pan.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 55 to 65 minutes.
