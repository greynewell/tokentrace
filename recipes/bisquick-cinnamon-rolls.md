## Ingredients

- 2 ¼ cups baking mix (such as Bisquick®)
- ⅔ cup milk
- 2 tablespoons softened butter
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 2 ½ cups white sugar
- ⅔ cup melted butter
- 5 tablespoons ground cinnamon
- 1 cup confectioners' sugar
- 3 tablespoons milk

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease a circular baking pan or line with parchment paper.
2. Combine baking mix, milk, softened butter, and sugar in a bowl. Mix until a dough forms.
3. Transfer dough to a surface floured with baking mix. Knead dough 10 times. Roll dough out using a lightly floured rolling pin until it is 1/4-inch thick.
4. Combine sugar, melted butter, and cinnamon in a bowl and mix until dark brown. Spoon filling onto rolled dough, spreading evenly to all edges. Roll dough inward; cut ends off and cut spiral into 12 pieces.
5. Place rolls into the prepared circular baking pan so that rolls touch.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until golden, 11 to 15 minutes. Let cool for 1 minute before transferring to a plate to cool completely.
7. While rolls are cooling, mix confectioners' sugar and milk together in a bowl until smooth. Spoon glaze over cooled cinnamon rolls.
