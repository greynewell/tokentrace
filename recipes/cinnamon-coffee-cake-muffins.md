## Ingredients

- 1 cup chopped pecans
- ¾ cup packed brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
- 2 cups cake flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¾ cup milk
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 ½ teaspoons instant coffee granules
- 1 cup white sugar
- ½ cup unsalted butter, softened
- 4 large eggs
- ½ cup unsweetened applesauce

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Line two 12-cup muffin tins with paper liners.
2. Place pecans on the prepared baking sheet.
3. Roast in the preheated oven until fragrant, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl with brown sugar and cinnamon. Mix until coated; set aside.
4. Meanwhile, sift flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Mix milk, vanilla extract, and coffee granules together in another bowl.
5. Combine sugar and butter in a large mixing bowl; beat with an electric mixer until sugar granules have dissolved and mixture is smooth and fluffy. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating briefly after each addition. Beat in applesauce until smooth and creamy. Add flour mixture in 2 batches, alternating with milk mixture, beating only until incorporated.
6. Spread 1 tablespoon batter into each prepared cupcake liner, making sure it covers the bottom. Add 1/2 tablespoon of pecan filling on top of each. Cover with remaining batter and top with remaining filling.
7. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 18 to 25 minutes. Cool in the tins for 10 minutes before putting onto cooling racks to cool completely.
