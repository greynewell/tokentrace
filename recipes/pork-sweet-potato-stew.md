## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- ⅓ cup brown sugar
- ⅓ cup all purpose flour
- ¼ cup Dijon mustard
- 3 pounds pork loin, cut into 1-inch cubes
- 3 tablespoons olive oil

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a large casserole dish or Dutch oven with cooking spray.
