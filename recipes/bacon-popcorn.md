## Ingredients

- ½ cup bacon grease
- ¾ cup unpopped popcorn kernels
- ½ teaspoon seasoned salt, or to taste
- 3 tablespoons bacon bits  (Optional)
- 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Place bacon grease into a 6-quart pot and place over high heat. Add one or two popcorn kernels as testers. When test kernels pop, add remaining popcorn kernels and cover with a lid. As kernels start to pop, shake the pan back and forth constantly to keep unpopped kernels on the bottom. When popping slows down, remove the pan from heat and let it finish popping.
2. Pour popcorn into a large bowl or paper sack. Season with 1/2 of the seasoned salt and stir. Taste before adding more salt if desired. Toss with bacon bits and shredded Cheddar cheese for an extra special treat. Store leftovers in lunch sacks or sandwich bags.
