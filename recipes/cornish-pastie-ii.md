## Ingredients

- 1 recipe pastry for a (10 inch) double crust pie
- 2 cups thinly sliced potatoes
- ½ cup sliced onion
- ½ pound boneless beef round steak, cut into thin strips
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt
- 1 pinch ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons butter

## Instructions

1. Divide pastry in three equal parts. Roll 1/3 to make 8x15 inch rectangle. Trim edges and cut to make two 7-inch squares. Place on baking sheet. Repeat with other two thirds of pastry.
2. Arrange layer of potatoes on half of each pastry square, top with layer of onion and then with beef. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and dot with butter.
3. Moisten pastry edges with cold water and fold over to make triangles; press edges together to make tight seal. A tight seal retains steam and makes juicy pastries.
4. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 1 hour or until meat is tender. Serve hot with chili sauce, ketchup, or pickle relish or serve cold for sandwiches.
