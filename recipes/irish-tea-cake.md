## Ingredients

- ½ cup butter, softened
- 1 cup white sugar
- 2  eggs
- 1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ cup milk
- ¼ cup confectioners' sugar for dusting

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9-inch round pan.
2. In a medium bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, mixing until fully incorporated; stir in the vanilla. Combine the flour, baking powder and salt; stir into the batter alternately with the milk. If the batter is too stiff, a tablespoon or two of milk may be added. Spread the batter evenly into the prepared pan.
3. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes in the preheated oven, until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Cool in pan on a wire rack, then turn out onto a serving plate. Dust with confectioners' sugar right before serving.
