## Ingredients

- 1 small butternut squash, halved and seeded
- 1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar, or more to taste
- 1 tablespoon dry mustard
- 1 tablespoon dried basil
- 4 cloves garlic, crushed
- 2 teaspoons brown sugar
- ½ cup olive oil
- 12 ounces deveined, shell-on shrimp
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice, or to taste
- 4  large green lettuce leaves, ripped
- 2  roma (plum) tomatoes, halved and seeded
- 1 small red onion, cut into matchstick-size pieces

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Place butternut, cut-side up, on a baking sheet. Brush cut sides with about 1 tablespoon olive oil; season with salt and pepper.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until flesh is tender when punctured with a fork, about 45 minutes. Remove from oven and let squash cool on baking sheet; remove peel and slice into 1/2-inch thick by 2-inch long pieces.
4. Whisk vinegar, mustard, basil, garlic, brown sugar, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl. Slowly drizzle oil into vinegar mixture while constantly whisking until dressing is silky and emulsified.
5. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil; cook shrimp until they are bright pink on the outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain shrimp and sprinkle with lemon juice, salt, and pepper.
6. Divide lettuce between 2 serving plates; top with butternut squash, tomatoes, and onion. Generously brush dressing onto squash and tomatoes. Arrange shrimp evenly on both plates.
