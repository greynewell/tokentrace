## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons mayonnaise
- 2 teaspoons sherry vinegar
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 2 cloves peeled garlic, crushed fine
- 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste
- 2 teaspoons olive oil
- 1  Hatch chile pepper, thinly sliced
- 1 pound Chilean sea bass filet, skinned and cut into two portions
- ½ teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste
- ¼ cup whole roasted Marcona almonds, or as needed
- ½ cup Sungold cherry tomatoes, halved

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment.
2. Mix together mayonnaise, sherry vinegar, smoked paprika, 1 teaspoon salt, garlic, and cayenne pepper in a small bowl until sauce is combined.
3. Spread olive oil on the bottom 2 individual-serving baking dishes. Cover oil with a single layer of pepper slices to cover the bottom of the dishes.
4. Season the fish generously with 1/2 teaspoon salt and place on top of the pepper slices. Spread the tops and sides of the fish with the prepared sauce, spreading the thickest layer on top. Grate almonds over the filets to cover. Transfer baking dishes to prepared baking sheet.
