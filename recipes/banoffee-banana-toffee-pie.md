## Ingredients

- 1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk, or more to taste
- 1 (9 inch) prepared graham cracker crust
- 3  bananas, sliced
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 2 tablespoons white sugar

## Instructions

1. Place unopened can of condensed milk in a large pot; cover with water. Bring to boil; reduce to a simmer. Cover pot with lid and simmer for 3 hours to make the toffee, checking periodically to ensure the can is still immersed and adding more water as needed.
