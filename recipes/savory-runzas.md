## Ingredients

- 4 ½ cups all-purpose flour, divided
- ½ cup white sugar
- 2 packages active dry yeast
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ¾ cup milk
- ½ cup water
- ½ cup shortening
- 2 large eggs, at room temperature
- ½ pound ground beef
- 1  onion, chopped
- 2 tablespoons salted butter
- 2 cups chopped cabbage
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper

## Instructions

1. Place 1 3/4 cups flour into a bowl. Stir in sugar, yeast, and salt.
2. Combine milk, water, and shortening in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat on high until warm (120 to 130 degrees F/50 to 55 degrees C), 2 to 3 minutes.
3. Pour heated milk into the flour mixture. Add eggs and beat at low speed for 30 seconds. Switch to high speed and beat for 3 minutes. Stir in the remaining flour. Knead until smooth, about 3 minutes. Cover the bowl with waxed paper and a towel; let rest for 20 minutes.
4. Cook ground beef and onion in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until beef is browned, 5 to 7 minutes.
5. At the same time, melt butter in a separate skillet over medium heat. Add cabbage and cook until wilted, about 5 minutes. Add cabbage to beef mixture with salt and pepper. Remove from the heat.
6. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a large baking sheet.
7. Roll dough on a lightly floured surface until very thin. Cut into 6 squares or rectangles, whichever you prefer. Place 3 tablespoons beef filling in the center of each shape. Bring corners together, pinch edges to seal, and place right-side up onto the prepared baking sheet. Let rise until an indentation remains when lightly pressed with a finger, 40 to 60 minutes.
8. Bake in the preheated oven until dough is done and golden brown, about 20 minutes.
