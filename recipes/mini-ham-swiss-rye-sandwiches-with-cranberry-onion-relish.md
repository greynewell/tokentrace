1. Heat oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions; saute until well-browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Add rosemary and cloves; continue to saute until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Stir in cranberry sauce, and simmer until heated through. Remove from heat and set aside. (Cranberry-Onion Relish can be cooled, covered and refrigerated up to 2 weeks ahead.)
