## Ingredients

- 1  Red Delicious apple - peeled, cored, and grated
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 3 tablespoons milk
- 1  egg
- ½ cup all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ⅛ teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon avocado oil, or as needed
- ½ teaspoon powdered sugar

## Instructions

1. Preheat an air fryer to 175 degrees F (80 degrees C).
2. Mix together grated apple and cinnamon in a small bowl. Whisk milk and egg together in a second bowl.
3. Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl; mix to combine. Stir in milk mixture until a dough forms. Fold in grated apples.
4. Cut a piece of parchment paper to fit the bottom of the air fryer basket. Brush paper with avocado oil until well coated; place into the air fryer basket.
5. Scoop out 1/4 of the dough and place in one corner of the air fryer basket; repeat with another 1/4 of the mixture to make 2 cookies.
