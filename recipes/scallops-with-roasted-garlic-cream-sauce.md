## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 head garlic, cut in half
- 1 cup chicken stock
- ½ cup cream
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- ½ pound sea scallops
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley for garnish

## Instructions

1. Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Spoon 3 tablespoons olive oil over the cut sides of the garlic head; wrap tightly in aluminum foil.
3. Roast in the preheated oven until the garlic is soft, about 30 minutes; set aside until cool enough to handle.

6. Stir the cream into the stock and remove from heat; set aside.
7. Melt the butter with 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
8. Season the scallops with salt and pepper; sear in the hot butter and oil mixture until opaque, about 3 minutes per side.
9. Remove from heat immediately.
10. Stir the lemon juice into the cream sauce; spoon immediately onto 2 plates.
11. Arrange the scallops on the plates.
12. Garnish with the parsley to serve.
