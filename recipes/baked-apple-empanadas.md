## Ingredients

- 1 cup butter
- 6 ounces cream cheese, softened
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 4 small apples - peeled, cored, and cut into small cubes
- ½ cup white sugar
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 pinch salt

## Instructions

1. Mix butter and cream cheese together in a bowl. Stir in flour until dough comes together and forms into a ball. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate 8 hours to overnight.
2. Combine apples, sugar, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and cover; cook, stirring frequently, until apples are the consistency of chunky applesauce, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and cool to room temperature.
3. Remove dough from the refrigerator and let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.
4. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
5. Divide dough into 10 pieces and roll into balls. Roll out each ball into a 3- to 4-inch circle with a rolling pin. Fill one side of the circle with apple filling. Moisten edges lightly with water. Fold dough over the filling and press edges together to seal.
6. Arrange empanadas on the prepared baking sheet.
7. Bake in the preheated oven until dough is golden, about 15 minutes.
