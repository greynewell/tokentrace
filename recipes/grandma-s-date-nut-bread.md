## Ingredients

- ½ cup raisins
- 1 ½ cups boiling water
- 2 teaspoons butter, or as needed
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 cup chopped pitted dates
- 7  pitted prunes, chopped
- ¼ cup unsalted butter, softened
- 1 cup sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1  egg, well-beaten
- 1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup chopped walnuts

## Instructions

1. Put raisins in a bowl. Pour boiling water over raisins; soak until raisins have flavored the water, about 20 minutes. Drain raisins, reserving the water. Discard raisins.
2. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a loaf pan with butter.
3. Bring reserved water to a boil in a small saucepan. Measure 3/4 cup boiling water into a bowl. Stir baking soda into water.
4. Put dates and prunes in a large bowl. Pour baking soda-water over dates and prunes; add unsalted butter and stir until melted. Stir sugar and vanilla extract into the fruit mixture; let cool to room temperature.
5. Stir egg into the fruit mixture to evenly coat. Mix flour and salt together in a small bowl; add to fruit mixture and stir. Fold walnuts into the mixture and pour into the prepared loaf pan.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 50 to 65 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
