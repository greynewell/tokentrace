## Ingredients

- 1 (12 ounce) package egg noodles
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- ¼ cup chopped onion
- ¼ cup chopped green bell pepper
- ¼ cup red bell pepper, chopped
- 1 (11 ounce) can condensed cream of Cheddar cheese soup
- 1 (5 ounce) can tuna, drained
- ¼ cup milk
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ground black pepper to taste
- ¼ cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rapid boil. Cook egg noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, 7 to 9 minutes.
3. While the noodles are cooking, heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Sauté onion and bell peppers in the hot oil until tender, 5 to 7 minutes.
4. Pour condensed soup into the saucepan. Add tuna, milk, salt, and pepper; mix until well combined. Reduce heat to medium-low.
5. Drain egg noodles well. Fold noodles into the tuna mixture until well coated. Transfer to a 2-quart casserole and sprinkle bread crumbs over top.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until the top is crisp and golden brown, 20 to 30 minutes.
