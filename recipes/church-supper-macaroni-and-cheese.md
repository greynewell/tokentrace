## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons salt
- 2 cups elbow macaroni
- ¼ cup butter, softened  (Optional)
- 2  large eggs
- 1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk
- ½ (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
- 1 ½ pounds extra-sharp Cheddar cheese, shredded
- 1 pinch paprika, or to taste
- ¼ cup butter  (Optional)
- ½ cup soft bread crumbs  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 2-quart casserole with butter.
2. Dissolve salt in a large pot of water. Bring to a boil and cook macaroni, stirring often, until pasta is tender but still slightly firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Rinse macaroni under cool water, drain, and transfer to a bowl. Stir 1/4 cup softened butter into macaroni and toss a few times to melt butter and coat macaroni.
3. Beat eggs in a bowl; whisk evaporated and condensed milks into eggs.
4. Spread a layer of macaroni into the bottom of the prepared casserole; sprinkle with a layer of Cheddar cheese. Continue layering macaroni and cheese, ending with a layer of cheese on top. Pour egg-milk mixture over the layers. Use a fork to gently dig into the layers, assuring that the egg-milk mixture flows into all the layers. Sprinkle with paprika.
5. Melt 1/4 cup butter in a small skillet over medium heat; cook bread crumbs in the hot butter, stirring constantly, until fragrant and golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Sprinkle crumb topping over casserole.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until casserole is browned and bubbling, about 45 minutes.
