## Ingredients

- 8  wooden skewers
- 8  breakfast sausage links
- 1 cup maple syrup
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon, or more to taste
- ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper  (Optional)
- 2 quarts vegetable oil for frying
- ¾ cup all-purpose flour
- ¾ cup cornmeal
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon chili powder
- ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper  (Optional)
- ¾ cup milk
- 1  egg

## Instructions

1. Soak wooden skewers on a shallow bowl of water for 30 minutes; drain.
2. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat; saute sausage links, turning every 2 minutes, until cooked through and browned, about 6 minutes. Thread each sausage onto a wooden skewer.
3. Whisk maple syrup, cinnamon, and 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper together in a saucepan over low heat until warmed, 2 to 4 minutes. Remove maple dip from heat.
4. Heat about 2 inches of oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 360 degrees F (182 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with paper towels.
5. Whisk flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, chili powder, and 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper together in a bowl. Add milk and egg; whisk just until batter is smooth. Pour batter into a tall water glass to 3/4 full.
6. Dip each sausage into the batter, swirling and dipping to evenly coat.
7. Place the battered sausages gently in the hot oil, 4 at a time; cook, turning every 30 to 60 seconds, until evenly browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Adjust heat as needed to maintain 360 degrees F (182 degrees C). Transfer corn dogs to the paper towel-lined baking sheet. Serve with the maple dip.
