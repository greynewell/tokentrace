## Ingredients

- 5 cups frozen blueberries
- 1 cup white sugar
- 5 tablespoons cornstarch
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
- ¾ cup salted butter
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 6 tablespoons cold water, or more as needed
- 1 tablespoon salted butter, cut into small pieces
- 1 teaspoon salted butter, or as needed
- ¼ cup milk

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Make the filling: Combine frozen blueberries, sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, and salt in a medium pot; mix well to coat blueberries. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring often, 10 to 15 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, make the crust: Combine flour and salt in a large mixing bowl. Cut in 3/4 cup butter with 2 knives or pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing with a fork, until flour mixture is moistened. Do not add more water than you need: when you squeeze a handful of the moistened pastry mixture, it should form a ball.
4. Divide the dough in half and shape into balls. Roll out 1 dough ball with a rolling pin into a 10-inch circle. Transfer crust to a 9-inch pie dish. Trim the edge of the crust with scissors and crimp the rim with fingertips and knuckles.
5. Pour filling into prepared pie crust. Dot with 1 tablespoon butter.
6. Roll top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 1/2-inch strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Start with the longest strips and lay the first 2 in an X in the center of the pie. Alternate horizontal and vertical strips, weaving them in an over-and-under pattern. Use shortest strips for the edges of the lattice. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and flute the crust.
7. Combine remaining 1 teaspoon butter with milk in a microwave-safe cup. Microwave at 10-second intervals until butter is melted; brush over pie.
8. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and bubbly, about 30 minutes.
