## Ingredients

- 1 cup diced celery
- 5 tablespoons butter
- 1  onion, chopped
- ½  green bell pepper, chopped
- 6 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 (10.75 ounce) can  cream of mushroom soup
- 1 (10.75 ounce) can  milk

- 3 cups diced cooked turkey
- 1 (4 ounce) jar chopped pimento peppers

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook celery at a boil until tender, 5 to 10 minutes; drain.
3. Heat butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion and bell pepper in the melted butter until softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Whisk flour into the onion mixture until the butter and flour form a paste. Add mushroom soup, milk, and mushrooms; cook, stirring occasionally, until mixture is smooth, 5 to 10 minutes.
