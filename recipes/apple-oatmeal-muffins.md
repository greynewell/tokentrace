## Ingredients

- ⅓ cup tightly packed brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 ½ tablespoons butter, cut into small pieces
- 2 cups peeled and finely chopped apples
- 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
- ¾ cup white sugar
- ½ cup honey
- ½ cup buttermilk
- ½ cup oil
- 2 large eggs
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 cup quick-cooking oats
- 2 cups whole wheat flour
- 2 ½ teaspoons baking powder
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon nutmeg
- ½ teaspoon salt

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 18 muffin tin cups with cupcake papers.
2. Mix brown sugar, all-purpose flour, and cinnamon together in a small bowl for crumb topping. Add butter and press with the back of a spoon or your fingers to incorporate it into the sugar mixture. Mix until crumbly and set aside.
3. Toss apples with lemon juice in a large bowl. Mix in sugar, honey, buttermilk, oil, eggs, and vanilla until combined. Stir in oats.
4. Combine whole wheat flour, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda, nutmeg, and salt in a smaller bowl. Gently fold flour mixture into the wet ingredients with a large spoon, until flour is just mixed in. Spoon batter into the prepared cupcake papers and sprinkle about 1 teaspoon crumb topping on top of each one.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool on a wire rack.
