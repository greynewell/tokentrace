## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Prepare Lemon Vinaigrette; cover and set aside.
2. Lemon Vinaigrette: In a medium bowl whisk together lemon juice, shallot, mustard, lemon zest, and honey. In a steady stream, slowly whisk in 1/3 cup olive oil. Makes 2/3 cup.

Cool 20 minutes or until able to handle. Remove and discard foil. Trim off stem and root ends of roasted beets. Peel and cut into 1-inch pieces.
4. In a medium bowl combine beets, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper and 3 tablespoons of the vinaigrette.
5. In another medium bowl combine fennel, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and 3 tablespoons of the vinaigrette.
