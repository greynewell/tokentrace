## Ingredients

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- ¼ cup cocoa powder
- 1 tablespoon pumpkin pie spice
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ¼ teaspoon baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¾ cup brown sugar
- 1 cup pumpkin puree
- 2 large eggs
- ¼ cup vegetable oil
- ¼ cup sour cream
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 cup chocolate chips, divided

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin or line cups with paper liners.
2. Whisk flour, cocoa powder, pumpkin pie spice, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Mix in brown sugar, making sure everything is well combined.
3. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients with a spoon. Add in pumpkin puree, eggs, vegetable oil, sour cream, and vanilla extract. Stir until batter is just blended. Add 3/4 cup chocolate chips and stir until well combined.
4. Divide batter evenly between the prepared 12 muffin cups. Sprinkle remaining 1/4 cup chocolate chips on top.
