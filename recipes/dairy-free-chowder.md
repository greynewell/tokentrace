## Ingredients

- ¼ cup vegetable oil
- 1 small onion, diced
- 2 stalks celery, chopped
- 2 slices bacon, diced
- 2 medium russet potatoes, peeled and diced, or more to taste
- 1 (8 ounce) bottle clam juice
- 2 ½ cups minced clams, drained
- ¼ cup vegetable oil
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- 2 cups almond milk
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Heat 1/4 cup oil a large pot over medium heat. Add onion, celery, and bacon to hot oil; cook and stir until bacon fat renders and onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add potatoes and clam juice. Increase heat to medium-high and bring to a boil. Cook until potatoes are fork-tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Add clams and cook for 10 minutes more.
2. Meanwhile, combine remaining 1/4 cup oil and flour in a separate saucepan over medium heat. Stir until paste-like and light golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Gradually whisk in almond milk; cook and stir until mixture becomes a thick slurry, 6 to 7 minutes more.
3. Stir slurry into clam chowder until thickened. Season with salt and pepper; serve hot.
