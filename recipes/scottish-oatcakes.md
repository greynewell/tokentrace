- 1 teaspoon lemon zest
- 2 teaspoons lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon honey, or to taste
- 1 large egg
- ¼ teaspoon fine salt

## Instructions

1. Bring oats and heavy cream to a simmer in a pot over medium-high heat. Stir and cook for 1 minute and turn off the heat. Let cool down to room temperature, at least 10 minutes.
