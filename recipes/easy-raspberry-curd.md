## Ingredients

- 1 (6 ounce) container fresh raspberries
- ½ cup white sugar
- 2  eggs
- ¼ cup butter
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice

## Instructions

1. Combine raspberries and sugar in a high-powered blender (such as Vitamix®).
2. Carefully crack eggs into a small glass bowl, making sure no pieces of shell fall into the bowl. Pour eggs into the blender with the raspberry mixture. Cover and blend on low Variable 1, quickly adjusting to Variable 10. Blend on high speed for 1 minute.
3. Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Pour in raspberry mixture through a sieve. Add lemon juice. Cook and stir until curd thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes.
