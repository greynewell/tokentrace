## Ingredients

- 2  large artichokes
- 1  lemon, quartered
- ¾ cup olive oil
- 4 cloves garlic, chopped
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper

## Instructions

1. Fill a large bowl with cold water. Squeeze the juice from one lemon wedge into the water. Trim the tops from artichokes, then cut in half lengthwise, and place halves into the bowl of lemon water to prevent them from turning brown.
2. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Meanwhile, preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat.
3. Add artichokes to boiling water, and cook until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain.
4. Squeeze remaining lemon wedges into a medium bowl. Stir in olive oil and garlic, and season with salt and pepper.
5. Brush artichokes with a coating of the garlic dip, and place them on the preheated grill. Grill artichokes, basting with dip and turning frequently, until the tips are a little charred, 5 to 10 minutes.
6. Serve immediately with the remaining dip.
