## Ingredients

- 6 ounces center-cut bacon, cut into small pieces
- 1 tablespoon butter, or as needed
- 1 pound fresh green beans, trimmed
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- 3 tablespoons water
- 2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese

## Instructions

1. Cook bacon in an oven-proof skillet over medium-high heat until brown and crispy, 5 to 6 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon to a paper towel-lined plate, reserving bacon grease in the skillet. Reduce heat to medium and add enough butter to equal 2 tablespoons of fat in the skillet.
2. Add green beans to the skillet and season with salt and pepper to taste. Sprinkle with garlic powder, toss to coat, and saute for 3 to 4 minutes. Add water to help steam the beans. Continue cooking until water has evaporated and beans are crisp-tender or cooked to your liking, 3 to 4 more minutes.
3. Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
4. Top beans with shredded Cheddar cheese and sprinkle with cooked bacon.
5. Place skillet under broiler until cheese has melted, about 1 minute. Serve immediately.
