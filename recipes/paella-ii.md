## Ingredients

- 20  mussels, cleaned and debearded
- 10 large shrimp
- 2 large squid, cleaned and sliced into rings
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken pieces cut into chunks
- 3 cloves garlic, chopped
- 1  red bell pepper, sliced
- 2  tomatoes, cubed
- 3 cups long-grain white rice
- 1 pinch saffron
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1 cup green peas

## Instructions

1. In a pot of lightly salted water, boil the mussels until they open. Drain, and discard unopened mussels. In a separate pot of lightly salted water, boil the prawns and squid until opaque, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain, reserving liquid.
2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet. Place chicken pieces in the skillet, fry them until they are golden brown. Remove the chicken pieces from the skillet and set aside.
3. Place garlic, peppers and tomato cubes into the skillet that the chicken was just removed from. Fry the vegetables until they soften.
4. Bring the fish stock and 3 cups salted water to a boil and mix in 3 cups rice, saffron and paprika. Bring to a boil again. Cover, reduce heat and simmer for 50 minutes or until rice is tender.
5. Stir the peas into the rice. Pour the rice mixture into a large serving dish. Arrange the fried vegetables, chicken, shellfish and prawns around the rice. Serve hot.
