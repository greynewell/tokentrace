## Ingredients

- 2 ½ cups wheat berries
- 1 ½ cups spelt flour
- ½ cup barley
- ½ cup millet
- ¼ cup dry green lentils
- 2 tablespoons dry great Northern beans
- 2 tablespoons dry kidney beans
- 2 tablespoons dried pinto beans
- 4 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)

## Instructions

1. Measure the water, honey, olive oil, and yeast into a large bowl. Let sit for 3 to 5 minutes.
