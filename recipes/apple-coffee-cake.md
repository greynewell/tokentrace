## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 1 tablespoon flour, or as needed
- ¼ cup butter, softened
- ¾ cup brown sugar
- 1  large egg
- ¼ cup sour cream
- ¼ cup vanilla yogurt
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- ¾ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 2 cups diced Granny Smith apple
- ¼ cup brown sugar
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons butter
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray an 8-inch square baking dish with cooking spray; dust with 1 tablespoon flour.
2. Beat 1/4 cup butter and 3/4 cup brown sugar together with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy. The mixture should be noticeably lighter in color. Beat egg into butter mixture. Add sour cream, vanilla yogurt, and vanilla extract to the mixture; beat to integrate.
3. Stir 1 cup flour, 3/4 teaspoon cinnamon, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl; add to the butter mixture and beat to combine into a batter. Fold apples into the batter. Pour batter into prepared baking dish.
4. Mix 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup flour, 2 tablespoons butter, and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon together in a bowl using a fork to achieve a crumbly consistency; sprinkle over the top of the batter.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
