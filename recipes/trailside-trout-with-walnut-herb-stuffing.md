## Ingredients

- 2 cups cracker crumbs
- 3 tablespoons minced walnut pieces
- 1 teaspoon dried dill weed
- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
- ¼ cup chopped watercress leaves
- 2 tablespoons water
- 1 tablespoon dried minced onion
- 1 tablespoon dried parsley
- 2 teaspoons soy sauce
- 4  whole trout

## Instructions

1. At home: Mix cracker crumbs, walnuts, and dill in a resealable plastic bag. Store oil, watercress, water onion, parsley, and soy sauce in individual bags and containers and combine them in a larger, self-sealing plastic bag labeled with recipe instructions.
2. On the trail: Place onion in a skillet with 1 tablespoon of the oil. Cook and stir over low to medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Add parsley and water. Cover and steam for a minute or so; stir in the watercress.
3. Combine the cracker-walnut mixture with the onion-parsley mixture in a medium bowl to make the stuffing. Stir in soy sauce.
4. Stuff each trout with 1/4 of the walnut-herb stuffing. Heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat and add remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Add trout to skillet, cover, and cook until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 10 minutes per side.
