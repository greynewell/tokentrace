## Ingredients

- 1  jalapeno pepper
- 1 (7.5 ounce) package corn bread/muffin mix
- 1  beaten egg
- ⅓ cup milk

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack at about 6 inches from the heat source.
2. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
3. Wear gloves to prevent hot pepper oil from contacting skin.
4. Cut the pepper in half from top to bottom; remove the stem, seeds, and ribs, then place the pepper cut-side-down onto the prepared baking sheet.
5. Cook under the preheated broiler until the skin of the pepper has blackened and blistered, about 5 minutes.
6. Place the blackened pepper into a bowl, and tightly seal with plastic wrap.
7. Allow the pepper to steam as it cools, about 10 minutes.
8. Once cool, remove the skin and discard; chop the pepper.
9. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
10. Grease an 8x8-inch baking dish.
11. In a mixing bowl, combine the corn bread mix, egg, and milk; stir just to combine.
12. Lightly mix in the pineapple and jalapeno.
13. Scoop batter into the prepared baking dish.
14. Bake in the preheated oven until the top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes.
