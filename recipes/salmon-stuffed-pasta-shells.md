## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons olive oil, divided, or as needed
- 16  jumbo pasta shells
- 1 pound fresh salmon
- 1 tablespoon minced onion
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic
- 3 tablespoons chopped fresh dill
- 1 pinch dried parsley
- ½ cup white wine
- ½ (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 2 cups half-and-half
- ½ cup white wine
- 2 tablespoons cream cheese
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill
- 1 tablespoon salted butter
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a large baking dish lightly with 1 tablespoon olive oil.
2. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add shells and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 9 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons oil in a well-seasoned frying pan over medium-high heat. Cook salmon with onion, garlic, dill, and parsley in the hot oil until it easily flakes with a fork, flipping once, about 10 minutes total. Add white wine and cream cheese. Fold into the fish mixture until everything is well coated. Season with salt and pepper.
4. Drain pasta shells. Stuff shells with mixture and place into the prepared baking dish. Cover with foil.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and heated through, about 20 minutes.
6. While the shells are cooking, mix half-and-half, wine, cream cheese, dill, butter, garlic, salt, and pepper together in a saucepan and cook the sauce over medium heat until butter and cream cheese have melted, 5 to 7 minutes.
7. Remove shells from the oven and top with cream sauce. Serve.
