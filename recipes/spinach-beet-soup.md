## Ingredients

- 1 cup orzo pasta
- 4 cups fresh spinach
- ½ cup canned sliced beets
- 1 teaspoon butter
- 2 cups water, or to taste
- 1 teaspoon thyme
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons sour cream
- ¼ cup shredded Cheddar cheese

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook orzo in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain, reserving some of the water.
2. Combine spinach and beets in a blender adding as much of the reserved water as needed to help the mixture blend smoothly; blend until smooth.
3. Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Stir blended spinach mixture with the melted butter; cook until the color begins to change, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir water into the mixture to thin the liquid. Stir drained orzo pasta into the soup; season with thyme, salt, and pepper. Remove pot from heat and stir sour cream through the soup. Sprinkle with Cheddar cheese to serve.
