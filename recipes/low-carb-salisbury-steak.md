## Ingredients

- 2 pounds ground beef
- 1  onion, diced
- 2  eggs
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tablespoon dried parsley flakes
- 2 teaspoons salt
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon onion powder  (Optional)
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 7 tablespoons butter
- 2 cups sliced button mushrooms, or more to taste
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
- 1 cup beef broth
- 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
- ½ cup sour cream
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Mix ground beef, onion, eggs, 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce, parsley, 2 teaspoons salt, garlic powder, onion powder, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper together in a bowl. Split steak mixture into 6 portions and form into patties.
2. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook patties, 3 at a time, until slightly browned on one side, about 5 minutes. Flip and cook until other side is browned, about 5 minutes more. Repeat with remaining patties, pouring off any excess liquid. Place Salisbury steaks on a plate and cover with aluminum foil to maintain heat.
3. Melt butter in the same skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms and cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer mushrooms to a bowl, reserving butter in the skillet.
4. Stir flour into the butter until dissolved. Pour in beef broth slowly, stirring until thickened, about 7 minutes. Add 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce; cook, stirring frequently, until gravy starts to thicken slightly, about 5 minutes. Add sour cream and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring until all sour cream is melted and gravy is light brown, about 2 minutes.
5. Stir mushrooms back into the gravy. Remove from heat and let cool until thickened, about 2 minutes. Ladle gravy and mushrooms over steak patties.
