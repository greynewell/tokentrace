## Ingredients

- 2 cups orange juice
- 1  yellow onion, sliced
- ½ cup freshly squeezed lime juice
- ½ cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 10 cloves garlic, smashed
- 2 tablespoons dark brown sugar
- 1 ½ tablespoons kosher salt
- 1 tablespoon dried oregano
- 1 tablespoon ground cumin
- 2 teaspoons freshly grated lime zest
- 2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
- 2  dried bay leaves
- 3 ½ pounds bone-in pork shoulder roast

## Instructions

1. Mix orange juice, onion, lime juice, olive oil, garlic, brown sugar, salt, oregano, cumin, lime zest, pepper, and bay leaves in a heavy Dutch oven. Add pork shoulder; turn to coat. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator, 4 hours to overnight.
2. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Remove Dutch oven from the refrigerator and cover tightly with aluminum foil.
3. Bake pork in the preheated oven until heated through, about 1 1/2 hours. Flip pork carefully. Replace foil and bake for 1 hour more. Remove aluminum foil. Continue baking uncovered, turning once halfway through, until pork falls apart and marinade is reduced, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
4. Remove pork from oven and let rest for 20 minutes. Shred pork in the Dutch oven using 2 forks; mix shredded pork with the reduced marinade. Discard bay leaves.
