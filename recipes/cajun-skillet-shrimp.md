- 2 cloves garlic
- 3 tablespoons butter
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning
- 1 pound uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 1 loaf French bread

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Saute garlic in the hot oil until brown, about 2 minutes. Add butter, Worcestershire, lemon juice, and Cajun seasoning. Let simmer until butter has melted through, 3 to 5 minutes.
