## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 3 tablespoons vegan butter (such as Earth Balance®)
- 3 tablespoons coconut oil
- 1 cup cold unsweetened almond milk, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking pan with parchment paper or a nonstick silicone baking mat, such as SILPAT™.
2. Whisk together flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Cut in vegan butter and coconut oil with a pastry blender or a fork until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
3. Slowly add cold almond milk and stir until dough just comes together. It may not be necessary to use all the milk; dough will be wet and sticky.
4. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead (fold over) 15 times. Gently roll or pat dough to a 1- or 1 1/2-inch thickness. Cut biscuits with a small biscuit cutter or a small bourbon glass. Gently re-roll the dough scraps and cut remaining biscuits.
5. Place biscuits on the prepared baking sheet. Be sure they are touching each other and the sides of the pan; don't be afraid to squish them in--this helps them to rise high.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until tops are golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes.
