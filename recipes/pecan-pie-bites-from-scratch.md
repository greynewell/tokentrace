## Ingredients

- ½ cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 3 ounces cream cheese, softened
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- nonstick cooking spray
- ¾ cup brown sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ½ cup finely chopped pecans

## Instructions

1. Beat butter and cream cheese for crust with an electric mixer until smooth. Add flour and mix until fully combined. Cover and refrigerate dough for 1 hour.
2. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Remove dough from the refrigerator. Spray a 24-cup mini-muffin tin with nonstick spray.
3. Whisk brown sugar, egg, melted butter, and vanilla for filling in a bowl until smooth.
4. Roll dough into twenty four 1-inch balls. Press each ball into a muffin cup, so it spreads evenly on the bottom and up the sides. Sprinkle about 1 teaspoon pecans into each muffin cup, then top with about the same amount of egg mixture.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until filling is set, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes, then remove from the muffin tins.
