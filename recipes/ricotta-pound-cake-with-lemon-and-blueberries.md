## Ingredients

- 1 cup granulated erythritol sweetener (such as Swerve®)
- ½ cup unsalted butter, room temperature
- 4 large eggs, divided
- 1 ¼ cups whole milk ricotta cheese
- 1 tablespoon lemon zest
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- 2 ½ cups blanched almond flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- ⅓ cup fresh blueberries

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a fluted tube pan (such as Bundt®) or a silicone Bundt® mold.
2. Combine sweetener, butter, and 1 egg in a large bowl. Beat with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add ricotta cheese, lemon zest, and vanilla extract; mix until well combined.
3. Whisk almond flour and baking powder together in a separate bowl until well combined.
4. Alternate adding almond flour mixture and remaining 3 eggs, one at a time, to the batter, mixing well after each addition. Gently fold in blueberries and pour batter into the prepared pan.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean and the center is fully baked; about 50 minutes. Cool in the pan for 15 minutes before inverting the cake onto a wire rack to cool completely.
