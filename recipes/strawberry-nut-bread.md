## Ingredients

- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 3 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 2 cups white sugar
- 2 cups sliced fresh strawberries
- 4  eggs
- 1 ¼ cups vegetable oil
- 1 cup chopped walnuts

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease 2 9x5 inch loaf pans.
2. Sift together the flour, baking soda, salt, ground cinnamon and sugar in a large mixing bowl. Make a well in the center. Beat together the eggs and oil and pour them into the well. Stir just enough to moisten the ingredients. Fold in the strawberries and nuts. Pour mixture into prepared pans; fill containers no more than half full.
