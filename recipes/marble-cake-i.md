## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup white sugar
- ½ cup butter, softened
- 2  eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 cup milk
- 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9-inch round pan.
2. Place flour, sugar, milk, eggs, butter, baking powder, vanilla, and salt into a large bowl. Mix slowly to moisten, then beat with an electric mixer at medium speed for about 2 minutes until smooth. Reserve 3/4 cup batter; pour remaining batter into the prepared pan.
3. Stir cocoa into reserved batter until even in color. Drop chocolate batter by large spoonfuls on top of vanilla batter; swirl cocoa batter into white batter using a knife to create a marbled appearance.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 to 35 minutes. Cool briefly on a wire rack before inverting carefully onto a serving plate or cooling rack. Let cool completely.
