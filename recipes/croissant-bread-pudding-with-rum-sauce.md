## Ingredients

- 2 cups milk
- 2 cups white sugar
- ½ cup unsalted butter, melted
- 2  eggs
- 4  bananas, cut into small chunks
- 10  croissants, cut into 1-inch pieces
- 1 cup brown sugar
- ½ cup unsalted butter
- ¼ cup rum (such as Captain Morgan®)
- 2 tablespoons heavy cream, or more to taste

## Instructions

1. Whisk milk, sugar, butter, and eggs together in a large bowl. Add bananas. Add croissants and mix well.
2. Pour mixture into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Refrigerate for 1 hour so croissants can absorb some of the liquid.
3. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
4. Bake in the preheated oven until center is set and top is golden brown, about 1 hour. Let cool for 30 minutes before slicing.
5. Meanwhile, combine brown sugar, butter, and rum in a saucepan. Cook and stir until melted together, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in heavy cream. Pour warm sauce over the bread pudding right before serving.
