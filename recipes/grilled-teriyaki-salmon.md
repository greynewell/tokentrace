## Ingredients

- ½ cup teriyaki sauce
- ½ cup apple juice
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar, or more to taste
- 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
- ½ teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 (6 ounce) fillets salmon

## Instructions

1. Whisk teriyaki sauce, apple juice, brown sugar, vinegar, pepper, and garlic together in a small bowl.
2. Place salmon fillets in a glass baking dish. Pour marinade over top, cover, and refrigerate for 4 to 6 hours.
3. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
4. Remove salmon fillets from the marinade and shake off excess. Pour marinade into a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until reduced, about 5 minutes.
5. At the same time, grill salmon fillets on the preheated grill until fish flakes easily with a fork, 3 to 4 minutes per side.
6. Serve fillets with reduced marinade drizzled over top.
