## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 2 (7 ounce) salmon fillets, skin removed
- 1 (6 ounce) can lump crabmeat, drained and flaked
- 1 (4 ounce) can tiny shrimp, drained
- ½ cup chopped mushrooms
- ¼ cup mayonnaise
- ¼ cup shredded Parmesan cheese
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 2 tablespoons chopped green onion
- 2 tablespoons dry bread crumbs
- ½ teaspoon seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®), or more to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly spray a sheet pan with cooking spray.
2. Cut a slit through the middle of each salmon fillet, about 2/3 the length of the fillet. Set aside.
3. Mix crab, shrimp, mushrooms, mayonnaise, Parmesan cheese, lemon juice, green onion, and bread crumbs together in a bowl.
4. Shape 2/3 of the stuffing mixture into 2 large mounds on the prepared sheet pan. Spread open the fillets and place one over each mound. Fill in the top of the slits with remaining stuffing. Season each fillet with seafood seasoning.
