## Ingredients

- 1 pound peeled and deveined jumbo shrimp, thawed if frozen
- ¼ teaspoon sea salt
- ¼ teaspoon black pepper
- ½ cup coconut flour
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- 2  eggs
- 2 tablespoons water
- ⅔ cup finely chopped macadamia nuts
- ⅔ cup unsweetened shredded coconut
- 2 tablespoons ghee, or more to taste

## Instructions

1. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Sprinkle shrimp with salt and pepper.
2. Stir together coconut flour, garlic powder, and onion powder in a shallow dish. Thoroughly whisk eggs and water in a second shallow dish. Mix together macadamia nuts and coconut in a third shallow dish.
