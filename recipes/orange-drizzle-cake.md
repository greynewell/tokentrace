## Ingredients

- 1 cup self-rising flour
- 3 large eggs
- ⅔ cup superfine sugar
- ⅔ cup salted butter, melted
- 2 tablespoons orange juice
- 1 tablespoon grated orange zest
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ½ cup superfine sugar
- ¼ cup orange juice

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch cake pan well using butter and flour.
2. Combine flour, eggs, sugar, butter, orange juice, orange zest, and baking powder in a bowl. Mix with an electric hand mixer or stand mixer until batter comes together and is pale in color. Pour into the prepared pan.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 30 to 40 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool in the pan for 5 minutes. Carefully remove from the pan and place on a cooling rack with a tray underneath.
4. While cake cools, combine sugar and orange juice for drizzle in a small bowl. Pour over the still-warm cake. Let cool completely before slicing.
