## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 ¼ pounds fresh swordfish, cut into chunks
- 1 small onion, chopped
- 1 teaspoon all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ cups dry white wine
- 1 (19 ounce) can fava beans, drained
- 1 bunch fresh parsley, chopped

## Instructions

1. Mix together 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl. Add the fish and stir enough to get it coated. Let it marinate for about 15 minutes. Remove fish from the marinade and pat dry.
2. Heat remaining olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry the onion until golden, about 8 minutes, then add the fish. Brown the chunks of fish, about 1 minute per side; remove from the pan and set aside.
3. Stir the flour into the skillet; cook and stir until lightly browned. Gradually stir in the white wine. Return the fish to the pan, and add the fava beans. Sprinkle with fresh parsley, cover, and simmer for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the fish flakes easily with a fork. Serve hot.
