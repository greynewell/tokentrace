## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups water
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt
- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 3 ¼ cups bread flour
- 1 ½ teaspoons bread machine yeast

## Instructions

1. Place ingredients into the pan of the bread machine in the order suggested by the manufacturer. Select the Dough cycle, and Start. (See Editor's Note for stand mixer instructions.)
2. Dough will be quite sticky and wet once cycle is completed; resist the temptation to add more flour. Place dough on a generously floured board, cover with a large bowl or greased plastic wrap, and let rest for 15 minutes.
3. Lightly flour baking sheets or line them with parchment paper. Using a serrated knife, divide dough into 2 pieces, and form each into a 3x14-inch oval. Place loaves on prepared sheets and dust lightly with flour. Cover, and let rise in a draft-free place for approximately 45 minutes.
4. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
5. Spritz loaves with water. Place loaves in the oven, positioned on the middle rack. Bake until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.
