## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 pound extra-lean ground beef
- ½  onion, diced
- ¼ cup tomato sauce
- 6  large pimento-stuffed olives, diced
- 2 tablespoons sofrito (such as Goya®)
- 1 (1.41 ounce) package sazon seasoning with coriander and achiote (such as Goya®)
- 2 small garlic cloves, minced and crushed
- ½ teaspoon oregano
- 2 (14 ounce) packages frozen empanada dough (such as Goya® discos)

## Instructions

1. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion, tomato sauce, olives, sofrito, sazon, garlic, and oregano. Bring to a simmer and cook until mixture thickens, about 15 minutes.
2. Spoon 1 heaping tablespoon of meat mixture into the middle of a disco. Fold dough over, moisten edges, and press with a fork to seal. Repeat with remaining meat mixture and discos.
3. Pour oil into a saucepan and heat over medium-high heat. Fry pastelillos until golden brown and bubbly, about 3 minutes each. Drain on paper towels before serving.
