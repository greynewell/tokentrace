## Ingredients

- 2  red apples
- ¼ cup raisins
- 1 tablespoon peanut butter
- 8  thin pretzel sticks

## Instructions

1. Slice apples in half from top to bottom and scoop out the cores using a knife or melon baller. If you have an apple corer, core them first, then slice. Place each apple half flat side down on a small plate.
2. Dab peanut butter on to the back of the 'lady bug', then stick raisins onto the dabs for spots. Use this method to make eyes too. Stick one end of each pretzel stick into a raisin, then press the other end into the apples to make antennae.
