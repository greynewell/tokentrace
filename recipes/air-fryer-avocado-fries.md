## Ingredients

- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1  egg
- 1 teaspoon water
- 1  ripe avocado, halved, seeded, peeled and cut into 8 slices
- ½ cup panko bread crumbs
- cooking spray

## Instructions

1. Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Mix flour, pepper, and salt together in a shallow bowl. Beat together egg and water in a second shallow bowl. Place panko in a third shallow bowl.
3. Dredge an avocado slice through the flour, shaking off excess. Dip into egg and allow excess to drop off, then press into panko so both sides are covered. Set on a plate and repeat with the remaining slices.
4. Spray avocado slices generously with cooking spray and arrange in the air fryer basket, sprayed-side down. Spray the top side of the avocado slices as well.
5. Cook in the preheated air fryer for 4 minutes. Turn avocado slices over and cook until golden, about 3 more minutes.
