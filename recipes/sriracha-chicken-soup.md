## Ingredients

- 2 large tomatoes
- 2 cups chopped carrot
- 1 pinch ground cinnamon, or more to taste
- 1 pinch salt to taste
- red onion, sliced
- 5 cloves garlic
- 1  fresh jalapeno pepper
- 3 tablespoons Sriracha hot chile sauce, or to taste
- 1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or to taste
- 1 ½ cups water
- 1 cube chicken bouillon, or more to taste
- 2 cups shredded cooked chicken
- 1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat an oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
2. Roast tomatoes in preheated oven on the prepared baking sheet until completely softened, about 25 minutes. Transfer tomatoes to a cutting board to cool.
3. Spread chopped carrot onto the prepared baking sheet; season with a pinch of cinnamon and salt.
4. Roast carrots in preheated oven until tender, about 25 minutes.
5. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Toast onion slices, garlic cloves, and jalapeno pepper in the skillet until beginning to char, 5 to 7 minutes.
6. Peel cooled tomatoes and put in a blender bowl; add onion, garlic, jalapeno pepper, Sriracha chile sauce, and 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon and puree until smooth.
7. Heat vegetable oil in a large stockpot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Stir pureed tomato mixture into the oil; cook and stir until the mixture thickens, about 5 minutes.
8. Pour water into the pot; add chicken bouillon and stir. Bring liquid to a simmer, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook mixture, stirring occasionally, until the liquid reduces slightly, about 15 minutes.
9. Stir chicken and black beans into the soup; bring again to a simmer and cook until beans are softened, about 15 minutes. Add carrots and cook to reheat the carrots, 2 to 3 minutes. Season soup with salt and pepper.
