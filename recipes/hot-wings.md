## Ingredients

- 4 pounds chicken wings
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 cup tomato-based hot pepper sauce
- 2 tablespoons vinegar-based hot pepper sauce
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder

## Instructions

2. Season wings with garlic powder and ground black pepper. Cook wings on the preheated grill until they are very crispy. Turn the wings frequently as they will burn easily.
