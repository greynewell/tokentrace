## Ingredients

- 1 (10 ounce) can low-sodium cream of mushroom soup  (Optional)
- 2  skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cubed
- 2 (10 ounce) packages frozen cauliflower and broccoli mix
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 ½ cups milk
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ cups shredded Cheddar cheese, or more to taste
- 1 pinch garlic powder, or to taste
- ½ cup seasoned bread crumbs, or more to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Combine 1/2 the mushroom soup and an equal amount of water in a saucepan over medium heat. Add chicken. Bring to a simmer and cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center, 3 to 5 minutes.
3. Heat 1 frozen, unopened bag of cauliflower and broccoli mix in the microwave until hot, 4 to 6 minutes. Let stand about 2 minutes; open bag and transfer vegetables to a bowl. Repeat with remaining bag.
4. Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add milk and salt; stir in remaining cream of mushroom soup. Add flour slowly, stirring constantly with a whisk to prevent lumps. Add Cheddar cheese. Cook and stir until cheese sauce is thick, 5 to 7 minutes. Add garlic powder.
5. Layer half the cooked vegetables into the bottom of a baking pan or casserole dish. Add half of the cooked chicken. Pour in half the cheese sauce. Add a light layer of bread crumbs. Add remaining vegetables, remaining chicken, and remaining cheese sauce. Top with a light layer of bread crumbs. Cover pan with aluminum foil.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling, 20 to 30 minutes.
