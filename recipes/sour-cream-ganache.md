## Ingredients

- 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
- 1 ½ cups sour cream
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Place chocolate chips into a glass or metal bowl, and set over the top of a pan of barely simmering water. Stir occasionally until melted and smooth. Remove from the heat and transfer chocolate to a medium bowl.
2. Add sour cream and vanilla; beat with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. If you let it cool down too much, it will set up; so frost your cake while it is still liquid, or reheat before using.
