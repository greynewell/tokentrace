## Ingredients

- 1 cup yellow cornmeal
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2  eggs
- 1  onion, chopped
- 1  green bell pepper, chopped
- 1 (4 ounce) jar diced pimentos, drained
- ⅓ cup vegetable oil

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
2. Stir together cornmeal, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. In another bowl, beat together the eggs, onion, green pepper, pimentos, vegetable oil, Cheddar cheese, cream-style corn, jalapeno pepper, crawfish tails, seasoned salt, cayenne pepper, and garlic powder until the mixture is well combined. Pour the crawfish mixture into the cornmeal mixture, and stir together. Pour the mixture into the prepared baking dish.
