## Ingredients

- 2 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ cups almond flour
- ½ cup white sugar
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 2 ¼ sticks unsalted butter, softened
- 3 large egg yolks
- ½ cup white sugar
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 3  vanilla beans

## Instructions

1. Stir all-purpose flour, almond flour, and 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar together in a bowl. Add butter and egg yolks; knead by hand until a smooth dough forms.
2. Divide dough into quarters and form each piece into a rectangle. Wrap each rectangle in plastic wrap. Chill dough in the refrigerator until firm, at least 1 hour, and up to overnight.
3. Place 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon white sugar in a food processor. Cut each vanilla bean in half lengthwise and scrape seeds from each half with the back of the knife; add to the sugar. Pulse until seeds are evenly dispersed. Pour vanilla sugar into a shallow bowl.
4. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper.
5. Cut 1 portion of dough into 6 equal pieces, keeping remaining dough chilled. Roll each piece evenly into a 1/2-inch-thick log on a lightly floured surface. Cut each log crosswise into 2-inch pieces and gently roll or pinch ends of each piece into points. Arrange cookies on the baking sheets.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until bottoms are lightly golden but tops are still pale, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from the oven and let stand for 2 minutes.
7. Roll warm cookies in the vanilla sugar, brushing off excess sugar. Transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool completely. Repeat with remaining dough, baking in batches.
