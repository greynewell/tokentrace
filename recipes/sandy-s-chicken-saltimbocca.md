## Ingredients

- 8 (6 ounce) chicken cutlets
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon black pepper
- 16  large fresh sage leaves
- 16 thin slices  prosciutto
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 cup dry white wine
- 1 cup low-sodium chicken broth
- ½ stick butter

## Instructions

1. If cutlets are thick, lay them between 2 sheets of wax paper and pound to 1/2-inch thickness with flat side of a meat mallet or bottom of a small, heavy skillet. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Put 2 large (or 5 small) sage leaves on top of each cutlet, then wrap 2 slices of prosciutto crosswise around each cutlet, holding sage in place.
2. Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add 4 cutlets and cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a platter; tent with foil to keep warm. Repeat with remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons oil and remaining 4 cutlets.
3. Add wine to skillet and simmer, scraping up any browned bits, 1 minute. Add broth and simmer until slightly reduced, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat, add butter, and swirl skillet until butter has melted and sauce is creamy. Spoon 2 tablespoons sauce over each cutlet and serve.
