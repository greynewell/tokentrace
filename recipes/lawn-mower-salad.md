## Ingredients

- ½ cup canola oil
- ½ cup white sugar
- ¼ cup water
- ¼ cup balsamic vinegar
- 2 (3 ounce) packages chicken-flavored ramen noodles, crushed, seasoning packets reserved
- 1 (12 ounce) package broccoli coleslaw mix
- 1 bunch green onions, sliced
- 1 cup roasted cashews
- ¼ cup roasted sunflower seed kernels

## Instructions

1. Whisk canola oil, sugar, water, balsamic vinegar, and seasoning packets from ramen noodles in a bowl until thoroughly combined and sugar and seasoning packets have dissolved.
