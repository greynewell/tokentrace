## Ingredients

- 1 bunch fresh asparagus, trimmed
- 4 (6 ounce) salmon fillets
- olive oil
- 1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ⅓ cup brown sugar, divided
- 5 ⅓ fluid ounces bourbon whiskey, divided
- ¼ cup non-dairy butter spread (such as I Can't Believe It's Not Butter®)

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Rinse asparagus under cold water and snip off the bottom of each sprout. Dry with a paper towel and lay flat on a baking sheet.
3. Rinse salmon; pat dry with paper towels. Lay salmon face-up on a separate baking sheet.
4. Drizzle olive oil over asparagus; season with salt and pepper and rub through and around the asparagus.
5. Bake asparagus in the preheated oven, turning over halfway, until lightly browned, about 20 minutes.
6. Rub about 2 tablespoons brown sugar over the salmon. Drizzle 1/2 the bourbon over salmon. Let marinate, 15 to 20 minutes.
7. Melt butter spread in a medium nonstick pan over medium-low heat. Add the remaining brown sugar; stir to dissolve. Add salmon fillets; cook until fish flakes easily with a fork, 5 to 7 minutes per side. Pour in the remaining bourbon during the last 2 minutes of cooking. Serve with the asparagus.
