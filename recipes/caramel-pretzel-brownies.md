## Ingredients

- 1 (14 ounce) bag individually wrapped caramels, unwrapped, divided
- 1 (19.8 ounce) package fudge brownie mix (such as Betty Crocker®)
- ½ cup vegetable oil
- ¼ cup water
- 2  eggs
- ¼ cup butter
- 1 tablespoon milk
- 1 cup chopped pretzels
- ¾ cup chocolate chips
- ⅓ cup chocolate-covered toffee bits

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Cut 9 caramels in half.
2. Beat brownie mix, vegetable oil, water, and eggs in a bowl until well combined. Pour batter into the prepared baking dish. Press three rows of 6 caramel halves into the brownie batter so there will be one in the center of each brownie.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out almost clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from the oven.
4. Combine remaining caramels, butter, and milk in a microwave-safe, glass or ceramic bowl. Microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring after each interval, until melted, 1 to 3 minutes (depending on your microwave).
5. Pour caramel mixture over warm brownies. Scatter pretzels, chocolate chips, and toffee bits over top. Cool for 20 minutes before cutting into 18 squares.
