## Ingredients

- 2 pounds beef pot roast, fat trimmed and discarded
- 3  potatoes, peeled and cut into 6 pieces
- 1 large onion, cut into 8 pieces
- 2  carrots, cut into 1-inch pieces
- 2 stalks celery, cut into 1-inch pieces
- 3 cups water
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 pinch garlic salt, or to taste
- ½ cup water
- 3 tablespoons cornstarch
- ½ teaspoon browning sauce (such as Gravy Master®)  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
2. Place roast in a large baking pan; arrange potatoes, onion, carrots, and celery around roast. Pour 3 cups water into the baking pan. Season roast with salt, pepper, and garlic salt. Cover pan with aluminum foil.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until roast is browned and cooked through, about 3 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the roast should read 145 degrees F (65 degrees C). Transfer roast to an oven-safe platter. Remove vegetables using a slotted spoon and arrange them around roast.
4. Reduce oven temperature to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Place the platter with roast and vegetables in the oven to keep warm.
5. Pour remaining pan juices into a saucepan; bring to a boil. Stir together remaining 1/2 cup water and cornstarch in a bowl until smooth; pour into boiling pan juices. Reduce heat to medium; cook, stirring constantly, until gravy is thick, about 5 minutes; season with salt and pepper. Stir in browning sauce.
