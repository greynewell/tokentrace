## Ingredients

- 1  whole chicken
- 1 pinch salt
- water to cover
- 1  lemon, halved
- 2 stalks celery, sliced
- 1 small onion, chopped
- 2  carrots, sliced, or more to taste
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Place chicken and 1 pinch salt in a large pot; cover with water. Bring to a boil, skimming any scum off the surface with a slotted spoon. Add lemon, celery, onion, and carrots. Simmer broth over medium heat until chicken starts to fall off the bone, about 1 hour.
2. Discard lemon. Remove chicken from the pot; let cool.
3. Place flour, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Make a well in the center. Ladle in 2 to 3 scoops of hot broth. Mix in flour with a spoon until dough comes together into a ball.
4. Turn dough out onto a floured surface. Knead carefully until smooth. Roll out into a large rectangle; cut into small rectangular dumplings.
5. Drop dumplings one at a time into the simmering broth. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 30 minutes.
6. Bone chicken and chop into pieces. Add to the pot; cook until heated through, about 5 minutes.
