## Ingredients

- 2 ½ cups milk
- 1 ½ cups arepas flour (such as P.A.N.®)
- ½ cup grated Monterey Jack cheese
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- ¼ cup unsalted butter, cut into pieces
- 1 tablespoon honey
- vegetable oil
- 1 (6 ounce) package cooked chicken, shredded, or to taste
- ½ (8 ounce) package Monterey Jack cheese, sliced, or to taste
- ½  avocado, sliced, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Bring milk to a simmer in a pot. Remove from heat and stir in butter.
2. Combine arepas flour, grated Monterey Jack cheese, kosher salt, and black pepper in a large bowl. Add the hot milk mixture and honey; stir until combined. Let mixture sit until milk is absorbed enough for a soft dough to form, 1 to 2 minutes. Dough will continue to stiffen.
3. Form dough into 12 balls about 2 inches in diameter. Flatten between palms into 3 1/2- to 4-inch arepa patties about 1/3-inch thick.
4. Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Fry 3 to 4 arepas at a time until lightly golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Slice each arepa in half crosswise and stuff a portion of chicken, sliced Monterey Jack cheese, and avocado between the halves.
