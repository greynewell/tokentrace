## Ingredients

- 3 cups uncooked elbow macaroni
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1  onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 small green bell pepper, finely chopped
- 1 (12 ounce) can corned beef
- 1 (10.75 ounce) can  condensed tomato soup
- ⅓ cup ketchup
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 cup freshly shredded Parmesan cheese

## Instructions

1. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the macaroni, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.
2. Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat, and cook the onion and garlic until the onion is soft, about 5 minutes; stir in the green pepper, and cook until tender, about 8 more minutes. Mash the corned beef into the pot, and simmer until hot. Mix in the tomato soup, ketchup, cooked macaroni, salt and black pepper; stir to combine, and bring the mixture to a simmer over medium-low heat. Sprinkle the Parmesan cheese on top, and serve.
