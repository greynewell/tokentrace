## Ingredients

- cooking spray (such as Pam®)
- ½ cup chopped pecans
- 1 (15.25 ounce) package yellow butter cake mix
- 1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
- 4  eggs
- ½ cup white sugar
- ½ cup vegetable oil (such as Wesson®)
- ¼ cup water
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
- ¼ teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
- ¼ teaspoon ground cloves
- 1 stick butter
- 1 cup white sugar
- ¼ cup water
- ¼ teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
- ½ cup rum (80 proof)

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
2. Coat the inside of a fluted tube pan (such as Bundt®) with cooking spray and sprinkle with chopped pecans.
3. Combine cake mix, pumpkin, eggs, sugar, oil, water, cinnamon, nutmeg, pumpkin pie spice, and cloves in a large bowl. Beat using an electric mixer until smooth and pour over nuts in the prepared tube pan. Tap the pan gently to release any air bubbles.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour.
5. Meanwhile, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in sugar, water, and pumpkin pie spice. Bring to a boil and cook for 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from heat and allow glaze to cool slightly, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in rum.
6. Remove cake from the oven and immediately turn out onto a plate. Poke small holes around the whole cake and quickly drizzle glaze over top and sides. Repeat using all of the glaze.
