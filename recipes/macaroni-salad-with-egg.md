## Ingredients

- 6 large eggs
- 1 (8 ounce) package shell pasta
- 1 ½ cups mayonnaise
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 3 tablespoons cider vinegar
- 1 ½ teaspoons white sugar
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt
- ¾ teaspoon ground paprika
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ teaspoon dry mustard
- 1 cup shredded carrot
- ¾ cup thinly sliced celery
- ¼ cup finely chopped onion

## Instructions

1. Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 15 minutes. Remove eggs from hot water, and cool under cold running water. Place in the refrigerator until ready to use.
2. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add shell pasta and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 9 minutes. Rinse pasta with cold water and drain thoroughly.
3. While pasta is cooking, combine mayonnaise, olive oil, cider vinegar, sugar, salt, paprika, pepper, and dry mustard in a large bowl. Mix in carrot, celery, and onion. Stir drained pasta into the dressing.
4. Remove eggs from the refrigerator. Shell, quarter lengthwise, and slice into 1/4-inch pieces. Gently stir into the macaroni salad. Refrigerate for 2 hours before serving.
