## Ingredients

- ½ cup unsalted butter
- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- ½ cup white sugar
- ½ cup packed brown sugar
- ¼ cup lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 (14.1 ounce) package 9-inch pie crusts
- 3 pounds Fuyu persimmons - peeled, cored, and sliced
- 1 tablespoon cinnamon sugar, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Melt butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add white sugar, brown sugar, lemon juice, and cinnamon; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until sugar is dissolved.
3. Line a 9-inch pie plate with 1 crust. Fill with sliced persimmons, mounding them slightly in the center. Pour sugar-butter mixture over the persimmons.
4. Sprinkle cinnamon sugar over the second pie crust. Cut into strips. Make an X with the 2 longest strips in the center of the pie. Alternate horizontal and vertical strips, weaving them in an over-and-under pattern. Use the shortest strips for the edges of the lattice.
5. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking until crust is golden brown, about 45 minutes more. Cool pie completely on a wire rack, about 2 hours.
