## Ingredients

- 1 cup salted butter, at room temperature
- ½ cup white sugar
- 2  eggs at room temperature, separated
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon almond extract
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- ⅛ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup shredded sweetened coconut
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- ¼ cup salted butter, softened
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon almond extract
- 1 cup powdered sugar
- ½ cup shredded sweetened coconut, or to taste
- 1 cup finely chopped pecans

## Instructions

1. Combine butter and sugar in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer on high speed until creamy, about 2 minutes. Add egg yolks, vanilla, and almond extract; beat until combined. Add flour and salt; mix until just combined. Stir in coconut, making sure it is evenly distributed throughout the dough. Refrigerate dough for about 30 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, make the frosting. Beat cream cheese and butter together until creamy. Add vanilla and almond extract, then gradually stir in powdered sugar until frosting is creamy. Stir in coconut. Refrigerate icing to infuse the flavors, about 30 minutes.
3. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.
4. Beat egg whites in a small bowl until bubbly and frothy. Pour pecans into a shallow bowl.
5. Shape the cookies by rolling the cold dough into 1-inch balls. Dip dough into the egg whites then roll in the pecans until covered. Arrange on the prepared baking sheets. Gently press down with your thumb to make a small well in the center of each cookie.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until slightly firm, about 15 minutes. Allow to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes to firm up. Move cookies to a wire rack. Cool completely before filling with frosting.
