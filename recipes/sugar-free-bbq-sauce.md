## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon canola oil
- 1 cup minced onion
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2  beef bouillon cubes
- ½ cup hot water
- 3 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste
- 1 cup granular sucrolose sweetener (such as Splenda®)
- ¾ cup Worcestershire sauce
- ¾ cup Dijon mustard
- 3 tablespoons hickory-flavored liquid smoke
- 1 teaspoon salt

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat, cook and stir until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Mix beef bouillon cubes and water in a cup until cubes are softened and beginning to dissolve, and pour water and bouillon cubes into the saucepan. Bring to a simmer, stirring to dissolve the cubes. Mix in tomato paste, sucralose sweetener, Worcestershire sauce, Dijon mustard, liquid smoke flavoring, salt, cider vinegar, and hot pepper sauce. Stir until sweetener has dissolved.
