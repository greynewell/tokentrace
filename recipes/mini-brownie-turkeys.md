## Ingredients

- nonstick cooking spray (such as BakeEasy®)
- ¼ cup butter, softened
- ½ cup white sugar
- 1  egg
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- 3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
- ⅛ teaspoon baking powder
- ⅛ teaspoon salt
- 3 tablespoons butter, softened
- 3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 ½ tablespoons milk
- 1 cup powdered sugar
- 12  red candy-coated chocolate pieces (such as M&M's®)
- 60  candy corn, or as needed
- 24  candy eyeballs

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 12-cup mini muffin tin with cooking spray.
2. Cream 1/4 cup butter and sugar together in a bowl with an electric mixer. Add egg and vanilla extract; mix well. Stir flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt together in a separate bowl. Add flour mixture to butter mixture and mix until batter is smooth. Divide batter evenly among the prepared muffin cups.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 14 minutes. Cool in the tin for 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool, about 20 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, combine butter, cocoa powder, and milk in a bowl and mix with an electric mixer until smooth. Gradually add powdered sugar and mix until frosting is smooth and fluffy.
5. Spoon frosting in a piping bag fitted with a Wilton #10 tip. Pipe a circle of frosting near the bottom half of each mini brownie to create the turkey's head. Add two candy eyes. Add 1 red chocolate piece to form the beak. Pipe 5 lines of frosting in the shape of a semi-circle formation coming up from the head. Place a piece of candy corn on each of the 5 lines to form the turkey's feathers.
