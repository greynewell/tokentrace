## Ingredients

- ⅓ cup olive oil
- 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar
- 1 ½ tablespoons lemon juice
- 1 ½ tablespoons white sugar
- 1 ½ tablespoons grated onion
- 1 ½ teaspoons seasoned salt
- 1 ½ teaspoons dried basil
- 2 ½ cups water

- 4  skinless, boneless chicken breasts
- ¼ cup chopped onion

## Instructions

1. Whisk olive oil, red wine vinegar, lemon juice, sugar, grated onion, seasoned salt, and basil together in a bowl to make dressing. Transfer to the refrigerator.
