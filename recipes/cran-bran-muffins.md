## Ingredients

- 1 ¼ cups wheat bran
- ⅓ cup dark brown sugar
- ¾ cup whole milk
- ⅔ cup grapeseed oil
- 2 large eggs
- 1 tablespoon molasses
- 1  orange, zested
- 1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour
- ½ cup white sugar
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 ½ cups fresh cranberries

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin or line cups with paper liners.
2. Combine bran and brown sugar in a large bowl.
3. Pour milk into a microwave-safe glass measuring cup. Heat until almost boiling, about 1 minute. Pour over the bran mixture. Beat with an electric mixer until combined. Let stand until milk is mostly absorbed, about 5 minutes.
4. Beat oil, eggs, molasses, and orange zest into the bran mixture.
5. Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon in a small bowl. Mix into the batter until just combined. Sprinkle cranberries on top; fold in with a spatula. Divide batter among the prepared muffin cups.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes.
