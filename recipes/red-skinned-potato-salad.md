## Ingredients

- 2 pounds clean, scrubbed new red potatoes
- 6  eggs
- 1 pound bacon
- 1  onion, finely chopped
- 1 stalk celery, finely chopped
- 2 cups mayonnaise
- salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain and set in the refrigerator to cool.
2. Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Cover and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove eggs from hot water; cool in ice water. Peel, then chop into small, bite-sized pieces.
3. Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels, then crumble.
4. Chop cooled potatoes, leaving skin on. Add to a large bowl, along with eggs, bacon, onion, and celery. Stir in mayonnaise, salt, and pepper. Chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour before serving.
