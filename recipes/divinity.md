## Ingredients

- 2 ⅔ cups white sugar
- ⅔ cup light corn syrup
- ½ cup water
- 2  egg whites
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ⅔ cup chopped walnuts  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Heat sugar, corn syrup, and water in a 2-quart saucepan over low heat; stir continuously until sugar is dissolved and mixture comes to a boil. Continue to cook, without stirring, until the mixture reaches 250 degrees F (120 degrees C) or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a rigid ball.
2. Beat egg whites in a 1-1/2-quart glass, metal, or ceramic bowl until stiff peaks form. Continue to beat while slowly pouring hot syrup in a thin stream into egg whites. Add vanilla; beat until mixture holds its shape and begins to lose its gloss. Fold in walnuts.
3. Drop from a greased spoon onto waxed paper. Let stand at room temperature, turning candy over once, until the outside of candy is firm, at least 12 hours. Store in an airtight container.
