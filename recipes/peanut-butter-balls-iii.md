## Ingredients

- 2 cups creamy peanut butter
- ½ cup butter
- 4 cups confectioners' sugar
- 3 cups crisp rice cereal
- 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. Melt peanut butter and butter in saucepan over low heat, stirring often.
2. Mix crisp rice cereal and confectioners' sugar in a large bowl until all well combined. Pour melted peanut butter mixture over top and stir until thoroughly blended; mixture will still appear crumbly but will easily form into balls.
3. Form into 1-inch diameter (or smaller) balls and place onto parchment-lined cookie sheets. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, 3 hours to overnight.
4. When ready to coat the balls, melt chocolate chips in double boiler. Keep over the lowest heat to keep melted.
5. Place a peanut butter ball into the melted chocolate. Use two forks to roll it around until fully coated. Carefully remove it, letting any excess chocolate drip back into the pot, and place it on a wire rack set over a piece of parchment paper. Repeat to coat remaining balls.
6. Refrigerate coated peanut butter balls until completely firm before serving.
