## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups whole unskinned almonds, lightly toasted
- 1 ½ cups confectioners' sugar
- 1 large fresh egg white, at room temperature, lightly beaten, or more as needed
- ¼ teaspoon almond extract

## Instructions

1. Place almonds and confectioners' sugar in the bowl of a food processor; process to a meal-like consistency, scraping down the sides and over the bottom of the bowl as needed. Don't overprocess it--at this point, the mixture should still be crumbly, not paste-like.
2. Add egg white and almond extract; process until it lumps together. If it remains crumbly, add more egg white, a few drops at a time.
3. Use a silicone spatula to remove almond paste from the food processor. It not using it right away, wrap it in waxed paper and store in an airtight container to use within a few hours. Or, place the wrapped almond paste in a freezer bag and freeze for up to six months.
