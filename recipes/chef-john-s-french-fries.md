## Ingredients

- 1  russet potato, cut into evenly sized strips
- 1 quart vegetable oil for frying
- salt to taste

## Instructions

1. Soak potato strips in a large bowl of water for about 30 minutes. Pat with paper towels until thoroughly dry.
2. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Gently add potatoes to the hot oil and fry for about 5 minutes, stirring and flipping the potatoes occasionally. Use a slotted spoon to transfer potatoes to a paper towel-lined plate. Let cool completely.
