## Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ½ cup lemon yogurt
- 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for kneading
- ⅓ cup white sugar
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- ½ cup cold butter, cut into cubes
- 2 tablespoons butter, melted
- 1  egg, beaten
- 1 ½ teaspoons lavender flowers
- 1 teaspoon lemon zest
- 1 tablespoon butter, melted, or as needed
- 1 teaspoon white sugar, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Stir baking soda and yogurt together in a bowl.
3. Sift flour, 1/3 cup sugar, and baking powder together in a bowl. Cut cold butter into flour mixture using a pastry cutter or two forks until mixture is crumbly.
4. Mix yogurt mixture, 2 tablespoons melted butter, egg, lavender, and lemon zest in a separate bowl. Stir yogurt-lavender mixture into flour mixture until just moistened.
5. Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead 8 to 10 times, adding more flour if dough is too sticky.
6. Divide dough into 2 pieces and place on an ungreased baking sheet. Pat and shape each piece into a 6-inch circle. Score each circle into 6 wedges using a sharp floured knife. Brush tops with 1 tablespoon melted butter; sprinkle with 1 teaspoon white sugar.
7. Bake in the preheated oven until scones are just golden, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from oven, break into wedges, and cool on a wire rack.
