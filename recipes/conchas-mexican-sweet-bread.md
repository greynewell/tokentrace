## Ingredients

- 2 ½ teaspoons yeast
- ½ cup warm water
- ½ cup evaporated milk
- ⅜ cup white sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ⅓ cup butter or margarine, melted
- 1  egg
- 4 cups all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ⅔ cup white sugar
- ½ cup butter or margarine
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Make bread: Stir together warm water and yeast in a large bowl. Mix in 2 cups flour, milk, sugar, melted butter, egg, and salt until combined. Gradually mix in remaining 2 cups flour and cinnamon until dough comes together.
2. Turn dough out onto a floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, 6 to 8 minutes. Place in a large greased bowl; turn dough to coat. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.
3. Meanwhile, make topping: Beat sugar and butter in a medium bowl until light and fluffy. Stir in flour until a thick paste forms. Transfer 1/2 of the paste to a separate bowl. Mix cinnamon into one half and vanilla into the other half.
4. Divide dough into 12 equal pieces. Shape into balls and place 3 inches apart on a greased cookie sheet.
5. Divide each bowl of topping into 6 balls; pat flat. Place circles of topping on top of dough balls, patting down lightly. Use a knife to cut grooves in the topping like a clam shell. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes.
6. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
7. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden brown, about 20 minutes.
