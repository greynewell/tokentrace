## Ingredients

- 2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 large egg
- 1 cup white sugar
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly
- 1 ¼ cups sour cream
- 1 ½ cups fresh blueberries
- cooking spray
- ¾ cup white sugar, divided
- 1 teaspoon lemon zest
- ¼ cup lemon juice

## Instructions

1. Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
2. Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl until combined.
3. Whisk egg in a second medium bowl until well combined and light-colored, about 20 seconds. Add sugar and whisk vigorously until thick and homogenous, about 30 seconds; add melted butter in 2 or 3 additions, whisking to combine after each addition. Add sour cream in 2 additions, whisking just to combine.
4. Add blueberries to the dry ingredients and gently toss just to combine. Add sour cream mixture and fold with a rubber spatula until the batter comes together and the berries are evenly distributed, 25 to 30 seconds. Small spots of flour may remain, and the batter will be thick. Don't overmix.
5. Using a large spoon sprayed with nonstick cooking spray to prevent sticking, spread the batter evenly into the greased loaf pan.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until the top is light brown and a toothpick or skewer inserted into the center of the bread comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Rotate the pan from front to back halfway through the baking time. Let cool for 5 minutes.
7. While bread is cooling, mix 1/2 cup sugar and lemon zest together in a small bowl. Set aside.
8. Bring lemon juice and remaining 1/4 cup sugar to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium heat; stir to dissolve the sugar and simmer until the mixture is thick and syrupy and reduced to about 1/4 cup. Brush the top of the bread with glaze, then sprinkle the lemon sugar onto the glaze.
