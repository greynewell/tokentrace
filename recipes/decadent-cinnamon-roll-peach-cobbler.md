## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- ½ cup packed brown sugar
- ½ cup butter, cubed
- ¼ teaspoon Georgia peach spice (such as Savory Spice Shop®)
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 2 (15.25 ounce) cans sliced peaches in juice, drained and juice reserved
- ½ cup white sugar
- ¼ cup cornstarch
- 1 teaspoon Georgia peach spice (such as Savory Spice Shop®)
- 1 cup frozen peaches, thawed
- 1 (12.4 ounce) package refrigerated cinnamon roll dough with icing

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a 9x9-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
2. Pulse flour, brown sugar, butter, peach spice, and salt together in a food processor until the mixture resembles pea-sized crumbs. Press mixture into the bottom of the prepared baking dish.
3. Bake crust in the preheated oven until golden and set, about 15 minutes.
4. While crust is baking, heat a saucepan over medium heat. Pour reserved peach juice into the saucepan; stir in sugar, cornstarch, and peach spice until smooth. Bring to a boil; cook and stir until thickened, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in canned and frozen peaches.
5. Remove crust from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes. Pour peach mixture into the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling, about 20 minutes.
7. Meanwhile, combine cinnamon rolls together to form a square pastry disc. Roll out disc with a rolling pin on a lightly floured work surface. Cut into thin strips using a pizza cutter. Weave strips together to create a lattice topping.
8. Remove the baking dish from the oven; lay lattice over the peaches. Increase oven temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
9. Bake cobbler in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 12 minutes. Drizzle the included cinnamon roll icing over the lattice crust. Serve warm.
