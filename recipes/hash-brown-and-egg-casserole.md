## Ingredients

- 1 (2 pound) package frozen hash brown potatoes, thawed
- 1 pound pork sausage
- 1 small onion, diced
- 5  eggs
- ½ cup milk
- ½ teaspoon onion powder
- ⅛ teaspoon garlic powder
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 12 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square pan; add hash brown potatoes and arrange in an even layer.
2. Place sausage and onion in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir until the sausage is browned and crumbled, about 10 minutes; drain.
3. Meanwhile, whisk eggs, milk, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl until well combined; pour over the potatoes and sprinkle with 1/2 of the Cheddar cheese. Add sausage mixture on top and sprinkle with remaining Cheddar. Cover with aluminum foil.
4. Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour. Remove foil; return casserole to the oven and bake until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, about 10 minutes. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving.
