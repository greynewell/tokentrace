## Ingredients

- 12 small red potatoes, quartered
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 pinch garlic powder, or to taste
- 1 pinch dried oregano, or to taste
- ½ cup light butter-flavored spread (such as I Can't Believe It's Not Butter ® Light)

## Instructions

1. Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray four sheets of aluminum foil with cooking spray.
2. Divide potatoes evenly among the sheets of aluminum foil; season with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and oregano. Place 2 tablespoons of the butter flavored spread over each mound of potatoes. Create packets by folding and sealing the aluminum foil. Place the foil packets on a baking sheet.
