## Ingredients

- 4  large egg whites egg whites, at room temperature
- ¼ teaspoon cream of tartar
- Pinch salt
- 1 cup sugar
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 1 tablespoon white vinegar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 2 cups whipping cream
- 2 tablespoons orange liqueur
- 4 cups strawberries

## Instructions

1. Beat egg whites, cream of tartar and salt in a large bowl with an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Beat in sugar, 1 tbsp at a time, until stiff, glossy peaks form. Beat in cornstarch, vinegar and vanilla just until blended.
2. On a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or foil, spread meringue into a 10-inch (25 cm) circle with a raised edge and a slight indentation in the centre.
3. Bake in a preheated 250 degrees F (120 degrees C) oven until firm to the touch, about 1-1/4 hours. Meringue should be cream-coloured. If it appears to be browning, reduce oven temperature to 225 degrees F (105 degrees C).
4. Remove from oven and let cool.
5. When ready to serve, peel parchment paper off back of meringue. Place meringue on a serving plate. Cut strawberries into halves or slices, if large. Whip cream until stiff peaks form. Gently stir in liqueur, if using. Spread whipped cream over meringue leaving edge of meringue visible. Top with strawberries. Cut into wedges to serve.
