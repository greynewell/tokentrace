## Ingredients

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 4 tablespoons white sugar, divided
- 1 ½ teaspoons baking powder
- ⅛ teaspoon baking soda
- ⅛ teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1  egg
- ¼ cup buttermilk
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- ¼ cup fresh blueberries
- 2 teaspoons orange zest

## Instructions

1. Preheat the air fryer to 360 degrees F (180 degrees C).
2. Stir together flour, 2 tablespoons sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl. Cut in butter with two knives or pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
3. Beat egg with a fork in a small bowl. Remove 2 tablespoons egg to another small bowl; set aside. Add buttermilk and vanilla extract to remaining egg; whisk with the fork until combined. Stir into flour mixture until just moistened. Gently stir in blueberries.
4. Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface. Gently knead until dough is no longer sticky, about 8 to 10 strokes. Pat dough into a 6-inch circle. Cut into 8 wedges, without separating, dipping the knife in flour between cuts.
5. Combine remaining 2 tablespoons sugar and orange zest in a small bowl. Brush top of dough with reserved egg and sprinkle with sugar mixture. Separate dough wedges and carefully arrange them, using a small wide spatula, in a single layer in the fryer basket, in batches if necessary.
6. Cook scones until golden brown, about 6 minutes. Serve warm.
