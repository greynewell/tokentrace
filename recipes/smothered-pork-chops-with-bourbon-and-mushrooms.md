## Ingredients

- 4 (8 ounce) center-cut pork chops
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 cups thinly sliced onion
- 1 (8 ounce) package thinly sliced baby bella mushrooms
- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- ¼ cup bourbon
- 1 ½ cups beef broth
- ½ cup heavy cream
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Season pork chops with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat. Add pork chops; cook until browned, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Place browned chops in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Wipe out any residual oil from the pan.
3. Melt butter in the same pan over medium heat. Add onion, mushrooms, and sugar. Cook and stir for 1 minute. Cover pan and reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer mixture until onions are softened, about 10 minutes. Uncover pan and stir the mixture, scraping up browned bits from the bottom. Continue cooking onions for about 3 minutes more.
4. Pour bourbon into the onion mixture; cook until mostly evaporated, 3 to 4 minutes. Add broth and cream; bring to a simmer. Cook for 10 minutes; pour over the browned chops in the baking dish. Cover with aluminum foil.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the pork reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), 25 to 30 minutes.
