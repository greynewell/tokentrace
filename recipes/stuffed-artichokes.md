## Ingredients

- 6  whole artichokes
- 3 slices Italian bread, cubed
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- ⅛ cup chopped fresh parsley
- ¼ cup grated Romano cheese
- ½ teaspoon dried oregano
- 5 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
- salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Snip the pointed tips of artichoke leaves, and cut off the stems. Wash and drain. Holding artichoke firmly by base, firmly rap the top of it on a hard surface; this will open it so it can be stuffed.
2. In a medium bowl combine bread cubes, garlic, parsley, Romano cheese, oregano, 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, salt and pepper; mix well.
3. Press about 1/2 cup of stuffing into each artichoke. Tightly pack stuffed artichokes together in a large heavy saucepan or Dutch oven. Add enough water to reach half way up artichokes and add 3 tablespoons oil.
4. Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, for 1 hour, or until leaves pull out easily.
