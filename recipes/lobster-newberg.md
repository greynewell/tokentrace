## Ingredients

- 4 (4 ounce) lobster tails, split in half
- salt to taste
- 2 tablespoons clarified butter
- 2 tablespoons sherry wine
- ½ cup heavy whipping cream
- 2  large egg yolks
- 1 pinch freshly grated nutmeg
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Season lobster tails with salt.
2. Heat clarified butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place tails, meat-side down, in hot butter, and sauté until just cooked through, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate to cool.
3. Pour sherry into the skillet and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon. Cook until sherry is reduced by half, about 1 minute. Remove skillet from heat.
4. Pull meat from shells; discard shells and roughly chop lobster meat. Pour any accumulated juices from the plate into sherry mixture in the skillet.
5. Whisk cream, egg yolks, nutmeg, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl.
6. Whisk cream mixture into sherry mixture, return skillet to medium-low heat, and cook, stirring constantly, until sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, 3 to 7 minutes. Stir lobster into sauce and cook until heated through. Season with parsley and salt.
