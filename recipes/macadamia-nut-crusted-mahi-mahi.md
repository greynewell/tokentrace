## Ingredients

- 2 ounces macadamia nuts
- 4 ounces plain bread crumbs
- 6 (6 ounce) mahi mahi fillets
- 4 ounces butter
- 2 ounces shallots, diced
- 4 cups chicken stock
- 4 ounces pineapple, rough chopped
- 4 ounces papaya, rough chopped
- 4 ounces mango, rough chopped
- 1 tablespoon shredded coconut
- 2  habanero peppers, seeded
- salt and pepper to taste
- white sugar to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. In a food processor or blender, pulse together macadamia nuts and breadcrumbs until finely ground. Pour nut mixture onto a plate, and coat fish fillets on both sides.
3. Heat butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry fillets on both sides until nuts are golden brown. Remove to a baking pan.
