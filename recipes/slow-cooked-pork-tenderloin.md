## Ingredients

- ½ cup olive oil
- ½ cup balsamic vinegar
- 3 cloves garlic, peeled
- 3 tablespoons brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme
- 1 teaspoon dry mustard
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1 (4 pound) pork tenderloin
- ¼ cup dry sherry
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch
- 2 tablespoons water

## Instructions

1. Place olive oil, balsamic vinegar, garlic, brown sugar, thyme, dry mustard, and paprika into a food processor; blend until combined. Pour marinade into a resealable plastic bag. Add pork tenderloin to the bag, seal, and marinate in the refrigerator for 24 hours.
