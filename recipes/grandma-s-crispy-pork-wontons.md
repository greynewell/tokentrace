## Ingredients

- 1 pound ground pork
- 1 cup diced celery
- 1 cup shredded carrot
- 1 cup diced onion
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon ground black pepper
- ¼ cup soy sauce
- 1 (14 ounce) package wonton wrappers
- 2  eggs, beaten
- 1 quart canola oil for frying

## Instructions

1. Mix together the ground pork, celery, carrot, onion, and garlic in a bowl. Season with salt, pepper, and soy sauce; mix with your hands until well blended.
2. Separate the wonton wrappers and lay them out on a clean surface. Spoon 1 teaspoon of the pork mixture into the center of each wrapper. Moisten the edges of the wonton wrappers with beaten egg, fold over the filling to form a triangle, and press together to seal. Place the finished wontons on a baking sheet.
3. Heat the canola oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 365 degrees F (180 degrees C).
4. Fry the wontons, about 6 at a time, until they turn golden brown and float to the top, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove, and drain on a paper towel-lined plate.
