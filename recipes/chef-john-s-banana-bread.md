## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ½ cup butter, softened
- 3  ripe bananas, mashed
- 1 cup white sugar
- 2  large eggs
- ¼ teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 tablespoon milk

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Coat a 9x4-inch loaf pan with cooking spray.
2. Whisk flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda together in a bowl.
3. Beat butter and sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Add mashed bananas and beat until combined. Beat eggs into the butter mixture one at a time, fully blending each egg before adding the next. Stir vanilla extract and milk into the mixture.
