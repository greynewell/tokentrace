## Ingredients

- 1 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 1 cup milk
- ¼ cup coconut milk
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 2 cups cake flour
- 1 cup white sugar
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 5  egg yolks
- 2 cups white sugar
- ½ (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk (such as Carnation®)
- ½ cup unsalted butter, softened
- 3  egg yolks
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 4 cups pecans, very finely chopped

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 8-inch round cake pans.
2. Mix butter, milk, coconut milk, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl. Combine flour, sugar, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt in a separate bowl. Slowly mix into the milk mixture. Add egg yolks one at a time, beating well after each addition.
3. Divide batter between the prepared cake pans.
4. Bake cakes in the preheated oven until tops are golden yellow and spring back when lightly pressed, 25 to 30 minutes.
5. Prepare frosting while cakes are baking. Combine sugar, evaporated milk, butter, egg yolks, and flour in a saucepan. Heat over medium-low, stirring constantly, until mixture starts to thicken. Add vanilla and stir for 1 minute. Pour in pecans; cook and stir for 2 minutes more.
6. Remove frosting from heat and let cool. Remove cakes from the oven and set aside to cool, 20 to 30 minutes.
7. Place 1 cooled cake layer on a serving plate. Cover with some of the cooled frosting. Top with the second cake layer. Frost top and sides with remaining frosting.
