## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 cup unprocessed wheat bran
- ¾ cup lightly packed brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup milk
- ½ cup vegetable oil
- 2  eggs
- 2 large apples - peeled, cored, and chopped
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- ¼ cup packed brown sugar
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 2 tablespoons cold butter

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners.
2. Make muffins: Whisk flour, bran, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt together in a large bowl until thoroughly combined.
3. Whisk milk, vegetable oil, and eggs together in a separate bowl. Pour milk mixture into flour mixture and stir just until combined. Gently stir in apples. Fill the prepared muffin cups about 3/4 full.
4. Make streusel: Mix flour, brown sugar, and cinnamon in a bowl. Cut in butter until mixture is crumbly. Sprinkle about 1 heaping teaspoon on top of each muffin.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes.
