## Ingredients

- ¼ cup lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon cornstarch
- 1 (16 ounce) package frozen strawberries
- 2 cups soy milk
- ⅔ cup white sugar
- 1 (1 gram) packet granular sucrolose sweetener (such as Splenda®), or to taste
- ⅛ teaspoon citric acid powder (sour salt), or to taste

## Instructions

1. Mix lemon juice and cornstarch together in a small bowl and pour into a blender. Add strawberries, soy milk, sugar, sweetener, and salt; blend until smooth.
2. Pour mixture into a pot. Heat over medium heat, stirring frequently to keep from burning, until mixture comes to a boil and starts to thicken, 10 to 15 minutes. Cover and chill thoroughly, 8 hours to overnight.
3. Pour mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer's instructions, in 2 batches if necessary, about 20 minutes. Transfer to an airtight container and freeze until firm, about 4 hours.
