## Ingredients

- ½ cup chopped dark chocolate
- 1 cup white sugar
- ¼ cup butter
- 2  eggs
- 2  egg yolks
- 1 cup vegetable oil
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- ⅓ cup sour cream
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- ½ cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ cup water
- 2 cups shortening
- ½ cup half-and-half
- 5 cups confectioners' sugar
- 8  chocolate sandwich cookies (such as Oreo®)

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a deep 10-inch round cake pan.
2. Melt chocolate in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 15-second intervals, stirring after each interval, 1 to 3 minutes. Let cool.
3. Combine sugar and butter in a medium bowl. Beat with an electric mixer until fluffy and well combined. Mix in cooled chocolate. Beat in eggs and egg yolks, one at a time. Mix in 1 cup plus 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, sour cream, and vanilla extract until smooth.
4. Sift flour, cocoa powder, salt, and baking soda together in a different bowl. Add flour mixture to batter in 3 additions, mixing well after each addition. Beat in water. Pour batter into the prepared pan.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 19 minutes. Immediately invert onto a cooling rack and let cool.
6. Meanwhile, whip shortening with an electric mixer until creamy, about 5 minutes. Beat in cream until smooth, about 5 minutes. Add confectioners' sugar; beat on high speed until frosting is light and fluffy, 7 to 10 minutes.
7. Spread frosting over the top and sides of the cooled cake. Cut 4 cookies into quarters using a sharp knife. Arrange quartered cookies around the top edge of the cake. Crush remaining 4 cookies; press crumbs against the sides of the cake.
