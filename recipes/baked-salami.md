## Ingredients

- 1 (2 pound) whole salami, casing removed
- 1 cup brown sugar
- 1 (16 ounce) bottle prepared barbecue sauce

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a baking dish with aluminum foil.
2. Partially slice salami into 1/4-inch-thick slices, making sure the cuts do not go all the way through. Place salami into the prepared baking dish.
3. Bake salami for 1 hour. Drain off grease.
4. Mix brown sugar and barbecue sauce together in a bowl, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Pour about 2 cups sauce over salami; reserve the remainder for basting.
5. Return salami to the oven and bake for 45 minutes more, basting occasionally with reserved sauce.
6. Serve baked salami on a platter with a knife so guests can cut their own slices.
