## Ingredients

- 12 medium sea scallops
- 1 teaspoon salt, or more to taste
- 5 tablespoons clarified butter (ghee), warm
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 3 tablespoons clarified butter (ghee)

## Instructions

1. Place scallops in a bowl and sprinkle with salt. Cover and let rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
2. Combine 5 tablespoons warm butter, lemon juice, and garlic in a bowl; whisk until combined. Let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.
3. At the same time, remove scallops from the refrigerator and let come to room temperature, about 20 to 30 minutes.
4. Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a nonstick pan over medium-high heat, making sure it does not smoke. Brush scallops with garlic mixture and add to the pan. Cook until the bottoms begin to sear and turn golden, about 2 minutes. Flip scallops, brush with garlic mixture, and cook another 2 minutes. Remove scallops from the heat and let them continue to cook while they rest, off the heat, for 5 more minutes. Plate and serve.
