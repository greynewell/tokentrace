## Ingredients

- ½ cup butter
- 1 small carrot, finely diced
- 1 stalk celery, diced
- 1 small onion, finely diced
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- ½ cup all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ cups white corn kernels
- 1 ½ cups yellow corn kernels
- 4  russet potatoes, diced
- 2  cooked rotisserie chicken breast halves, shredded
- 4 cups chicken stock, divided
- 2 ½ cups half-and-half
- 1 pinch nutmeg
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir onion, carrot, celery, and garlic in hot butter until slightly softened, about 2 minutes. Stir flour into mixture to make a paste; cook until lightly browned and flour gives off a slightly toasted smell, about 5 minutes. Watch carefully as flour burns easily. Remove saucepan from heat and set aside to cool slightly.
2. Meanwhile, stir together potatoes, chicken, white and yellow corn, and 3 cups stock in a large soup pot over medium heat.
3. Whisk remaining 1 cup stock into vegetables and flour mixture until thoroughly combined. Stir mixture into the soup pot; bring to a simmer. Cook and stir until thick, about 5 minutes.
4. Stir half-and-half, nutmeg, salt, and black pepper into chowder. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes.
