## Ingredients

- ½ cup gluten-free sourdough starter discard
- 1 cup gluten-free all-purpose baking flour
- ½ teaspoon fine sea salt
- 10 tablespoons non-chlorinated water, or more if needed
- 1 teaspoon vegetable oil
- 1 teaspoon water
- 2 teaspoons sesame seeds

## Instructions

1. Line an 8x4x2 1/2-inch loaf pan with parchment paper.
2. Mix sourdough starter discard, flour, and salt in a stand mixer on low speed. Add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until dough is combined and comes together. Add only enough water to create a cross between a dough and a thick batter; the amount you need will depend on the types of flours in your mix. Use a rubber scraper to pour the dough into the lined loaf pan. Cover loosely with plastic wrap.
3. Put into the cold oven to rise overnight, or for up to 12 hours. Remove loaf from the oven. Mix 1 teaspoon oil and water and sprinkle on top of the risen loaf. Top evenly with sesame seeds.
4. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
5. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Reduce heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) and continue baking until the internal temperature reaches 190 degrees F (87 degrees C), about 20 minutes more.
6. Remove bread from the oven and allow to cool for 5 minutes. Remove from the loaf pan, peel off the parchment paper, and cool on a cooling rack. Wait until completely cooled before slicing.
