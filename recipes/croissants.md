## Ingredients

- 1 ¼ teaspoons active dry yeast
- 3 tablespoons warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- 1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons white sugar
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt
- ⅔ cup warm milk
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- ⅔ cup unsalted butter, chilled
- 1  egg
- 1 tablespoon water

## Instructions

1. Combine warm water, yeast, and 1 teaspoon sugar in a small bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.
2. Measure flour into a mixing bowl. Combine warm milk, 2 teaspoons sugar, and salt in a separate bowl; blend milk mixture, yeast mixture, and oil into flour. Mix well and knead until smooth. Cover, and let rise until over tripled in volume, about 3 hours.
3. Deflate gently, and let rise again until doubled, about another 3 hours.
4. Deflate dough and chill for 20 minutes.
5. Massage butter until pliable, but not soft and oily. Pat dough into a 14x8-inch rectangle. Smear butter over top two-thirds, leaving a 1/4-inch margin all around. Fold unbuttered third over middle third, and buttered top third down over that. Turn 90 degrees, so that folds are to left and right. Roll out to a 14x6-inch rectangle. Fold in three again. Sprinkle lightly with flour, and put dough in a resealable plastic bag. Refrigerate for 2 hours.
6. Unwrap, sprinkle with flour, and deflate gently. Roll to a 14x6-inch rectangle, and fold again. Turn 90 degrees, and repeat. Wrap and chill 2 hours.
7. Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C).
8. To shape, roll dough out to a 20x5-inch rectangle. Cut in half crosswise, and chill half while shaping the other half. Roll out to a 15x5-inch rectangle. Cut into three 5x5-inch squares. Cut each square in half diagonally. Roll each triangle lightly to elongate the point, and make it 7 inches long. Grab the other 2 points, and stretch them out slightly as you roll it up. Place on a baking sheet, curving slightly. Let shaped croissants rise until puffy and light.
9. In a small bowl, beat together egg and 1 tablespoon water. Glaze croissants with egg wash.
10. Bake in the preheated oven until crisp, flaky, and golden brown, about 12 to 15 minutes.
