## Ingredients

- ½ cup butter
- ½ cup hot pepper sauce
- 2 teaspoons distilled white vinegar
- 2 cups shredded cooked chicken
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- 1 (12 ounce) package wonton wrappers
- 1  egg white
- 2 cups oil for frying

## Instructions

1. Melt the butter over medium-high heat in a small saucepan.
2. Remove from heat; whisk the hot pepper sauce and vinegar into the hot butter.
3. When mixture is smooth, set sauce aside and allow to rest for 1 hour to cool and thicken.
4. Stir the shredded chicken into the cooled buffalo sauce, and let stand 15 minutes.
5. Lay out several wonton wrappers, place 1/2 teaspoon chicken in the center of each wrapper and top with 1/2 teaspoon cream cheese.
6. Brush the edges of the wonton wrappers with egg white, fold them over the filling in a triangle shape and press the edged together to seal.
7. Continue until all of the wontons are filled.
8. Heat the oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
9. Cook the wontons, carefully placing the wontons 4 to 5 at a time into the hot oil and deep fry until golden brown, flipping as necessary for even browning, about 2 minutes.
10. Remove the wontons from the oil and drain on paper towel.
