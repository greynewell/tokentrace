## Ingredients

- ¼ cup warm water
- 1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
- ¾ cup lukewarm milk
- ¼ cup white sugar
- ¼ cup vegetable shortening (such as Crisco®)
- 1  egg, beaten
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 3 ½ cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed
- ½ cup brown sugar
- ¼ cup butter, softened
- 1  egg
- ¼ cup milk
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- ½ teaspoon lemon extract
- 2 cups finely chopped walnuts

## Instructions

1. Make bread dough: Combine warm water and yeast together in a large bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and forms a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.
2. Stir lukewarm milk, white sugar, shortening, egg, and salt into yeast mixture. Mix in flour until a soft, easy-to-handle dough forms.
3. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and let stand for 10 minutes. Knead dough until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Form dough into a ball.
4. Place dough in a large, lightly-oiled bowl and turn to coat. Cover the bowl with a damp towel; let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume or until a hole remains when dough is pressed, about 2 hours.
5. Punch down dough and turn onto a lightly floured surface. Shape into a ball and let dough rest for 15 minutes.
6. Make filling: Beat brown sugar, butter, and egg together in a bowl until creamy. Add milk, vanilla extract, and lemon extract; stir until smooth. Stir in walnuts until incorporated.
7. Roll dough on a large, floured cloth into a 20x30-inch rectangle. Spread walnut filling evenly over top of dough, spreading to the edges. Roll up along the long edge like a jelly roll and pinch edges to seal. Coil roll into a snail shape.
8. Grease a 9x13x2-inch baking sheet. Place shaped dough on the prepared sheet and let rise until an impression remains when dough is gently pressed, about 1 hour.
9. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
10. Bake in the preheated oven until top is golden brown, 40 to 45 minutes.
