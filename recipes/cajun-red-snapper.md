## Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon paprika
- ¼ teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ teaspoon onion powder
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- ¼ teaspoon dried oregano
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 6 (6 ounce) fillets red snapper
- salt to taste

## Instructions

1. Mix paprika, black pepper, thyme, basil, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, and cayenne pepper on a large piece of wax paper.
2. In a small saucepan over medium heat, melt butter with oil. Brush both sides of snapper fillets with butter-oil mixture; reserve remaining butter-oil mixture. Coat both sides of fillets with paprika mixture.
3. Heat a large cast iron skillet over high heat until a drop of water sizzles on it.
4. Drizzle 1/2 of the remaining butter-oil mixture on one side of fish fillets. Place fillets butter-side down in the hot skillet; cook until deeply browned, about 5 minutes. Drizzle remaining butter-oil mixture over fillets and flip over. Cook until fish is browned and flakes easily with a fork, about 5 minutes more. Season with salt.
