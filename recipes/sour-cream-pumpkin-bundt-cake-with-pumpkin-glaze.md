## Ingredients

- 1 cup packed brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon ground allspice
- 4 teaspoons butter
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
- 2 teaspoons baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 cups white sugar
- 1 cup butter, softened
- 4 large eggs
- 1 cup pumpkin puree
- 1 (8 ounce) container sour cream
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 ½ cups confectioners' sugar
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ⅛ teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons pumpkin puree
- 2 tablespoons milk, or as needed
- 1 teaspoon butter, melted
- ¼ teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 12-cup fluted tube pan (such as Bundt®).
2. Combine brown sugar, cinnamon, and allspice in a bowl. Cut in butter until streusel is crumbly.
3. Combine flour, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl.
4. Cream together sugar and butter using an electric mixer in a separate large bowl. Slowly add eggs while continuing to beat. Add pumpkin, sour cream, and vanilla extract and mix well. Gradually add flour mixture and beat into batter.
5. Spoon 1/2 of the batter into the prepared pan. Sprinkle streusel over batter, avoiding sides of the pan. Top with remaining batter.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean, 55 to 60 minutes. Let cake cool for 30 minutes in the pan; invert onto a wire rack to finish cooling.
7. While cake continues to cool, combine confectioners' sugar, cinnamon, and salt in a medium bowl. Combine pumpkin, milk, melted butter, and vanilla extract in a separate bowl. Add pumpkin mixture to sugar mixture using a wire whisk. Add more milk until glaze reaches desired consistency, being careful to not make it too thin, as a thick glaze will drizzle nicely also.
8. Drizzle glaze over cooled cake.
