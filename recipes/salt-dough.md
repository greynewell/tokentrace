## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 cup salt
- 1 cup cold water

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Line a baking sheet.
2. Combine flour and salt in a bowl. Add water, a few tablespoons at a time, mixing well after each addition. Knead dough for 10 minutes. Wrap and let rest for 20 minutes.
3. Transfer dough to a floured work surface and knead until soft and pliable. Roll out to a thickness of 1/8 inch; cut desired festive shapes with cookie cutters. Transfer onto the prepared baking sheet; use a toothpick to make a hole in each ornament for hanging.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until dry and hard, about 2 hours. Allow to cool completely before decorating.
