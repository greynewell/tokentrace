## Ingredients

- 2 cups grated carrots
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can bean sprouts, drained
- ½ cup chopped water chestnuts
- ¼ cup chopped green bell pepper
- ¼ cup chopped green onions
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 2 cups finely diced cooked chicken
- 4 teaspoons cornstarch
- 1 tablespoon water

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.
2. Coat a large skillet with nonstick cooking spray and heat over medium heat; cook and stir carrots, bean sprouts, water chestnuts, green pepper, green onions, and garlic until vegetables are crisp, about 3 minutes. Stir in chicken until heated through, 3 to 5 minutes.
