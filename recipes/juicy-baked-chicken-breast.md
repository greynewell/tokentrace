## Ingredients

- 2 (5 ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 2 teaspoons sazonador total (from Goya)
- ½ teaspoon granulated garlic
- salt and freshly ground pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil.
2. Drizzle olive oil over chicken breasts coating all sides. Combine sazonador total, garlic, salt, and pepper in a small bowl and sprinkle on all sides of the chicken breasts. Place chicken breasts onto the baking sheet.
3. Bake, uncovered, in the preheated oven until chicken breast is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Do not overbake. Allow to rest for 10 minutes before serving.
