## Ingredients

- 1 (15.25 ounce) package white cake mix (such as Pillsbury®)
- 3 ounces white cake mix extender
- 1 ¼ cups water
- 4  egg whites
- ⅓ cup vegetable oil
- 1 (10 ounce) jar strawberry preserves
- 1 ½ cups sliced fresh strawberries, pureed
- 1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and lightly flour a 9x13-inch baking pan.
2. Blend cake mix plus extender, water, egg whites, and oil together in a bowl using an electric mixer until just moistened. Pour batter into the prepared pan.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 32 to 26 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, combine strawberry preserves and pureed strawberries in a medium bowl. Stir in confectioners' sugar and lemon juice. Refrigerate until ready to use.
5. Transfer cake to a cooling rack and let cool to room temperature, at least 25 minutes.
