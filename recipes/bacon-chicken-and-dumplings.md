## Ingredients

- 3 slices bacon
- 3 large potatoes, peeled and diced
- 1  onion, diced
- 4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - diced
- 3 cups chicken broth
- 1 teaspoon poultry seasoning
- salt and pepper to taste
- 1 (15.25 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained and rinsed
- 3 cups half-and-half
- 1 ½ cups biscuit mix
- 1 cup milk

## Instructions

1. Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside; reserve bacon drippings in skillet.
2. Add potatoes, onion and chicken to bacon drippings and cook for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Pour in chicken broth; season with poultry seasoning, salt and pepper. Stir in corn, and simmer all together for 15 minutes.
