1. Wrap thawed tofu in a paper or tea towel and press using a heavy object, 30 to 60 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, combine flour, nutritional yeast, seasoned salt, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl.

4. Add mustard and mix well.
5. Fill a pot or deep fryer 3 to 4 inches full with oil and set over medium-low heat.
