## Ingredients

- 1 (13.8 ounce) package refrigerated pizza dough (such as Pillsbury®)
- 9 teaspoons pizza sauce
- 1 (1.75 ounce) package pepperoni (such as Hormel®)
- 4 ½ tablespoons shredded mozzarella cheese
- avocado oil cooking spray

## Instructions

1. Roll out pizza dough on a lightly floured surface. Cut out 9 circles using a 2 1/8-inch biscuit cutter. Roll each circle into a 4 1/2-inch disc. Fill each disc with 1 teaspoon pizza sauce, 3 slices pepperoni, and 1/2 tablespoon mozzarella cheese. Fold over, secure edges by folding, and crimp with the tines of a fork.
2. Preheat an air fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line the air fryer basket with parchment paper and spray with avocado oil. Place a batch of calzones into the basket and mist them with avocado oil.
3. Air fry for 6 to 8 minutes. Turn calzones over, mist with avocado oil, and air fry until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes more. Repeat with remaining calzones.
