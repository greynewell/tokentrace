## Ingredients

- 4  water, or as needed
- 2 cups white sugar
- 1 ½ cups salt
- 1 (8 pound) bone-in pork shoulder (Boston butt), or more to taste
- 4 tablespoons brown sugar, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Combine 4 cups water, sugar, and salt in a 7- to 9-quart Dutch oven. Add pork shoulder, skin-side up. The meat should be just about covered by water but if not, add a little more. Cover and put in the refrigerator for 24 hours.
2. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Remove the Dutch oven from the refrigerator and drain and discard brine.
3. Cover and cook in the preheated oven, drizzling juices from the bottom of the pot over the roast with a baster to keep it moist every 45 minutes, 5 to 7 hours. Coat top of roast with brown sugar, use juices to wet brown sugar, and continue to cook until meat is tender and soft, about 1 hour longer.
4. Transfer roast to a cutting board, remove shoulder bone, and shred meat. Return shredded meat to the Dutch oven and mix with juices. Serve.
