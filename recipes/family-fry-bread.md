## Ingredients

- 3 ¼ cups all-purpose flour, divided
- 1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
- 1 ½ teaspoons white sugar
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt
- 1 ½ cups warm water, or as needed
- 2 tablespoons melted butter
- 2 cups oil for frying, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Whisk 3 cups flour, yeast, sugar, and salt together in a bowl.
2. Whisk water and butter together in a separate bowl; pour into flour mixture and stir until mixture comes together to form a ball and is slightly sticky and elastic. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Cover bowl with a towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
3. Punch down dough and turn onto a lightly floured surface. Knead in 1/4 cup flour, if necessary. Shape into 10 balls.
4. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large cast iron skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
5. Roll each dough ball out on a lightly floured surface into an 8-inch round.
6. Place each round into the hot oil and fry until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Remove fry bread to a baking sheet lined with paper towels. Repeat with remaining dough rounds.
