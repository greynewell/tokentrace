## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups whole wheat flour
- ½ cup white sugar
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon  (Optional)
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup skim milk
- 1  egg
- 2 tablespoons butter, softened
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 2 cups fresh blueberries
- ½ cup brown sugar  (Optional)
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 6 jumbo muffin cups with paper liners.
2. Whisk whole wheat flour, white sugar, baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk skim milk, egg, softened butter, and vegetable oil.

3. Combine brown sugar with 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon in a bowl and spoon the mixture onto the muffins, if desired.
