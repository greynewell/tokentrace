## Ingredients

- 1 pound sashimi grade yellowfin tuna
- kosher salt to taste
- fresh ground black pepper to taste
- ½ cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs
- 3 tablespoons olive oil

## Instructions

1. With a sharp knife, cut tuna into 4 pieces for an appetizer portion, or 2 large pieces for a dinner portion. Use your judgment on what shape you want to cut your tuna because not all tuna is the same size or shape. However, the shape should somewhat resemble a miniature brick.
2. Season tuna pieces with salt and pepper. Coat lightly on all sides with bread crumbs. Heat olive oil in a large heavy skillet over high heat. The pan should be as hot as you can get it. Place tuna in the pan and sear on each side for about 45 seconds for small portions, or 1 minute for large. Remove from the pan. Tuna will be very rare.
3. Slice each piece into 1/4-inch thick slices, and fan out on a serving plate. Enjoy plain, or with condiments of your choice.
