## Ingredients

- 1 large head broccoli
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 2 tablespoons teriyaki sauce
- 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
- Cracked black pepper, to taste
- Garlic powder, to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400°F. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil for easy cleanup.
2. Spread butter evenly across the foil-lined pan. If the butter is cold, place the pan in the warming oven for a minute to soften it, then spread with a brush or paper towel.
3. Cut the broccoli into small florets so each piece lays flat against the foil. Discard the thick woody stem or save it for stock.
4. Arrange the florets in a single layer on the buttered pan. Drizzle the teriyaki sauce and Worcestershire sauce evenly over the broccoli in equal amounts.
5. Season with cracked black pepper and a light dusting of garlic powder.
6. Roast for 35 minutes, checking every 10 to 15 minutes. The broccoli is done when the edges are lightly charred and crisp, and the stems are tender when pierced with a fork.

## Notes

Pairs perfectly with Teriyaki and Sesame Seed Chicken and steamed rice for a complete meal. Keep the florets roughly the same size so they cook evenly. If your broccoli starts darkening too quickly, move the pan to a lower oven rack.
