## Ingredients

- 3 teaspoons butter, softened
- 4 slices cinnamon-raisin bread
- ½  Granny Smith apple - peeled, cored, and thinly sliced
- ⅔ cup shredded Gruyere cheese
- 6 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves removed

## Instructions

1. Spread butter on 1 side of each slice of bread; flip, so that buttered sides are facing down. Top 2 slices of bread with apple slices, 1/3 cup Gruyere cheese, and a sprinkle of thyme leaves. Place the other 2 slices of bread on top, buttered sides facing up.
2. Heat a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add sandwiches to the hot pan and cook until bread has toasted and cheese has slightly melted, 4 to 5 minutes. Flip carefully using a spatula, pressing down lightly. Cook sandwiches until golden brown and cheese has melted, 3 to 4 minutes more, watching and adjusting heat if necessary to keep bread from burning before cheese has melted.
3. Transfer sandwiches to a plate, slice in 1/2 diagonally, and serve immediately.
