## Ingredients

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 cup whole wheat flour
- 1 tablespoon chia seeds
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ¼ teaspoon ground ginger
- ½ cup unsalted butter, room temperature
- ½ cup brown sugar, or to taste

- ¾ cup cranberries, or more to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line 12 muffin cups with paper liners.
2. Mix all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, chia seeds, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger together in a large bowl.
3. Beat butter, brown sugar, and white sugar together with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Beat egg into the butter mixture. Mash banana into the butter mixture until smoothly incorporated. Fold carrot and orange zest into the mixture.
