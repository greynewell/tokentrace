## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 2 pounds beef chuck roast, cut into 1/2-inch thick strips
- salt and pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon butter
- ½ medium onion, sliced or diced
- 8 ounces sliced mushrooms
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 ½ tablespoons all-purpose flour
- ½ cup white wine
- 2 cups beef broth, divided
- ¾ cup creme fraiche
- 1 tablespoon fresh chopped chives
- salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Season beef generously with salt and pepper.
2. Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat until nearly smoking. Stir in beef; cook, stirring constantly, for 6 to 7 minutes, until liquid evaporates and meat browns. Remove meat from the pan and set aside.
3. Stir mushrooms, onions, and butter into the pan; cook and stir over medium heat until vegetables are lightly browned. Add garlic and stir for 30 seconds. Stir in flour; cook for 1 to 2 minutes until incorporated.
4. Stir in wine and 1 cup of broth, scraping the bottom of the pan to release any browned bits. Bring to a simmer and cook until the sauce thickens, about 3 to 4 minutes.
5. Return beef to the pan. Stir in remaining cup of broth; bring to a simmer and cook on low heat for about 1 hour, covered, until beef is tender and sauce is thick. Stir every 20 minutes.
6. Stir in crème fraîche. Stir in chives. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
