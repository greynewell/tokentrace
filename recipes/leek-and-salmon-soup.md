## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 3  leeks, white and light green parts only, thinly sliced
- 2 small yellow onions, thinly sliced
- 2  shallots, thinly sliced
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 5 cups vegetable stock, divided
- 2 large yellow potatoes, sliced
- 1 small head cauliflower, broken into small florets
- 2  carrots, sliced
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1 pound skinless salmon fillet, cut into large chunks
- salt and cracked black pepper to taste
- ½ (2.8 ounce) package French-fried onions, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add leeks, onions, and shallots. Add garlic and salt. Cook and stir until all is well wilted and soft, but not browned, about 3 minutes.
2. Pour 4 cups of stock into the pot; add potatoes, cauliflower, and carrots. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and cook until carrots and potatoes are soft, about 20 minutes. Insert a hand blender into the soup and blend until creamy-smooth. Add more broth if too thick; the soup should be the consistency of thick bisque.
3. Stir cream into the soup; cook until heated through but not boiling. Add salmon; cook and stir until it flakes apart, 5 to 6 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Pour into bowls and sprinkle onions on top.
