## Ingredients

- 1 (2 pound) fryer chicken
- 3 cups water
- 2 (14.5 ounce) cans chicken broth
- 1 tablespoon salted butter
- 3 large leeks, sliced
- 1 quart heavy cream
- 2 large potatoes, peeled and diced
- 1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Place chicken, water, and chicken broth in a large, heavy stockpot over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat, cover, and simmer until liquid has reduced by about half, chicken is no longer pink at the bone, and the juices run clear, about 1 1/2 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
2. Remove chicken and allow to cool. Strain stock and set aside.
3. Add butter to the stockpot and melt over medium heat. Add leeks and saute until browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour in cream, potatoes, and reserved stock; cook at a simmer for 15 minutes.
4. Meanwhile debone the chicken and dice the meat.
5. Add diced chicken to the soup and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes more.
