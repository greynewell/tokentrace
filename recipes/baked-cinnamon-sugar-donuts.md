## Ingredients

- nonstick cooking spray
- ½ cup white sugar
- ⅓ cup butter, softened
- ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1  egg
- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 2 ½ teaspoons baking powder
- ½ cup milk
- ½ cup butter, melted
- ⅔ cup white sugar
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray 9 cavities of a 12-cavity doughnut pan with cooking spray.
2. Combine sugar, butter, nutmeg, and salt in a medium bowl; beat with an electric mixer until well combined. Add egg and mix until incorporated.
3. Combine flour and baking powder in a small bowl. Add flour mixture to butter mixture in batches, alternating with milk, beating batter briefly after each addition. Pour batter into a large resealable plastic bag. Snip off one corner of the bag and pipe batter into the 9 prepared cavities of the doughnut pan, filling each halfway.
4. Bake doughnuts in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, 7 to 9 minutes.
5. While the doughnuts are baking, place melted butter for topping in a shallow bowl. Mix together 2/3 cup sugar and cinnamon in another shallow bowl. Roll warm doughnuts in melted butter and then in cinnamon sugar to coat.
