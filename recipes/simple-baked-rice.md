## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 1 cup long-grain rice
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- ¼ cup diced carrot
- ¼ cup diced celery
- ¼ cup diced onion
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 cups chicken stock
- 1  bay leaf
- 1 pinch ground black pepper, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare a 2-quart casserole dish with cooking spray.
2. Spread long-grain rice into prepared casserole dish.
3. Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir carrot, celery, and onion in hot oil until onion is soft and translucent, about 4 minutes. Stir garlic into mixture; cook and stir 1 minute more. Increase heat to high; add chicken stock and bay leaf to the saucepan and bring to a boil. Pour the mixture over the rice in the casserole dish. Cover the dish tightly with aluminum foil.
