## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups milk
- ½ cup sugar
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt
- 2 teaspoons lemon zest
- ¾ cup butter
- 1 (.25 ounce) envelope active dry yeast
- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- ¼ cup warm water
- 2  eggs
- 2  egg yolks
- 5 ⅔ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 cup raisins
- ½ cup chopped nuts
- 1  egg, beaten

## Instructions

1. In a small saucepan, heat milk until hot, but not boiling; mix in 1/2 cup sugar, salt, lemon zest, and butter. Remove from heat, and cool slightly. In a small bowl, mix together yeast, 1 teaspoon sugar, and 1/4 cup water; stir into milk. Beat in 2 eggs and egg yolks. Mix in 3 cups flour. Cover, and let rise in a warm place.
2. Mix in the raisins and nuts. Gradually mix in enough of the remaining flour to form a soft dough. Place dough in a well-oiled bowl, cover, and set aside to rise.
3. Divide dough into 3 balls. Roll each ball out into a thick log, braid, and tuck the ends under. Place on a large cookie sheet, and set aside to rise one more time.
4. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Brush beaten egg over the dough. It gives a shine to it.
5. Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes.
