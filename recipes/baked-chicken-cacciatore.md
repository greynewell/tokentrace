## Ingredients

- nonstick cooking spray
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon salt, divided
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon garlic powder
- 6 (4 ounce) skinless, bone-in chicken thighs
- 2 tablespoons olive oil, or more as needed
- 2 small onions, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste
- 1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
- ½ cup red wine, or more as needed
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can stewed tomatoes with juice
- 1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
- aluminum foil

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
2. Mix together flour, 1/4 teaspoon salt, pepper, and garlic powder in a shallow bowl. Dredge chicken in the flour mixture, shaking off any excess.
3. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until nicely browned, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to the prepared baking dish.
4. Add onions and garlic to the skillet and saute until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add mushrooms and more oil, if necessary, and cook until mushrooms have softened, about 5 minutes. Pour 1/2 cup wine into the pan, scrape the browned bits of food off the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon, and cook until liquid has evaporated, about 5 minutes. Stir in stewed tomatoes with juice, tomato sauce, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt. Simmer for 1 to 2 minutes, adding extra wine if sauce seems too thick. Pour mixture over chicken in the baking dish and cover with aluminum foil.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
