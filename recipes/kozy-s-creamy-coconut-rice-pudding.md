## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups water
- ¾ cup white rice
- 1 (13.5 ounce) can coconut milk
- ¼ cup white sugar
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ½ cup milk
- 1  egg, beaten
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin coconut oil
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
