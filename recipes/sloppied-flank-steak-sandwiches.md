## Ingredients

- 1 ½ pounds beef flank steak
- 1 tablespoon steak seasoning (such as Montreal Steak Seasoning®)
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- ¼ cup brown sugar
- 1 small onion, chopped
- 1 small red bell pepper, chopped
- 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- 2 cups tomato sauce
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 6  hamburger buns, split and toasted

## Instructions

1. Sprinkle the beef flank steak with steak seasoning on both sides. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat until the oil shimmers, and place the flank steak into the hot oil. Quickly brown the steak on both sides, about 5 minutes per side. Set the beef aside.
2. Stir brown sugar, onion, red bell pepper, apple cider vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, tomato sauce, and tomato paste together in a slow cooker until the brown sugar dissolves. Place the flank steak into the slow cooker, immersing it in the sauce. Set the cooker on on High and cook 4 hours, or set on Low and cook 8 hours.
3. To serve, shred the meat with 2 forks, or remove the meat, chop, and return to the sauce. Toast buns, and serve the sloppied steak on the toasted buns.
