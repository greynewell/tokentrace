## Ingredients

- 2  eggs
- 2 tablespoons ranch dressing
- 2 cups seasoned bread crumbs
- 1 tablespoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- salt and pepper to taste
- 6  skinless, boneless chicken thighs

## Instructions

1. Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet with cooking spray.
2. Beat the eggs and ranch dressing together in a bowl; set aside. Stir together the bread crumbs, garlic powder, paprika, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until evenly combined. Dip the chicken thighs into the egg mixture, then press into the breadcrumbs to coat all sides; place the chicken onto the prepared baking sheet.
3. Cook the chicken thighs until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 50 to 60 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
