## Ingredients

- 8  (3/4-inch thick) salmon steaks
- 1 cup chicken broth
- 1 small onion, thickly sliced
- 4 sprigs fresh parsley
- 4 slices  lemon
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 4 teaspoons finely chopped fresh dill
- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 2 large egg yolks, lightly beaten
- 2 teaspoons lemon juice

## Instructions

1. Rinse salmon and pat dry.
2. Combine chicken broth, onion, parsley, lemon, salt, and pepper in a large skillet. Bring to a boil. Add salmon to the skillet in a single layer. Bring back to a boil.
