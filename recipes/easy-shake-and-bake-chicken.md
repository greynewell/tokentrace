## Ingredients

- 3 pounds chicken, cut into pieces
- ½ cup all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- ¼ teaspoon sage
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ cup butter

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
2. Mix flour, salt, paprika, sage, and pepper together in a resealable plastic bag. Place chicken parts into the bag; seal and shake until well coated.
3. Melt butter in a 9x13-inch baking dish in the preheated oven. Arrange coated chicken pieces in the baking dish skin-side down and bake for 20 minutes. Turn chicken pieces over and bake until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
