## Ingredients

- 4 ounces Brie cheese
- 4 slices rye bread
- 1 (28 ounce) can tomato puree
- ½ teaspoon red pepper flakes
- ⅛ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- ¾ teaspoon dried basil
- ½ teaspoon white sugar
- ¼ cup milk
- 4 ounces cream cheese, cubed
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil leaves  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven or a toaster oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spread the Brie cheese onto two slices of bread, and top with remaining slices. Place on a baking sheet and toast in the oven for about 8 minutes, turning once halfway through. Cut in half, and set aside.
