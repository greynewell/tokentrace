## Ingredients

- ¾ cup milk
- 1 teaspoon white vinegar
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon grated nutmeg
- ½ cup butter, chilled and cut into small pieces
- 1 cup dried cranberries
- ½ cup chopped pecans
- 1  egg white, beaten
- 1 ½ cups confectioners' sugar
- 2 tablespoons milk

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Combine 3/4 cup milk and vinegar in a bowl; let stand until milk is curdled, about 5 minutes.
