## Ingredients

- 3 large sweet potatoes
- 2  avocados, peeled and pitted
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ⅓ cup diced red onion
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
2. Make a long, narrow cut lengthwise down the center of each sweet potato. Wrap each potato in aluminum foil.
3. Bake potatoes directly on the rack of the preheated oven until tender, about 1 hour.
