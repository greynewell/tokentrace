## Ingredients

- 1 whole chicken, into halves
- ¼ cup rice vinegar
- 2 tablespoons barbeque sauce
- 2 cloves garlic, crushed
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- ½ cup barbeque sauce, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Cut 1/2-inch deep slashes in the skin-side of each chicken half; 2 cuts in each breast, 2 in the thigh, and 1 on the leg; remove wing tips.
2. Whisk rice vinegar, barbeque sauce, and garlic together in large bowl. Place chicken in bowl and turn to coat chicken in the marinade. Arrange chicken halves, cut-side down, in the bottom of the marinade bowl, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 1 hour.
3. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
4. Remove chicken from bowl, pat chicken dry with paper towels, and discard marinade. Place chicken halves, skin-side up, on a plate and season with salt, pepper, paprika, onion powder, and cayenne pepper.
5. Cook chicken, skin-side down, on the preheated grill for 3 to 4 minutes. Turn chicken over, close the lid of the grill, and cook, basting with remaining barbeque sauce ever 6 minutes, until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 35 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
