## Ingredients

- 2 large eggs
- ¼ teaspoon white vinegar
- 1 pinch salt
- 1 teaspoon unsalted butter, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone liner (such as Silpat®) and butter lightly.
2. Crack 1 egg into a clean hand and then separate carefully by letting the egg white drip down between your fingers into a large bowl. Reserve the yolk in a separate, smaller bowl. Repeat with second egg.
3. Pour vinegar into the egg whites, add salt, and whip with a whisk until we have relatively firm, but not dry, peaks.
4. Spoon onto the prepared baking sheet, making sure they are not too wide, as we want some height here. Shape as desired and make a small depression in the top centers using a spoon for yolks.
5. Bake in center of the preheated oven until they just start to take on some golden color, 5 to 6 minutes. Add yolks and bake until yolks are heated through, but still runny, 3 to 4 minutes more. Serve on butter toast.
