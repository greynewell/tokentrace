- 2 teaspoons cream cheese flavoring
- 2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour

## Instructions

1. Cream butter and sugar together in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Add eggs, vanilla extract, and cream cheese flavoring and mix until just combined. Stir in flour, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon until dough comes together. Cover dough with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 hours or overnight.
2. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking sheets
3. Place chilled dough on the prepared baking sheet and roll it out to 1/4-inch thickness. Place a stencil on top and cut around the edges using a sharp knife. Remove excess dough. Re-roll scraps and repeat rolling and cutting to create the second letter or number on the second prepared baking sheet.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until slightly golden, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool completely on a wire rack, about 1 hour.
5. Beat cream cheese, confectioners' sugar, and cream in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment on medium speed until mixture starts to thicken. Add cream cheese flavoring and vanilla extract and beat until stiff peaks form. Fit a piping bag with a large round tip or a star tip and fill the bag with frosting.
6. Place the first cookie on a serving tray or large clean board. Pipe rows of frosting to cover the cookie. Gently place the second cookie on top of the frosting and repeat the pattern for frosting. Decorate cookie tart as desired with raspberries, strawberries, pretzels. and faux flowers.
