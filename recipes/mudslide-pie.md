## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 1 (20 ounce) package dark chocolate sandwich cookies (such as Oreo(R))
- 5 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
- ¼ teaspoon kosher salt
- ½ cup hot fudge dessert topping, divided
- 1 pint coffee ice cream, softened
- ¾ cup heavy cream
- 1 ½ tablespoons coffee liqueur (such as Kahlua®)
- 1 tablespoon Irish cream liqueur (such as Baileys®)
- ¼ teaspoon vanilla extract
- ½ (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
- 1 cup chocolate-covered espresso beans, coarsely chopped

## Instructions

1. Lightly grease a 9 1/2-inch deep dish pie plate with cooking spray; set aside.
2. Combine dark chocolate sandwich cookies, butter, and salt in the bowl of a food processor and pulse until finely chopped and mixture sticks together when pinched with your fingers, about 20 times. Transfer cookie mixture to the prepared pie dish and press evenly onto the bottom and up the sides of dish to form a crust. Place in a refrigerator until ready to use.
3. Microwave fudge topping, 30 seconds to 1 minute, until runny. Set aside and let cool slightly, about 5 minutes.
4. Remove crust from the refrigerator and spread softened coffee ice cream evenly over the bottom. Drizzle 1/4 cup fudge topping over ice cream. Place in a freezer until firm, about 45 minutes.
5. Combine cream, coffee liqueur, Irish cream liqueur, and vanilla extract in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Beat until stiff peaks almost form, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Fold sweetened condensed milk into whipped cream mixture until combined and mixture is light and fluffy. Fold in 1/2 cup chopped espresso beans.
6. Remove pie from the freezer and top with the whipped cream mixture. Freeze until cream mixture has hardened, about 2 hours.
7. Repeat process of microwaving remaining 1/4 cup fudge topping and cooling slightly. Remove pie from the freezer and drizzle fudge topping over the cream layer. Top with the remaining espresso beans. Return to the freezer until completely frozen, 8 hours or overnight.
8. Remove from the freezer 10 minutes before serving. Slice and serve immediately.
