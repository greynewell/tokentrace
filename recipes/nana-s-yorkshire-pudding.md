## Ingredients

- 1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- 3  large eggs
- ¾ cup milk
- ¼ cup water
- 2 tablespoons butter, divided

## Instructions

1. Mix flour, salt, and baking soda together in a large bowl; make a deep well in the center of flour mixture.
2. Break eggs into the well and beat until smooth.
3. Mix milk and water together in a small bowl; slowly stir milk mixture, about 1/4 cup at a time, into flour mixture until batter is a thin, paste-like consistency.
4. Cover bowl and allow batter to stand at room temperature for 1 hour.
5. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
6. Grease a 12-cup muffin tin with butter, using 1/2 teaspoon butter per muffin cup.
7. Place muffin tin on the second shelf from the top in the preheated oven until butter melts and begins to smoke, 3 to 4 minutes.
8. Whisk the batter to fully incorporate all the ingredients, about 2 minutes.
9. Pour batter into the melted butter in each muffin tin, 1/2 to 2/3 full.
10. Bake in the preheated oven until puddings are golden brown and well-risen, keeping the oven door closed the entire time of cooking, 17 to 20 minutes.
