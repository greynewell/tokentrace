## Ingredients

- 24  frog's legs, skin removed
- 1 (4 ounce) packet saltine crackers, crushed
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- ½ cup cornmeal
- 1 teaspoon minced onion
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1 tablespoon ground black pepper
- 2  eggs
- ½ cup milk
- 2 cups vegetable oil for frying
- 1 cup peanut oil for frying

## Instructions

1. Rinse frog legs and pat dry; set aside. Combine flour, cornmeal, saltine cracker crumbs, pepper, salt, and onion in a large resealable bag; shake well to mix. Whisk eggs and milk together in a shallow bowl.
2. Heat vegetable oil and peanut oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. The oil should be about 1/2 inch deep.
3. Dip legs into egg mixture in batches, then press into cracker mixture until evenly coated. Place the breaded legs, unstacked, onto a plate. Repeat with remaining legs.
4. Lower breaded legs carefully into the hot oil in batches. Fry until golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes on each side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Repeat with remaining frog legs.
