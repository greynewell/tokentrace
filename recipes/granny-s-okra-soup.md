## Ingredients

- 4 cups chopped tomatoes
- 2 cups lima beans
- 2 cups chopped okra
- 2 cups chopped red potatoes
- 1 cup corn
- 1 cup green beans
- ½ cup chopped carrots
- 1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
- 4 cups chicken stock
- 1 pound ground beef
- ½ tablespoon garlic powder
- ½ tablespoon celery salt
- ½ tablespoon onion powder
- 1 small onion, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, crushed, or more to taste
- 3 tablespoons butter

## Instructions

1. Combine tomatoes, lima beans, okra, potatoes, corn, green beans, carrots, and tomato paste in a large soup pot. Pour chicken stock over mixture and bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat and simmer until vegetables begin to soften, about 15 minutes.
2. Season ground beef with garlic powder, celery salt, and onion powder. Set aside.
3. Heat butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic when butter stops bubbling; cook and stir for 1 minute. Spread ground beef evenly in the pan. Cook until it has a nice brown sear, stirring minimally to end up with mostly medium-sized chunks, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain skillet and add beef, onions, and garlic to the soup pot.
4. Bring soup mixture to a boil; reduce heat to simmer, cover, and cook until vegetables and beef have cooked down, 1 to 2 hours.
