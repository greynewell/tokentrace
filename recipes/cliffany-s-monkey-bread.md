## Ingredients

- 1 cup white sugar
- 2 tablespoons ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon nutmeg
- 4 (7.5 ounce) packages refrigerated biscuit dough, separated and cut into quarters
- ¾ cup margarine
- ¾ cup brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Combine sugar, 2 tablespoons cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a bag. Drop biscuit quarters into bag and shake well to coat biscuits.
