## Ingredients

- 5 tablespoons white sugar
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 5 medium apples - peeled, cored, and thinly sliced
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 cups white sugar
- 1 cup vegetable oil
- ½ cup orange juice
- 4 large eggs
- 3 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10-inch tube pan.
2. Mix 5 tablespoons sugar and cinnamon together in a large bowl. Add apple slices and toss to coat.
3. Mix flour, 2 cups sugar, oil, orange juice, eggs, baking powder, salt, and vanilla extract together in another bowl and beat until smooth and thoroughly blended. Batter will be thick.
4. Place 1/2 of the batter in the prepared tube pan. Top with 1/2 of the apple slices. Add remaining batter to the pan, and neatly arrange remaining apple slices on top.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Let cool in the pan for 1 hour. Run a table knife around the edges to loosen. Invert carefully onto a cooling rack to cool completely.
