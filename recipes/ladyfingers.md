## Ingredients

- 4  eggs, separated
- ⅔ cup white sugar
- ⅞ cup all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon baking powder

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). Line two 17x12-inch baking sheets with parchment paper. Fit a large pastry bag with a plain 1/2- inch round tube.
2. Place egg whites in a large bowl and beat on high with an electric mixer until soft peaks start to form. Add 2 tablespoons sugar and continue beating until stiff and glossy.
3. Beat egg yolks and remaining sugar in a separate bowl until thick and very pale in color.
4. Fold 1/2 of the egg whites into egg yolk mixture; sift in flour and baking powder, then fold in the remaining egg whites until combined.
5. Transfer the mixture to the prepared pastry bag. Pipe 3-inch "fingers" in rows about 1 inch apart on the prepared baking sheets.
6. Bake in preheated oven until firm to the touch and just golden, about 8 minutes.
