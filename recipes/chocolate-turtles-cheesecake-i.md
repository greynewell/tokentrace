## Ingredients

- 2 cups vanilla wafer crumbs
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
- 1 (14 ounce) package individually wrapped caramels
- 1 (5 ounce) can evaporated milk
- 1 cup chopped pecans
- 2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
- ½ cup white sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2  eggs
- ½ cup semisweet chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large bowl, mix together the cookie crumbs and melted butter. Press into the bottom of a 9 inch springform pan.
2. In a heavy saucepan over low heat, melt the caramels with the evaporated milk. Heat and stir frequently until smooth. Pour caramel sauce into crust, and top with pecans.
3. In a large bowl, combine cream cheese, sugar and vanilla; beat well until smooth. Add eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Melt the chocolate, and blend into cream cheese mixture. Pour chocolate batter over pecans.
