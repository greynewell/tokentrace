## Ingredients

- 3 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
- 4 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 ⅓ cups white sugar
- 1 ¼ cups milk
- 1 cup sour cream
- ½ cup melted butter
- 2 large eggs

2. Sift flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl.
3. Combine sugar, milk, sour cream, butter, eggs, and lemon zest in a large bowl. Beat with an electric mixer on low speed until blended. Fold in the flour mixture until batter is just moistened. Fold in blueberries; avoid overmixing because batter will turn purple.
