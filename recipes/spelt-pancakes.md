## Ingredients

- ¾ cup milk
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 1  egg, beaten
- 1 tablespoon melted butter
- 1 cup spelt flour
- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ¾ teaspoon baking soda
- ¼ teaspoon salt

## Instructions

1. Combine milk and lemon juice in a bowl and set aside to sour, about 5 minutes. Add beaten egg and melted butter; stir to combine.
2. Combine spelt flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Stir gently into milk mixture until just combined; batter will be lumpy.
3. Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 1 to 2 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
