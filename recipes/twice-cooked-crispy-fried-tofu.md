## Ingredients

- 1 (16 ounce) package extra firm tofu, drained
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 3 tablespoons cornstarch
- ¼ teaspoon paprika
- ground thyme
- ¼ teaspoon seasoned salt (such as LAWRY'S®)
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly oil a baking sheet.
2. Pat tofu dry with a paper towel. Slice in half lengthwise. Cut each half into 1/4-inch pieces, about 14 pieces in total. Place tofu between paper towels and drain, about 20 minutes.
3. Season tofu with salt and pepper. Let sit for 10 minutes.
4. Mix cornstarch, paprika, thyme, and seasoned salt together to make cornstarch seasoning.
5. Pat any excess moisture off the tofu. Sprinkle cornstarch seasoning evenly over top. Arrange on a baking sheet.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until tofu starts to brown, about 7 minutes. Turn over and continue baking until the upper side is darkened, about 3 minutes more.
7. Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add tofu and fry until golden-brown, about 2 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels.
