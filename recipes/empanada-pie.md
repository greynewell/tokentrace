## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 1 medium onion, quartered
- 3 cloves garlic
- 2 tablespoons canola oil
- 1 (8 ounce) package mushrooms, chopped
- ½ cup pitted Kalamata olives
- 1 tablespoon dried oregano
- 2 ½ teaspoons paprika
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- ½ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
- ⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste
- 1 pound 90% lean ground beef
- 1 (15 ounce) package pie crusts
- 1 small egg
- 1 teaspoon water

## Instructions

1. Place onion in a food processor and process to a medium chop. Use a garlic press to add garlic to the chopped onion.
2. Preheat a saute pan over medium-high heat. Add oil, onion, and garlic to the hot pan. Reduce heat to medium and saute until golden, about 5 minutes.
3. Place mushrooms in the food processor and process to a medium dice. Stir into the onion mixture and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Meanwhile, process olives to a fine mince and set aside.
4. Add oregano, paprika, cumin, red pepper flakes, and pepper to the pan; cook and stir until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Crumble in ground beef and cook, breaking up with a spoon or spatula, until thoroughly browned, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir in olives. Remove from heat and cool for 20 to 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
5. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Spray a 9-inch pie plate with cooking spray. Line the plate with 1 pie crust.
6. Carefully spoon the cooled beef mixture into the crust. Press the second crust on top. Slice air vents in the top crust.
7. Beat egg and water together in a small bowl. Brush egg wash thoroughly over the complete surface of the pie.
8. Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden brown, 45 to 50 minutes. Let cool for 5 to 10 minutes before cutting and serving.
