## Ingredients

- 2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
- 1 cup warm water (110 degrees F (43 degrees C))
- 3 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 1 tablespoon shortening, melted
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1  egg yolk
- 1 tablespoon water
- coarse salt, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Stir yeast into 1 cup warm water in a large bowl; beat in flour, sugar, shortening, and salt to make a dough. Turn dough onto a floured surface and knead for 5 minutes.

4. Shape each rope of dough into a pretzel on the prepared baking sheet; let pretzels rest for 5 minutes. Beat egg yolk with 1 tablespoon water in a small bowl and brush yolk mixture over each pretzel; sprinkle each with coarse salt.
