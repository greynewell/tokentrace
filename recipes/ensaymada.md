## Ingredients

- 1 ½ tablespoons active dry yeast
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 1 cup warm water, divided
- 8  egg yolks
- 3 cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 cup melted butter, divided
- ½ cup milk
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon melted butter, or as needed
- 1 tablespoon white sugar, or as needed
- ¼ cup grated Cheddar cheese, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Dissolve yeast and 1 tablespoon sugar in 1/2 cup water.
2. Combine remaining water, egg yolks, flour, 1 cup sugar, 2/3 cup melted butter, milk, and salt in a bowl. Stir in yeast mixture until a dough forms. Transfer to a floured surface and knead until dough is smooth, elastic, and no longer sticky, adding more flour as needed.
3. Place dough into a greased bowl and let rise until doubled in size, about 2 hours.
4. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
5. Divide dough into 1-ounce balls. Roll out each ball into a thin rectangle and brush with remaining 1/3 cup melted butter. Roll dough lengthwise and shape. Place onto a baking sheet. Cover and let rise until light and dough is soft, about 30 minutes.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and easy to pick up off of the baking sheet, about 15 minutes.
7. Remove from the oven and brush warm tops with melted butter, dust with sugar, and sprinkle with Cheddar cheese. Serve warm.
