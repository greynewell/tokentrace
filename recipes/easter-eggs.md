## Ingredients

- 2 pounds confectioners' sugar
- ¼ pound margarine, softened
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 12 ounces peanut butter
- 1 pound flaked coconut
- 4 cups semisweet chocolate chips
- 2 tablespoons shortening

## Instructions

1. Beat cream cheese, margarine, and vanilla with an electric mixer in a mixing bowl until well combined. Add confectioners' sugar in batches and beat until ingredients are evenly distributed; dough will be very stiff.
2. Divide the batter in half and place each half of the batter in a separate bowl. Stir peanut butter into one of the bowls and coconut flakes into the second.
3. Using your hands, mold the dough into egg-shapes and arrange the forms on cookie sheets. Place the eggs in the freezer until frozen, 1 to 2 hour.
4. Once the eggs have frozen, melt the chocolate and shortening in the top of a double-boiler. Dip the eggs into the chocolate until coated. Place the eggs on waxed paper-lined cookie sheets and return to the freezer to harden. After the chocolate has hardened, the eggs can be kept in the refrigerator.
