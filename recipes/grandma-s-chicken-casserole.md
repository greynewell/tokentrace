## Ingredients

- 4 large skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- water to cover
- 1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 2 (15 ounce) cans mixed vegetables (such as Veg-All®), drained
- 2 (10.5 ounce) cans cream of chicken soup

- 1 (8 ounce) can sliced water chestnuts, drained
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
