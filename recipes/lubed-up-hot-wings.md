## Ingredients

- 4 cups vegetable oil for frying
- 3  eggs
- ¼ cup milk
- 1 cup bread flour
- ½ cup brown sugar and butter flavored breakfast cereal (such as Cap'n Crunch®), finely ground
- 5 pounds large chicken wings, patted dry with paper towels
- ¾ cup unsalted butter, melted
- ¾ cup hot pepper sauce (such as Frank's RedHot®)
- ¼ cup bourbon whiskey
- 3 tablespoons honey
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tablespoon habanero pepper sauce

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Whisk together eggs and milk in a bowl. In a separate bowl, stir together the bread flour and ground cereal. Coat the wings in the egg mixture, then in the cereal mixture.
3. Fry the wings, 6 at a time, in the oil until golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Let wings drain on paper towels.
4. Preheat oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Line several baking sheets with parchment paper.
5. While wings are frying, mix the melted butter, hot sauce, bourbon, honey, Worcestershire sauce, and habanero sauce in a large plastic tub with a lid. Place the wings into the sauce, close the lid, and shake to coat wings with sauce.
6. Place the wings on the prepared baking sheets and bake in the preheated oven until the sauce is slightly sticky, about 10 minutes.
