## Ingredients

- ⅓ cup honey
- ⅓ cup soy sauce
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 3 tablespoons ketchup
- 2 tablespoons sriracha sauce
- 2 pounds chicken breast, cut into 1-inch cubes
- ¼ cup cornstarch
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- ¼ cup chicken broth
- 2  green onions, chopped
- 1 teaspoon sesame seeds, or as desired

## Instructions

1. Combine honey, soy sauce, garlic, ketchup, and sriracha sauce in a bowl; mix well and set aside.
2. Place chicken pieces in a large bowl, add cornstarch, and toss to combine.
3. Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and select the Saute function. Add oil until hot. Add 1/2 the chicken and cook for 3 minutes. Flip and cook 2 more minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate and repeat with remaining chicken. Pour chicken broth into the empty Instant Pot® and cook for 2 minutes, scraping up the brown bits with a wooden spoon to deglaze the pot. Turn Instant Pot® off. Return chicken to the pot and pour honey mixture on top. Stir to coat with sauce.
4. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 2 minutes. Allow 10 minutes for pressure to build.
5. Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Serve chicken sprinkled with green onions and sesame seeds.
