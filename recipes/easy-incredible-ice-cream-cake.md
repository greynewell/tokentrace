## Ingredients

- nonstick cooking spray
- 1 (15.25 ounce) package devil's food cake mix
- 1 cup water
- ½ cup oil
- 3 large eggs
- ½ gallon vanilla ice cream, slightly softened
- 2 cups chopped chocolate sandwich cookies (such as Oreo®)
- 1 (7.25 ounce) bottle chocolate shell topping (such as Magic Shell®)
- 2 cups heavy whipping cream
- 2 cups powdered sugar
- decorating icing (optional)
- candy sprinkles (optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly coat the bottom and sides of two 8-inch round cake pans.
2. Blend cake mix, water, oil, and eggs in a large bowl until moistened. Beat with a mixer on medium speed for 2 minutes. Pour into the prepared cake pans.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 32 to 38 minutes.
4. While the cake layers are baking, line a clean 8-inch round cake pan with plastic wrap, allowing the sides to hang over about 6 inches all the way around. Peel down the sides of the ice cream carton and slice off several big pieces; press them into the prepared cake pan. Wrap plastic over the top of the ice cream and continue to form until it's in an even layer. Freeze for 1 hour.
5. Remove cakes from the oven and cool for 10 to 15 minutes in the pans. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely, about 30 minutes.
6. Place one cake layer on a freezer-safe plate. Reserve remaining layer for another use (you can freeze it for up to 4 months.)
7. Combine chopped cookies and chocolate topping in a medium bowl. Spread cookie "crunchies" evenly on top of the cake layer. Invert frozen ice cream layer on top of cookie layer with the bottom (smooth side) up. Return to the freezer for 1 hour.
8. Add cream to bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment and whisk on medium speed. Gradually mix in powdered sugar until stiff peaks form. Spread icing evenly over cake and freeze for 1 more hour.
9. Decorate cake with icing and sprinkles and return to the freezer for at least 30 minutes (or up to 1 week) before serving.
