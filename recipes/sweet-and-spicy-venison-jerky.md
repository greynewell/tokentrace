## Ingredients

- ½ cup brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon ground black pepper
- 1 tablespoon onion powder
- 1 tablespoon garlic salt
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 3 tablespoons liquid smoke flavoring
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce
- ½ cup Worcestershire sauce
- ½ cup teriyaki sauce
- ⅓ cup soy sauce
- 1 pound venison, cut into 1/4 thick strips

## Instructions

1. Whisk teriyaki sauce, Worcestershire sauce, sugar, soy sauce, liquid smoke, pepper, onion powder, garlic salt, lemon juice, paprika, and hot pepper sauce together in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Add venison strips and toss to evenly coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for 24 hours, stirring it a few times as it marinates to ensure even absorption of marinade.
2. Remove venison strips from marinade and squeeze off excess. Discard remaining marinade. Arrange venison on the racks of a food dehydrator in a single layer.
3. Dry venison on High until dry but still pliable, about 4 hours. Jerky should bend without breaking. Store jerky in an airtight container or in a resealable plastic bag.
