## Ingredients

- 1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
- 3 tablespoons white sugar
- ½ cup butter
- ⅓ cup strawberry jam
- ⅛ teaspoon ground dried chipotle pepper  (Optional)
- ⅓ cup lemon curd

## Instructions

1. Combine flour and sugar in a medium bowl. Cut in butter with a pastry blender until mixture resembles fine crumbs and starts to cling. Form the mixture into a ball and knead until smooth.
2. Preheat an air fryer to 350 degrees F (190 degrees C).
3. Roll dough to 1/4-inch thickness on a lightly floured surface. Cut into 1/2-inch-wide "fries" about 3- to 4-inch long. Sprinkle with additional sugar.
4. Arrange fries in a single layer in the air fryer basket. Cook until lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Let cool in the basket until firm enough to transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Repeat with remaining dough.
5. To make strawberry "ketchup," press jam through a fine mesh sieve using the back of a spoon. Stir in ground chipotle. Whip the lemon curd to make it a dippable consistency for the "mustard."
6. Serve sugar cookie fries with the strawberry ketchup and lemon curd mustard.
