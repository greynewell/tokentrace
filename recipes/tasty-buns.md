## Ingredients

- 5 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 (.25 ounce) packages dry yeast
- 1 cup milk
- ¾ cup water
- ½ cup vegetable oil
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt

## Instructions

1. Stir 2 cups flour and yeast together in a large bowl. Heat milk, water, oil, sugar, and salt together in a microwave-safe bowl in the microwave until lukewarm; add to flour mixture and beat until smooth, about 3 minutes.
2. Mix in 2 cups remaining flour, then add up to 1 cup more flour as necessary to make a soft dough. Dust a flat surface with flour; turn dough out onto floured surface and let rest under a bowl for about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, lightly grease a baking sheet.
