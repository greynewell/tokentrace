## Ingredients

- 2 slices bread
- 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 2 teaspoons dried oregano
- 1 ½ teaspoons dried basil
- 1 ½ teaspoons minced garlic
- ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Place bread into a food processor and blend until crumbled. Transfer bread crumbs to a shallow bowl. Add 1 cup Parmesan cheese, oregano, basil, and garlic; stir to combine.
3. Press chicken breast halves into bread crumb mixture until coated; arrange on a large baking dish. Drizzle chicken with vegetable oil and sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese.
