## Ingredients

- nonstick cooking spray
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- 1 large egg, beaten
- 1 cup panko breadcrumbs, or more as needed
- 1 tablespoon red pepper flakes
- ¼ teaspoon ground chili powder
- ¼ teaspoon ground paprika
- ¼ teaspoon garlic powder
- ¼ teaspoon dried chives
- 1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast, cut into strips

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray.
2. Place flour into a bowl. Place egg into a second bowl. Pour panko, red pepper flakes, chili powder, paprika, garlic powder, and chives into a third bowl with a lid; mix until combined.
3. Dip chicken strips in flour to dust them, dredge in egg, let excess egg drop off, and then place in panko mixture. Cover with the lid and shake until chicken is well coated. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 10 to 12 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
