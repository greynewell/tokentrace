## Ingredients

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 1 teaspoon grated lemon zest
- 1 teaspoon grated orange zest
- ½  vanilla bean
- ½ cup unsalted butter
- 1  egg yolk
- 5 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
- 1 ¾ cups white sugar
- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ teaspoons grated lemon zest
- 1 ½ teaspoons grated orange zest
- ½  vanilla bean
- 5  eggs
- 2  egg yolks
- ¼ cup heavy cream

## Instructions

1. In a large bowl, combine 1 cup flour, 1/4 cup sugar, 1 teaspoon lemon peel, and 1 teaspoon orange peel. Split a 1-inch piece of vanilla bean; scrape seeds into flour mixture. Cut in butter until mixture resembles course crumbs. Add 1 egg yolk; stir until all flour is moistened. Gather dough into ball, wrap in wax paper, and refrigerate for 1 hour and 30 minutes.
2. Lightly butter a 9 inch springform pan. Roll dough on lightly floured surface to 1/8 inch thick; trim to a 10 inch circle. Reserve pastry trimmings. Press pastry circle into bottom and 1/2 inch up sides of a 9 inch buttered springform pan. Refrigerate 1 hour.
3. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Bake crust for 20 minutes, until lightly browned. Cool on wire rack.
4. Beat cream cheese, 1 3/4 cups sugar, 3 tablespoons flour, 1 1/2 teaspoons lemon peel and 1 1/2 teaspoons orange peel in large mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 10 minutes. Split a 1 inch piece of vanilla bean and scrape seeds into cream cheese mixture. Beat in 5 eggs and 2 egg yolks, 1 at a time, on medium speed. Stir in cream.
5. Increase oven temperature to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Roll out reserved pastry trimmings on lightly floured board; cut into strips 2 inches wide. Pat strips up side of pan, pressing dough lightly to baked crust. Pour filling into crust. Bake 15 minutes.
6. Reduce oven temperature to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). DO NOT OPEN OVEN DOOR! Bake until cheesecake is firm in center, about 50 minutes. Turn off oven; leave cheesecake in oven with door slightly open for 1 hour. Remove from oven, and cool completely on wire rack. Refrigerate at least 2 hours.
