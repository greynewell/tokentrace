## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups packed light brown sugar
- ¾ cup all-purpose flour
- ½ cup butter, chilled and diced
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 1 cup chopped walnuts
- 3 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ teaspoons baking powder
- ¾ teaspoon baking soda
- ¾ cup butter, room temperature
- 1 ½ cups white sugar
- 3  eggs
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 16 ounces plain low-fat yogurt
- 2  Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored and finely diced

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9- or 10-inch Bundt pan.
2. Make streusel: Mix together brown sugar, flour, and cinnamon in a medium bowl. Cut in butter with a fork until crumbly. Stir in walnuts and set aside.
3. Make cake: Stir together flour, baking powder, and baking soda in a medium bowl; set aside. Cream together sugar and butter in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in yogurt and vanilla. Stir in flour mixture just until blended.
4. Pour 3 cups batter into the prepared Bundt pan. Sprinkle with 1/4 of the streusel, then layer with apples. Sprinkle with 1/2 of the remaining streusel. Pour in remaining batter and top with remaining streusel. Lightly pat down top layer of streusel into batter.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 50 to 60 minutes. Cool in the pan on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Place cookie sheet over the pan and carefully invert both. Remove Bundt pan; let cake cool completely.
