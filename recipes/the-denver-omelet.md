## Ingredients

- 3  large eggs
- 1 tablespoon butter
- ¼ cup diced smoked ham
- 2 tablespoons diced onion
- 2 tablespoons diced green bell pepper
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- ⅓ cup shredded Cheddar cheese
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper

## Instructions

1. Beat eggs in a small bowl until just combined; do not overbeat.
2. Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add ham, onion, and bell pepper; season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir until onions soften and ham begins to caramelize, about 5 minutes.
3. Reduce heat to medium-low and pour in eggs. Mix briefly with a spatula while shaking the pan to ensure ingredients are evenly distributed. Quickly run the spatula along edges of omelet. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese and cayenne pepper over omelet.
4. Cook, shaking the pan occasionally, until top is still wet but not runny, about 5 minutes. Use a spatula to fold omelet in half and transfer it to a plate.
