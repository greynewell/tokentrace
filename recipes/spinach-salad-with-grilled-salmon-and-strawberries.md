## Ingredients

- 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 4 tablespoons high-quality balsamic vinegar
- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 pound salmon filets, with skin
- salt and pepper to taste
- 1 (5 ounce) package fresh baby spinach
- 1 medium red bell pepper, chopped
- 8 medium fresh mushrooms, sliced
- 16 large fresh strawberries, sliced
- 4 tablespoons chopped pecans
- 4 slices cooked bacon, crumbled

## Instructions

1. Combine olive oil, balsamic vinegar, Dijon mustard, salt, and pepper in a small bowl for the vinaigrette. Stir briskly to combine.
2. Brush salmon with 1 teaspoon of the vinaigrette on the cut side, and season with salt and pepper. Reserve the remaining vinaigrette.
3. Clean the grates of an outdoor grill and preheat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
4. Place the salmon on a grilling mat or fish grill basket on the hot grill, skin side down. Grill for about 10 minutes. Using a turner, carefully flip the salmon, or turn the grill basket, and cook for 4 to 5 minutes more. Salmon should flake easily with a fork when done. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
5. Transfer salmon to a plate, tent with foil, and allow to rest while preparing the salad.
6. Combine spinach, red bell pepper, mushrooms, strawberries, and reserved vinaigrette in a large bowl. Toss to combine. Remove skin from salmon and flake.
7. Divide salad among individual plates, top with flaked salmon, and garnish with chopped pecans and crumbled bacon.
