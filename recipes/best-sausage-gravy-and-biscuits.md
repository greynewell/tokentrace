## Ingredients

- 1 pound bulk country sausage
- 2 tablespoons butter
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- 2 ½ cups milk, or more as needed
- 2 teaspoons hot sauce
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 6 medium (blank)s hot biscuits, split

## Instructions

1. Heat sausage in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook, crumbling with a spoon and stirring often, until browned and cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes.
2. Add butter to skillet and melt. Sprinkle flour evenly over skillet and stir for 1 minute. Whisk in 2 1/2 cups milk and scrape up any bits off the bottom of the skillet. Bring mixture to a simmer.
