## Ingredients

- 2 ½ pounds lobster
- 1 tablespoon butter, melted
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives
- 1 tablespoon hot pepper sauce (such as Tabasco®)
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 3 large jalapeno peppers, halved lengthwise and seeded
- 6 slices thinly sliced bacon

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
2. Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat.

4. Break lobster claws and tail removing as much meat as possible.
5. Discard shells.
6. Roughly chop the meat and transfer to a bowl.
7. Mix melted butter, chives, and hot sauce with the lobster; season with salt and pepper.
8. Spoon mixture into the jalapeno halves and wrap each tightly with a slice of bacon, wrapping three times around each popper and trimming bacon so there is no excess hanging off the edges.
