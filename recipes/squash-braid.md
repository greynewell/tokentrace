## Ingredients

- 1  butternut squash- peeled, seeded and cubed
- 1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
- 2 tablespoons warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)

- 3 tablespoons brown sugar
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 3 cups all-purpose flour

## Instructions

1. In a large saucepan, cover peeled and chopped squash with water.
2. Bring water to a boil and cook until tender, about 15 to 20 minutes.
3. Let cool and mash.
4. Reserve 1 cup for use in this recipe and freeze remainder for later use.
5. In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water.
6. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.
7. In a large bowl, combine the yeast mixture with milk, butter, 1 cup mashed squash, 1 egg, brown sugar, salt and 2 cups flour; stir well to combine.
8. Stir in the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, beating well after each addition.
9. When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.
10. Lightly oil a large bowl, place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil.
11. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.

13. Divide into 6 equal pieces and roll each into a rope about 18 inches long.
14. Take 3 ropes, pinch ends together and then braid ropes together.
