## Ingredients

- ½ cup balsamic vinegar
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard, or more to taste
- 1 clove garlic, or more to taste, minced
- salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
- 4 large skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- 1 pint cherry tomatoes, halved
- 1  lemon, zested and juiced

## Instructions

1. Mix balsamic vinegar, olive oil, mustard, and garlic together in an oven-safe baking dish; season with salt and pepper. Place the chicken breasts in the vinegar mixture.
2. Marinate chicken in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours.
3. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
4. Roast chicken in the preheated oven for about 30 minutes.
