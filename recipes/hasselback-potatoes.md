## Ingredients

- 4 (8 ounce) baking potatoes
- 2 tablespoons butter, melted
- salt and pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons finely grated fresh Romano cheese
- 1 tablespoon seasoned dry bread crumbs

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Peel potatoes and place in a bowl of cold water to prevent browning.
3. One at a time, dry potatoes and place in a large wooden or metal serving spoon. Using a sharp knife, slice potato crosswise at 1/8-inch intervals, cutting until the knife touches the spoon, being careful not to cut all the way through so the potato stays intact.
4. Arrange potatoes cut-side up in a shallow baking dish or small roasting pan. Drizzle with 1/2 of the melted butter, then season with salt and pepper.
5. Bake in the preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes; drizzle with remaining butter and sprinkle Romano cheese and bread crumbs on top. Season with a little more salt and pepper and bake until nicely browned, about 20 minutes.
