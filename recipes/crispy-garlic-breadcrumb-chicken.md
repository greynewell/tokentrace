## Ingredients

- 2 large skinless, boneless chicken breasts
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- cayenne pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter
- ½ cup panko bread crumbs
- 3 cloves garlic, finely crushed
- 1 tablespoon finely chopped Italian parsley
- 2 tablespoons grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
- 1 tablespoon mayonnaise
- 1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar
- 1 ½ teaspoons Dijon mustard
- ¼ cup chicken broth
- ⅓ cup chicken broth
- 1  lemon, juiced
- 1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
2. Season chicken breasts on both sides with salt, black pepper, and cayenne.
3. Heat olive oil in an oven-safe skillet over high heat. Add chicken breasts. Sear, untouched, until bottoms release from the pan, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook for 2 minutes more.
4. Reduce heat to medium-low. Add butter and let melt. Add panko bread crumbs. Cook and stir until breadcrumbs start to turn golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Turn off heat and add parsley and Parmigiano-Reggiano. Set breading aside.
5. Combine mayonnaise, balsamic vinegar, and Dijon mustard in a small bowl. Spread 'glue' over the top and sides of the chicken breasts. Spoon over the the breadcrumb mixture. Use a spatula to transfer chicken breasts back to the skillet. Pour chicken broth around the chicken.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, 10 to 12 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the chicken should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Transfer chicken to a plate and let rest while you make the pan sauce.
7. Pour chicken broth and lemon juice into the pan. Bring to a boil over high heat and add balsamic vinegar. Boil until sauce is reduced, about 2 minutes. Strain sauce and spoon around chicken.
