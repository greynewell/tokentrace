## Ingredients

- 6 ounces cream cheese, softened
- 1 cup butter
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- ⅛ teaspoon salt
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 (21 ounce) can apple pie filling
- 2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease cookie sheets.
2. Using a pastry blender or food processor, cut butter into cream cheese.
3. In a small bowl, sift dry ingredients together except for confectioners' sugar.
4. Work dry ingredients into butter/cream cheese mixture until you have an even, mealy texture.
5. Knead to form a stiff dough. If the dough gets too soft, refrigerate for about five minutes before continuing.
6. Roll dough to 1/4-inch thickness.
7. Using a cookie cutter or glass, cut into about 3 inch diameter cookies. Keep re-rolling dough until you have used it all. Use your thumb to make a depression in each cookie. Place a 1/2 teaspoon of filling in the depression.
8. Bake for about 20 minutes (until lightly golden). Let cool on a cookie rack. Dust lightly with confectioners' sugar. Store in an airtight container
