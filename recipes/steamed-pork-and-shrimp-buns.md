## Ingredients

- 4 tablespoons white sugar
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 3 teaspoons active dry yeast
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1 ½ cups very warm water
- 2 tablespoons warm milk
- 4 cups all-purpose flour, or as needed
- 1 (8 ounce) can sliced water chestnuts, drained
- 1 cup cooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 2 stalks green onions, chopped, or more to taste
- 1 pound ground pork
- 1 cup Chinese barbeque sauce

## Instructions

1. Dissolve sugar, butter, yeast, and salt into the warm water and milk. Stir in as much flour as you can until you get smooth, elastic dough. If the dough is sticky, add more flour. If the loaf is too dry, add more milk and knead until it's the right consistency; smooth and elastic. Let rest until doubled in size, 30 to 60 minutes.
2. While dough rests, mince the water chestnuts, shrimp, and green onions.
3. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir pork in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add barbecue sauce, shrimp, water chestnuts, and green onions; saute until heated through, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat.
4. Take a handful of dough and flatten it in your hand. Add a spoonful of the filling and seal the dough around the filling by pressing with your fingers, making sure you have a nice, round bun. Set the bun on the counter as you continue making buns. Allow buns to rise for 20 minutes.
5. Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add buns in batches, about 1 inch apart; cover, and steam until cooked through, about 20 minutes. Serve hot.
