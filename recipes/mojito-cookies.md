## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups white sugar
- 1 cup butter
- 3  limes, zested
- 2  eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon mint extract
- 1 teaspoon rum extract, or more to taste
- 2 ¾ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Cream sugar, butter, and lime zest together in a medium mixing bowl with an electric mixer until fluffy. Add eggs, fully incorporating 1 at a time. Mix in vanilla extract, mint extract, and rum extract.
3. Sift flour, baking powder, and salt together in a separate bowl. Mix into the egg mixture about 1/3 at a time, making sure flour is fully incorporated before adding the next batch.
4. Let chill in a refrigerator to allow the lime zest to impart greater flavor into the batter, up to 1 hour. Remove and allow to return to room temperature, about 20 minutes.
5. Spoon tablespoons of batter onto ungreased baking sheets, leaving about 2 inches between each cookie.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until edges are light golden brown, about 10 minutes, turning halfway through baking time. Allow to cool on the cookie sheets.
