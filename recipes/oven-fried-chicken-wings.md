## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese (such as Kraft®)
- 1 cup seasoned bread crumbs
- ⅛ teaspoon garlic powder
- ⅛ teaspoon onion powder
- ⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 pinch salt
- 5 pounds chicken wings, tips discarded
- ½ cup melted butter

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and generously spray with cooking spray.
2. Mix Parmesan cheese, bread crumbs, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, and salt in a bowl.
3. Dip chicken wings in melted butter; press into bread crumb mixture until well-coated. Arrange wings on the prepared baking dish.
4. Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Flip chicken wings and continue baking until evenly browned and no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
