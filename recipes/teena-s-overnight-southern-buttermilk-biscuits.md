## Ingredients

- 4 cups self-rising flour
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- ⅔ cup shortening
- 2 cups buttermilk

## Instructions

1. Sift together the flour and sugar in a large bowl. Cut in the shortening until the mixture has a fine crumb or cornmeal texture. Stir in the buttermilk with a fork until a soft dough forms.
2. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface, pulling off any pieces sticking inside the bowl. Gather dough into a ball and knead about 20 times, until smooth and elastic. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.
3. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
4. Working on a floured surface, roll or pat the dough out to 1 inch thickness. Cut into rounds with a 2 inch biscuit cutter, or the floured rim of a glass, by pressing straight down and up. Twisting the cutter will prevent the biscuits from rising as high. Place biscuits about 1 inch apart on an ungreased baking sheet, and allow to rest a few minutes.
5. Bake in preheated oven until lightly brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool on a wire rack. Serve warm.
