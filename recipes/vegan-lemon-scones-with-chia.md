## Ingredients

- 1 cup whole wheat flour
- 1 cup oat flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ¼ teaspoon salt

- 3 tablespoons coconut oil

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Combine whole wheat flour, oat flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, chia seeds, and white sugar in a bowl. Mix in coconut oil in until the mixture is crumbly. Stir in soy milk, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, and 2 tablespoons lemon zest until a dough forms.
