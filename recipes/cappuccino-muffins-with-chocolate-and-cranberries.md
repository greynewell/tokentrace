## Ingredients

- 2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ½ cup cocoa powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ cup semisweet chocolate chips
- ½ cup dried cranberries
- 1 teaspoon minced orange zest
- ½ cup butter, softened
- ½ cup white sugar
- ½ cup brown sugar
- 1 cup sour cream
- ¾ cup milk
- 2  eggs
- 2 tablespoons instant coffee granules

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper liners.
2. Gently stir flour, baking powder, baking soda, cocoa powder, salt, chocolate chips, dried cranberries, and orange zest in a bowl until thoroughly combined.
