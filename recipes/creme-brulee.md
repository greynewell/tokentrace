## Ingredients

- 6  egg yolks
- 6 tablespoons white sugar, divided
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 ½ cups heavy cream
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar

2. Whisk egg yolks, 4 tablespoons white sugar, and vanilla extract in a mixing bowl until thick and creamy; set aside.
3. Pour cream into a saucepan and stir over low heat until it almost comes to a boil. Whisk cream into egg yolk mixture; beat until combined.
