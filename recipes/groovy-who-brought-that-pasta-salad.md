## Ingredients

- 1 pound tri-color rotini pasta
- ½ cup water, divided
- 5 drops red food coloring
- 5 drops green food coloring
- 5 drops blue food coloring
- 5 drops yellow food coloring
- 1 cup white sugar
- ¾ cup cider vinegar
- ½ cup vegetable oil
- 3 tablespoons dried parsley flakes, or to taste
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 small onion, grated
- ½  green bell pepper, diced
- 4  carrots, grated

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain and rinse under cold water.
2. Put 2 tablespoons water in each of 4 resealable plastic bags; add red food coloring to a bag. Add green food coloring to second bag. Add blue food coloring to third bag. Add yellow food coloring to fourth bag.
3. Divide rotini among the four bags; squeeze bag to evenly color rotini. Set aside to allow color to saturate, about 10 minutes. Transfer pasta to a large bowl.
4. Whisk sugar, vinegar, oil, parsley, salt, garlic powder, and pepper together in a bowl until sugar is dissolved into dressing.
5. Mix onion, green bell pepper, and carrots into pasta. Drizzle dressing over pasta mixture; toss to coat. Refrigerate until flavors blend, at least 2 hours.
