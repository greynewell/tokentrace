## Ingredients

- 5 pounds russet baking potatoes
- ¼ cup salted butter, melted
- ⅓ cup milk
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1 pinch ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Wash and scrub potatoes. Place potatoes on the center rack and bake until they are soft in the center, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven and cool to the touch, about 15 minutes.
3. Cut potatoes in half and remove potato flesh from the skin, leaving the skin intact. Place potato flesh in a large bowl and beat until fluffy using an electric mixer. Add butter, milk, salt, and pepper and beat until smooth.
4. Spoon potato mixture into a pastry bag fitted with a large tip and pipe back into the potato skins. Sprinkle with fresh chives. Transfer to freezer bags and freeze until ready to use.
