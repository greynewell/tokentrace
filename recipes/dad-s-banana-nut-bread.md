- ½ cup butter, softened
- 1 cup white sugar
- 2  eggs
- 2  very ripe bananas, mashed
- 1 cup self-rising flour
- ¼ cup flax seed meal
- ½ cup chopped walnuts  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat an oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan, or line a muffin pan with cupcake liners.
2. In a mixing bowl, beat the butter and sugar with an electric mixer until light and fluffy.
