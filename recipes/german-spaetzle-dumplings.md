## Ingredients

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- ¼ cup milk
- 2  eggs
- ½ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1 pinch freshly ground white pepper
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 gallon hot water
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

## Instructions

1. Fill a large pot halfway full with water and bring to a boil. Adjust heat so water just simmers.
