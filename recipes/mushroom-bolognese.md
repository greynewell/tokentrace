## Ingredients

- 1 ½ teaspoons butter
- 1 ¼ teaspoons olive oil
- ½ pound portobello mushrooms, chopped
- ¼ cup chopped onion
- ¼ cup chopped carrot
- 2 tablespoons chopped celery
- 2 tablespoons white wine
- ½ cup beef broth
- 1 ¼ teaspoons tomato paste
- 1 teaspoon butter
- 2 ounces enoki mushrooms
- 3 ½ tablespoons heavy cream
- 1 pinch ground nutmeg
- salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Melt 1 1/2 teaspoon of butter with olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
2. Cook and stir the portobello mushrooms, onion, carrot, and celery until the vegetables are softened and beginning to brown, about 8 minutes.
3. Transfer the mushroom mixture to a large saucepan.
4. Pour the white wine into the skillet and bring to a boil, dissolving any browned flavor bits from the bottom of the skillet.
5. Allow the wine to cook for about 2 minutes, until reduced, and pour into the saucepan.
6. Stir the beef broth and tomato paste into the mixture in the saucepan, bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to low.
7. Simmer, partially covered, until the beef broth has reduced and the vegetables are very tender, about 35 minutes.
8. Melt 1 teaspoon of butter in the original skillet, and cook and stir the enoki mushrooms until lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes.
9. Remove the enoki, and chop.
10. Stir the chopped enoki mushrooms into the sauce and simmer for about 10 minutes; stir in the heavy cream, and allow to heat through (do not boil).
11. Season with nutmeg, salt, and pepper to taste.
