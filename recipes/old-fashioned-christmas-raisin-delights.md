## Ingredients

- 3 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ⅔ cup butter, softened
- ¾ cup packed brown sugar
- ¾ cup white sugar
- 2  eggs
- ⅓ cup milk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 1 ¾ cups raisins
- 1 cup packed brown sugar
- 1 cup water
- 1 pinch salt
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice
- 1 ½ tablespoons cornstarch
- 2 tablespoons water
- ½ cup chopped walnuts

## Instructions

1. To Make The Dough: Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt together; set aside.
2. Cream the butter with 3/4 cup of the brown sugar and the white sugar. Beat in the eggs, milk and vanilla. Mix at high speed for 2 minutes, then reduce speed and gradually blend in the flour mixture. Cover and refrigerate dough for at least 3 hours.
3. To Make Raisin Filling: Grind the raisins. In a medium saucepan combine the ground raisins, 1 cup brown sugar, 1 cup water, salt and lemon juice. Bring to a boil, and simmer for 3 minutes.
4. Combine the cornstarch and 2 tablespoons of the water and mix until smooth. Add to the raisin mixture and continue to simmer until thick. Remove from heat and let cool. Once cool, stir in the chopped nuts.
5. Preheat Oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease baking sheets.
6. On a floured surface, roll out the chilled dough to 1/8 inch thick. Cut into 2 3/4 inch rounds. Place rounds on the prepared baking sheet. Place a heaping teaspoon of the raisin filling on the cookie round and top with another round. Crimp the edges closed.
7. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 8 minutes. Allow cookies to cool on sheet until just barely warm.
