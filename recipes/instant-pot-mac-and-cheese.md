- 1 (16 ounce) package elbow macaroni
- 1 quart chicken stock
- ½ teaspoon salt

- ½ teaspoon liquid smoke flavoring
- ½ teaspoon paprika
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 cup milk
- 8 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese

## Instructions

1. Combine macaroni, chicken stock, salt, dry mustard, liquid smoke, paprika, pepper, and garlic powder in a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot). Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 4 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
