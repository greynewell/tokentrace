## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1  onion, finely chopped
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth
- 1 (2 pound) butternut squash - peeled, seeded, and cut into 1-inch cubes
- 1  orange, juiced
- 1  orange, juiced and zested
- 3 tablespoons sour cream
- salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Melt butter in a large saucepan or soup pot over medium heat, and cook and stir the onion until translucent, about 5 minutes. Pour in the chicken broth, and stir in the butternut squash cubes, orange juice, and orange zest. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until the squash cubes are tender, 15 to 20 minutes.
2. Pour the soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until smooth and pour back into the pot. Alternately, you can use a stick blender and puree the soup right in the cooking pot. Whisk in sour cream until smooth, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Heat over medium-low heat until almost simmering, and serve hot.
