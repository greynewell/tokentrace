## Ingredients

- 8 ounces mozzarella cheese pearls
- 1 ½ cups cherry tomatoes, halved
- ¼ cup finely sliced fresh basil leaves
- ¼ cup olive oil
- ¼ cup balsamic vinegar
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ¼ cup balsamic vinegar
- ¼ cup mayonnaise
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic
- ½ teaspoon onion powder
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 (12 inch) flour tortilla
- ¼ cup baby spinach leaves
- 4 slices thinly sliced cooked deli turkey
- 2 slices Muenster cheese
- 4  fresh raspberries, roughly chopped, or more to taste
- ¼ cup sugar snap peas
- 1 ounce lightly salted almonds

## Instructions

1. Combine mozzarella pearls, tomatoes, and basil in a bowl; set aside. Whisk olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and garlic together in another bowl. Pour over tomato mixture and stir gently to coat. Season with salt and pepper. Chill for 1 hour.
2. In the meantime, whisk balsamic vinegar, mayonnaise, honey, garlic, onion powder, salt, and pepper together for dressing in a small bowl until smooth. Transfer to a jar or other container and refrigerate until ready to use.
3. Drizzle tortilla with some of the creamy balsamic vinaigrette, layer with baby spinach, sliced turkey, and Muenster cheese. Sprinkle with chopped raspberries. Drizzle with more balsamic vinaigrette if desired. Roll tortilla and fillings gently and tightly starting with 1 edge into a long tube. Cut into approximately 1-inch slices, securing with toothpicks if needed.
4. Add prepared roll-ups and caprese salad to bento boxes. Add sugar snap peas and almonds, using a small container if needed. Add extra balsamic dressing for dipping, if desired.
