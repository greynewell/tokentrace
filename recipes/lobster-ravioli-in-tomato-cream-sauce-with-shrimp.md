## Ingredients

- ½ pound unpeeled large shrimp
- 1  yellow onion, quartered
- 2 stalks celery with leaves, cut into pieces
- 1  lemon, halved
- 1 tablespoon dried basil
- 1 tablespoon dried oregano
- 1 tablespoon dried thyme
- 2 tablespoons whole black peppercorns
- ½ cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
- 3 cups water
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
- 1  shallot, minced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 teaspoons lemon zest
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 cup white wine
- 1 cup canned petite diced tomatoes
- ½ cup heavy cream
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 16  lobster ravioli
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
- 1 teaspoon lemon zest

## Instructions

1. Peel and devein shrimp, reserving shells and heads. Chop shrimp into bite-sized pieces.
2. To make shrimp stock, combine shrimp shells and heads, onion, and celery in a large pot. Squeeze lemon juice into the pot, then add lemon halves as well. Add dried basil, oregano, thyme, peppercorns, parsley, and water. Cover the pot and bring it to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 1 hour, skimming away any foam or impurities that have risen to the surface. Strain shrimp stock and set aside.
3. Heat butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook shrimp pieces until pink and almost cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove and set aside. Add shallots to the pan; cook and stir until shallots have softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes.
4. Stir in garlic, lemon zest, salt, and ground pepper. Cook for thirty seconds, then add white wine. Bring to a boil and cook until white wine is reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Add shrimp stock to the pan, bring it to a boil, and simmer until sauce is reduced by half, about 15 minutes.
5. Meanwhile, fill a large pot with heavily salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once water is boiling, stir in ravioli, and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, occasionally stirring, until ravioli float to the top and filling is hot, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain well, reserving a little pasta-cooking water to thin sauce, if necessary.
6. Stir diced tomatoes and cream into shrimp sauce and heat through. Return shrimp to the pan, taste sauce, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Fold ravioli into sauce.
7. Place four ravioli onto each of the four warmed pasta bowls or plates and top with sauce. Garnish pasta with chopped parsley and lemon zest.
