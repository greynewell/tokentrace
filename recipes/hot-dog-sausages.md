## Ingredients

- 1 ¼ pounds lean ground beef
- ¼ pound ground pork
- 4 teaspoons kosher salt
- 1 tablespoon paprika
- 2 teaspoons ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon granulated onion powder
- 1 teaspoon granulated garlic
- ½ teaspoon smoked paprika
- ⅓ cup ice water
- 4  hot dog buns, split and toasted

## Instructions

1. Place ground beef, ground pork, salt, paprika, black pepper, granulated onion, granulated garlic, smoked paprika, and ice water in a bowl.
2. Mix together with fingers until well blended and mixture is dense and solid, about 4 minutes.
3. It's okay to overmix.
4. Wrap dough in plastic; refrigerate at least 2 hours or overnight.
5. Place a sheet of plastic wrap on a work surface.
6. Have a bowl of ice water nearby to keep your hands wet and cold.
7. Place 1/4 of the mixture on the plastic wrap.
8. Roughly shape meat into a thick roll and wrap with the plastic.
9. Shape into a thinner roll about as long as a hot dog bun.
10. You can unroll the plastic and "fine tune" the sausage shape after wetting your hands in ice water.
11. Rewrap in plastic and place on a dish; repeat for the remaining sausages.
12. Refrigerate until ready to cook.
13. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
14. Carefully place sausages on grill and let them cook undisturbed for about 2 minutes to seal the bottom edge.
15. Gently turn completely over to brown the opposite side; cook until brown, about 2 minutes.
16. Brown all surfaces, turning carefully to avoid breaking the sausages, about 5 minutes more.
17. Remove sausages from grill and serve on toasted hot dog buns.
