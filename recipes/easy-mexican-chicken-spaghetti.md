## Ingredients

- 1 pound spaghetti
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 small yellow onion, diced
- 3  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into bite-size pieces, or more to taste
- 1 (10.75 ounce) can  cream of mushroom soup
- 1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.
2. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
3. Heat olive oil in an oven-proof skillet over medium heat; cook and stir garlic until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add onion; cook and stir until onion begins to soften, about 2 minutes. Add chicken; cook and stir until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes.
4. Mix cream of mushroom soup and diced tomatoes with green chile peppers into chicken mixture. Mix spaghetti into chicken mixture and top with Colby-Monterey Jack cheese.
5. Place the skillet in the preheated oven and bake until cheese is melted and slightly brown, 15 to 20 minutes.
