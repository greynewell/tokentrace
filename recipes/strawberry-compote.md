## Ingredients

- 4 cups strawberries, chopped
- ½ cup white sugar
- 2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar
- ⅛ teaspoon salt

## Instructions

1. Combine chopped strawberries, sugar, balsamic vinegar, and salt in a saucepan; stir to coat evenly. Let sit until berries have released their juices, about 10 minutes.
2. Bring to a light boil over medium heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until strawberries are soft and compote has thickened, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool slightly; serve warm or cool. Compote will thicken further as it cools.
