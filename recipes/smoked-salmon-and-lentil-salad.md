## Ingredients

- 3 cups water
- 1 ½ cups dry lentils
- 1  bouquet garni
- 10 ounces smoked salmon, or more to taste
- ½ large red onion, minced
- 1 tablespoon snipped fresh chives
- ¼ cup olive oil
- 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Combine water, lentils, and bouquet garni in a large saucepan; bring to a boil.

Remove from the heat and let lentils cool in the pan. Discard bouquet garni.
2. Cut salmon into small strips, no longer than 1/2 inch long. Place in a large bowl with onion and chives. Add cooled lentils.
3. Whisk olive oil, vinegar, mustard, salt, and pepper together in a small bowl. Add to the lentil mixture and stir until well combined. Serve immediately or refrigerate until flavors have blended, 2 to 3 hours.
