## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Place 1 round of frozen puff pastry, parchment-side down, on a baking sheet.
3. Remove 1 piece of parchment from the other puff pastry round.
4. Place a plate upside-down onto the pastry.
5. Run a knife along the rim to cut a border out of the circle.
6. Beat egg and water together; brush over the puff pastry on the baking sheet.
7. Carefully remove the outer ring from the other round and line it over the edges of the brushed pastry.
8. Brush more egg wash over the border.
9. Prick bottom crust with a fork.
10. Bake in the preheated oven until light golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes.
11. Immediately press the bottom of a fork onto the bottom crust to flatten it.
