## Ingredients

- 12  fresh chicken wing drumettes
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 tablespoon butter
- ¼ cup honey
- 2 teaspoons rice vinegar
- 1 tablespoon sriracha sauce

## Instructions

1. Preheat an air fryer to 360 degrees F (182 degrees C).
2. Place chicken wings in a bowl and sprinkle with salt and garlic powder, tossing to coat.
3. Place wings in the air fryer basket. Set timer for 25 minutes and cook wings, shaking basket every 7 to 8 minutes. When timer ends, turn air fryer off and let wings stand in the basket for 5 minutes more.
4. Meanwhile, melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Whisk honey, rice vinegar, and sriracha sauce into butter and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer sauce over medium-low heat for 8 to 10 minutes, whisking occasionally. Turn off heat and set aside; sauce will thicken as it cools.
5. Toss cooked wings and sauce together in a bowl. Reserve extra sauce to serve alongside wings.
