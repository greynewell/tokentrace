## Ingredients

- 1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie
- ½ cup white sugar
- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon lemon zest
- 5 cups peeled and sliced pears
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Place a baking sheet on the bottom oven rack. Line the bottom and sides of a 9-inch pie plate with one pie crust. Set second crust aside.
2. Combine sugar, flour, cinnamon, lemon zest, and salt in a mixing bowl.
3. Arrange pear slices in layers in prepared crust, sprinkling sugar mixture over each layer. Dot with butter and sprinkle with lemon juice.
4. Moisten the rim of bottom crust with some water, then cover filling with remaining pie crust and flute the edges to seal; trim off excess pastry and cut several slits in top crust to allow steam to escape.
5. Bake in the preheated oven on the baking sheet for 10 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C); bake until crust is golden brown and filling is bubbly, 35 to 40 minutes longer. Allow to cool several hours before serving.
