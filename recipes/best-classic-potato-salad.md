## Ingredients

- 5 pounds russet potatoes, peeled
- 4 teaspoons kosher salt, divided, or to taste
- 4 large eggs
- 1 cup mayonnaise
- ⅓ cup sour cream
- 3 tablespoons yellow mustard
- 5 stalks green onions, sliced (white and green parts)
- 2 stalks celery, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill
- ½ cup chopped spicy sweet dill pickles (such as Wickles™), plus 2 teaspoons pickle juice
- ¾ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon ground paprika
- ¼ cup sliced green olives with pimientos

## Instructions

1. Cut potatoes into 1 1/2-inch pieces. Place in a large pot and add water to cover by 2 inches. Add 3 teaspoons salt and eggs; bring to a boil over medium-high heat.
2. Reduce heat and simmer 9 minutes. Remove eggs to an ice bath. Drain potatoes when fork-tender; they may need another minute or so.
3. Peel and chop eggs and set aside.
4. Combine mayonnaise, sour cream, mustard, onions, celery, dill, pickles, juice and pepper in a large bowl; stir to combine. Stir in potatoes and eggs until well blended, mashing potatoes very slightly. Check for seasoning and add up to 1 teaspoon salt if desired.
5. Transfer to a serving bowl, sprinkle with paprika, and garnish with olives. Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours or overnight.
