## Ingredients

- 12 ⅜ cups all-purpose flour
- 2 cups white sugar
- 5 tablespoons anise seed
- ½ cup warm water
- 2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
- 2 cups warm milk
- 8  eggs, at room temperature
- ½ cup butter, melted

## Instructions

1. Combine flour, sugar, and anise seed together in a very large bowl; create a well in the center.

5. Punch dough down and divide into 6 portions. Mold each portion into a round shape and place each in a prepared pan. Cover pans and let rise for 1 hour more.
6. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
7. Bake in the preheated oven until bread is cooked through, 45 to 50 minutes.
