## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
- 1 tablespoon active dry yeast
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 4 cups bread flour

## Instructions

1. Stir together warm water, sugar, and yeast in a large bowl. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.
2. Add 2 cups flour, oil, and salt to the yeast mixture. Stir in the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until the dough has pulled away from the sides of the bowl. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.
3. Lightly oil a large bowl, place the dough in the bowl, and turn to coat. Cover with a damp cloth, and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
4. Deflate the dough, and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough into 16 equal pieces, and form into round balls. Lightly grease 2 baking sheets; place rolls on prepared sheets at least 2 inches apart and cover with a damp cloth. Let rise until doubled in volume, about 40 minutes.
5. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
6. Bake rolls in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 18 to 20 minutes.
