## Ingredients

- 2 (4.8 ounce) packages graham crackers
- 2 sticks salted butter, melted
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 1 (12 ounce) package semisweet chocolate chips
- ½ cup chocolate-hazelnut spread (such as Nutella®)
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 3 cups mini marshmallows

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 9x13-inch baking pan with aluminum foil, leaving a 2-inch overhang on 2 sides. Grease the foil.
2. Break graham crackers into the bowl of a food processor. Process into crumbs. Add melted butter and sugar; process until mixture resembles wet sand.
3. Pour graham cracker mixture into the prepared baking pan. Press down flat using the bottom of a glass.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until crust is set, 12 to 15 minutes.
5. Place chocolate chips in the top of a double boiler over simmering water. Stir frequently, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, until chocolate is melted, about 5 minutes. Mix in chocolate-hazelnut spread and cinnamon.
6. Pour chocolate mixture over the crust; level out with a spoon. Press marshmallows into the chocolate, covering it completely.
7. Place baking pan in the refrigerator until chocolate firms up, about 2 hours.
8. Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Toast marshmallows under the broiler for 1 to 2 minutes. Cut s'mores into bars.
