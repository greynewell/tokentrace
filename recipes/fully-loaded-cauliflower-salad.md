## Ingredients

- 4 slices bacon
- 1 head cauliflower, chopped into bite size pieces
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ½ cup fat-free sour cream
- ½ cup reduced-fat mayonnaise
- 4 ounces shredded sharp white Cheddar cheese
- 4  green onions, chopped
- 1 bunch chopped fresh chives
- 2 dashes hot pepper sauce (such as Frank's RedHot®)
- ¼ teaspoon paprika

## Instructions

1. Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate. When cool, crumble into bacon bits.
2. Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with foil.
3. Combine the cauliflower, olive oil, garlic, salt, and black pepper in large bowl. Spread the cauliflower on the foil-lined baking sheet, and roast in the preheated oven until the cauliflower is lightly browned, about 15 to 20 minutes. Cool.
4. Place the cooled roasted cauliflower, sour cream, and mayonnaise in a large bowl; stir. Fold in the shredded Cheddar cheese, bacon bits, green onion, chives, pepper sauce, and paprika. Adjust salt and black pepper. Refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours before serving.
