## Ingredients

- 2  egg whites
- ⅛ teaspoon salt
- ⅛ teaspoon cream of tartar
- ½ cup white sugar
- 2  peppermint candy canes, crushed

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C). Line 2 cookie sheets with foil.
2. In a large glass or metal mixing bowl, beat egg whites, salt, and cream of tartar to soft peaks. Gradually add sugar, continuing to beat until whites form stiff peaks. Drop by spoonfuls 1 inch apart on the prepared cookie sheets. Sprinkle crushed peppermint candy over the cookies.
