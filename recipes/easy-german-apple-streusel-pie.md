## Ingredients

- 4 large apples - peeled, cored, and thinly sliced
- 1 pinch ground cinnamon
- 7 ounces unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 1 cup white sugar
- 3 teaspoons vanilla sugar
- 1  egg
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 3 ½ teaspoons baking powder

## Instructions

1. Combine apple slices and cinnamon in a saucepan and cook over low heat for 10 minutes. If necessary, add a tiny bit of water so apples don't burn. Remove from heat and set aside to cool.
2. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 10-inch springform pan with butter
3. Combine butter, sugar, vanilla sugar, and egg in a large bowl; beat using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Mix flour and baking powder in a separate bowl. Add 2/3 of flour mixture, 1 tablespoon at a time, to butter mixture and beat on low speed. Add remaining flour mixture and mix in by hand to make a crumbly dough.
4. Transfer 1/2 the dough into the prepared springform pan and press down to create a bottom crust. Add apple slices, leaving a small space around the edges. Crumble remaining dough evenly on top.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until streusel and crust are lightly browned, about 50 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Run a table knife around the edges to loosen. Carefully transfer to a serving plate or cooling rack.
