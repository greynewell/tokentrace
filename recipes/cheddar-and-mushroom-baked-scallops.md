## Ingredients

- 2 teaspoons butter
- 1 pound scallops
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- ½ pound mushrooms, sliced
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 cup milk
- 1 ⅓ cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
- 2 slices bread, toasted and crumbled
- ½ cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese

## Instructions

1. Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Melt 2 teaspoons butter in a large, oven proof skillet over medium-high heat. Place scallops in the melted butter and cook until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Remove the scallops from the pan and set aside. In the same skillet, cook and stir the onions and mushrooms over medium-high heat until soft, about 5 minutes. Remove the mushrooms and onions from the skillet and set aside with the scallops.
3. Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter in the skillet. Stir in the flour, and cook over medium heat for 2 minutes. Pour the milk into the pan while whisking vigorously. Continue to cook and stir the sauce until thickened, about 5 minutes. Add the cheese and stir until melted. Remove the cheese sauce from the heat; stir the browned scallops, onions, and mushrooms into the sauce.
4. Transfer the skillet into the preheated oven and bake until heated through and bubbly, about 20 minutes. Spread the toasted bread crumbs and grated cheese over the top of the baked cheddar and mushroom scallops to serve.
