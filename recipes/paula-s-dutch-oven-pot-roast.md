## Ingredients

- 1 (2 pound) boneless beef chuck roast
- 1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour, or as needed
- ½ cup vegetable oil (such as Wesson®)
- 2 (14 ounce) cans beef broth
- ⅔ cup dry white wine
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 1 (1.25 ounce) package beef with onion soup mix
- 1 teaspoon dried marjoram
- 4 dashes Worcestershire sauce
- 2 leaf (blank)s bay leaves
- 2 cups water to cover
- 1 (16 ounce) package baby carrots
- 2 medium potatoes, peeled and quartered, or more to taste

## Instructions

1. Season roast with salt and pepper and coat with 2 tablespoons flour. Heat oil in a large 6- to 8-quart Dutch oven. Brown the roast on all sides in the hot oil, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in remaining flour to absorb remaining oil. Add beef broth, wine, onion, soup mix, marjoram, Worcestershire, and bay leaves. Add enough water to cover.
2. Cover and simmer on medium-low heat until tender, about 2 hours. Add carrots and potatoes. Continue to cook until vegetables are tender, about 1 hour. If gravy is too thin, uncover and continue to simmer until liquid evaporates and gravy thickens, about 20 minutes more. Remove bay leaves from gravy when serving.
