## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- ½ cup white sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 dash ground nutmeg
- 2 tablespoons melted butter
- ½ cup milk
- 1  egg, beaten
- 1 quart oil for frying

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Sift together flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a large bowl. Mix in butter until crumbly. Stir in milk and egg until smooth.
3. Knead lightly, then turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll or pat to 1/4-inch thickness. Cut with a doughnut cutter, or use two round biscuit cutters of different sizes.
4. Lay doughnuts in hot oil, a few at a time. Do not overcrowd the pan, or oil may overflow. Fry, turning once, until golden, about 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels.
