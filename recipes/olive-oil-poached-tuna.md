## Ingredients

- 2 (10 ounce) thick-cut ahi tuna steaks
- 2 cloves garlic, bruised
- 6 sprigs fresh thyme
- 1 pinch red pepper flakes, or to taste
- 2 cups olive oil, or as needed
- sea salt to taste

## Instructions

1. Let tuna rest at room temperature for 10 to 15 minutes.
2. Combine garlic, thyme, and red pepper flakes in a heavy skillet. Pour olive oil into the skillet to reach a depth of 1 inch. Heat oil over medium heat until garlic and thyme begin to sizzle, 5 to 10 minutes.
3. Place tuna steaks gently in hot oil and reduce heat to low; cook, spooning oil over the top of tuna steaks constantly until white and hot, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat and transfer tuna steaks into a baking dish; pour hot oil and herbs on top. Cool tuna and oil to room temperature.
4. Wrap the baking dish tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate tuna steaks for 24 hours; remove from oil and sprinkle sea salt on top.
