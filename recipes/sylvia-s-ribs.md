## Ingredients

- 8 pounds pork spareribs
- 3 cups ketchup
- 1 cup barbeque sauce
- 1 cup brown sugar
- 2 ½ tablespoons lemon juice
- 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
- 1 dash hot pepper sauce, or to taste
- 3 tablespoons steak sauce, (e.g. Heinz 57)
- 2 cloves garlic, minced

## Instructions

1. Place the ribs in a large stock pot with enough water to cover. Bring the water to a boil and cook over medium-high heat for 1 hour.
2. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
3. In medium saucepan, combine ketchup, barbeque sauce, brown sugar, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, hot pepper sauce, steak sauce and garlic; blend well. Cook the sauce over medium heat for approximately 20 minutes. (Please note that the above ingredients are all to taste. Use more or less of anything you like. I never make the ribs the same way twice!)
4. Cut the ribs between the bones and place in a baking pan. Pour sauce over ribs, cover and cook for 30 minutes. Remove foil and continue cooking for an additional 30 minutes.
