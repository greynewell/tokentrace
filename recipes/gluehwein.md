## Ingredients

- ¾ cup water
- ¾ cup white sugar
- 1  cinnamon stick
- 1  orange
- 10  whole cloves
- 1 (750 milliliter) bottle red wine

## Instructions

1. Combine water, sugar, and cinnamon stick in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low.
2. Cut one orange in half; squeeze orange halves over the sugar mixture to release their juice. Push 5 cloves into the outside of each orange peel; place peels into the simmering mixture. Continue to simmer over the lowest heat until thick and syrupy, 20 to 30 minutes.
3. While the mixture is simmering, slice remaining orange and set aside for serving.
4. When the mixture is finished simmering, stir in wine and heat until steaming but not simmering, 3 to 5 minutes. Discard orange peels and cinnamon stick.
5. Ladle into stoneware mugs and garnish with orange slices.
