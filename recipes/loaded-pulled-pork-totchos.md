## Ingredients

- 1 (28 ounce) package frozen bite-size potato nuggets (such as Tater Tots®)
- salt to taste
- 2 ½ cups cooked pulled pork
- 1 cup barbeque sauce
- ¼ cup sour cream
- ½ teaspoon smoked paprika
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 ½ tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 2 ½ cups milk
- 5 ounces shredded white Cheddar cheese
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 cup canned pinto beans, drained
- ½ cup chopped roasted red bell peppers
- 1 tablespoon thinly sliced green onion  (Optional)
- 1 teaspoon minced thyme  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Spread potato nuggets on a baking sheet in a single layer.
2. Bake in the preheated oven until browned and crisp, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl; season lightly with salt.
3. Mix pulled pork and barbeque sauce together in a bowl until pork is evenly coated.
4. Whisk sour cream and smoked paprika together in a small bowl.
5. Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in flour until a paste forms, 2 to 3 minutes. Whisk in milk until no lumps remain. Cook and stir until sauce thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat; whisk in Cheddar cheese until melted. Season sauce with salt and pepper.
6. Drizzle Cheddar cheese sauce over potato nuggets. Cover with pulled pork mixture and dollops of sour cream. Top with pinto beans, roasted peppers, green onion, and thyme.
