## Ingredients

- 2 (4 ounce) cod loins
- 1 pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 1  lemon
- 2 teaspoons butter
- 1  shallot, thinly sliced

## Instructions

1. Fill a large pot with water. Attach an immersion circulator to the pot. Set the temperature to 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) and the timer to 35 minutes.
