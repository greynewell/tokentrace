## Ingredients

- 3 cups flour
- 2 teaspoons garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 2  eggs
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- oil for frying
- 3  skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cubed

## Instructions

1. Mix flour, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl. Beat eggs and lemon juice together in a separate bowl.
2. Heat 2 inches of oil in a large pot over medium heat.
3. Dredge chicken pieces in flour mixture; shake off excess. Dip into beaten egg. Lift up so excess egg drips back into the bowl. Press into flour mixture again to coat.
4. Lower pieces of chicken carefully into hot oil in batches; fry until golden brown, 7 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Repeat with remaining chicken pieces.
