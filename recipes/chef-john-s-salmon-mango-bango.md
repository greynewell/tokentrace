## Ingredients

- 1  mango - peeled, seeded and diced
- 2 tablespoons lime juice
- 2 tablespoons red bell pepper and ancho chili pepper jam
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
- 2  salmon fillets, skin removed
- sea salt to taste
- 2 teaspoons vegetable oil

## Instructions

1. Stir mango, lime juice, pepper jam, and cilantro together in a bowl. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for relish flavors to combine, about 30 minutes.
2. Season salmon fillets with sea salt.
3. Heat oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat until oil begins to smoke. Place salmon, flesh-side down, in the hot skillet and cook until edges are just starting to cook through, about 2 minutes.
