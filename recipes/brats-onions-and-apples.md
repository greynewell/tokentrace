## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 4  bratwurst
- 2  apple, cored and sliced
- 1  sweet onion, sliced
- 2 (12 fluid ounce) cans or bottles beer
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook bratwurst in hot oil until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove bratwurst to a plate, reserving drippings in the skillet.
2. Stir apple and onion slices into the reserved drippings; cook and stir until the onion softens, about 6 minutes. Return bratwurst to the skillet, nestling them into the onion mixture. Pour beer over the sausages; season with salt and pepper.
3. Bring the beer to a simmer, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until the the bratwurst is no longer pink in the center, 25 to 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
