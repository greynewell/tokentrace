## Ingredients

- 4 (4 ounce) boneless, skinless chicken thighs
- ½ teaspoon light adobo seasoning
- ground black pepper to taste
- 1 cup Dijon mustard
- ¼ cup salted butter, melted
- 1 cup dry bread crumbs, or as needed
- ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- nonstick cooking spray
- 1 teaspoon minced fresh parsley, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place a rack on a rimmed baking sheet.
2. Trim any fat off of chicken thighs and season with a light coating of adobo and pepper.
3. Stir Dijon and melted butter together in a shallow bowl until you have a glossy, buttery mixture. Combine bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese in another bowl.
4. Dip chicken thighs in the Dijon mixture until evenly coated, then dredge in the bread crumb mixture. Transfer thighs to the prepared baking sheet and spray the tops with cooking spray.
5. Bake in the preheated oven without flipping until no longer pink in the centers, 30 to 35 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
6. Garnish with parsley to serve.
