## Ingredients

- 12  hard-boiled eggs, peeled
- 2 tablespoons mayonnaise
- 1 ½ tablespoons yellow mustard
- 1  dill pickle, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon prepared horseradish, or to taste
- 1 teaspoon pickle juice
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1  carrot, cut into rounds
- 12 slices canned black olives, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Slice through the top third of each egg, ensuring some of the yolk is included in the slice. Carefully remove the egg yolk from the bottom portion of the egg using a spoon and transfer to a bowl.
2. Mix egg yolks with mayonnaise, mustard, pickle, horseradish, pickle juice, salt, and pepper. Fill a piping bag or a plastic bag with the egg yolk mixture. Snip off one corner if using a plastic bag. Pipe yolk mixture into the hollowed egg whites creating the chick, ensuring there is enough filling exposed at the top to add eyes and a beak.
3. Slice small wedges out of carrot rounds to create 12 beaks. Add a beak to each chick.
4. Slice olive pieces into small squares to be used as eyes. Add 2 eyes to each chick. Place the egg tops onto each chick so it looks like the chicks are peeking out of the eggs.
