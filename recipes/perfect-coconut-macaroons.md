## Ingredients

- 1 (14 ounce) package sweetened, flaked coconut
- ⅓ cup white sugar
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- ½ teaspoon almond extract
- 1 pinch salt
- 3  egg whites, room temperature
- 8 ounces semisweet chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
3. Blend coconut, sugar, flour, vanilla extract, almond extract, and salt in a food processor until combined, about 30 seconds.
4. Beat egg whites in a bowl until soft peaks form.
5. Fold coconut mixture into egg whites until just combined.
6. Wet your hands. Roll spoonfuls of coconut mixture between palms to golf ball-size cookies; arrange on the prepared baking sheet.
7. Bake cookies in the preheated oven until coconut is slightly golden and toasted, about 15 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool, 30 minutes.
8. Line baking sheet with new piece of parchment paper.
9. Melt chocolate chips in the top of a double boiler over just-barely simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching.
