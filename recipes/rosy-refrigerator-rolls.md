## Ingredients

- 1 cup room temperature tomato juice
- ½ cup lukewarm water (100 degrees F/38 degrees C)
- ⅔ cup white sugar
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt
- 1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
- 2  eggs
- ⅔ cup melted shortening
- 1 cup mashed potatoes
- 6 cups all-purpose flour, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Combine the tomato juice, water, sugar, and salt in a large bowl, stir until the sugar and salt dissolve, and sprinkle the yeast over the mixture. Let stand for 5 minutes until the yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam.
2. Mix in the eggs, shortening, and mashed potatoes, and beat in the flour to make a soft dough. Knead for about 5 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic, and place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease the top of the dough. Cover and refrigerate the dough for at least 2 hours or overnight.
3. Line baking sheets with parchment paper, and set aside.
4. Working on a lightly floured surface, divide the dough into 4 equal pieces, and cut each into 12 small pieces. Roll the pieces into balls, place the rolls 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets, cover with a towel, and let the rolls rise in a warm place until double, about 2 hours.
5. Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
6. Bake the rolls in the preheated oven for 12 to 15 minutes, until the tops are golden brown.
