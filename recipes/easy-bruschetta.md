## Ingredients

- 1  French baguette, cut into 1/2 inch thick circles
- 8  plum tomatoes, diced
- 1 cup chopped fresh basil
- ½  red onion, minced
- freshly ground black pepper

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Combine tomato, basil, and red onion in a small mixing bowl; stir well. Season with freshly ground black pepper. Set aside.
3. Arrange bread on a baking sheet. Place in oven, and bake until well toasted, approximately 5 minutes.
