## Ingredients

- 2 large baking potatoes
- ½ pound lean bacon
- ¾ cup shredded mild Cheddar cheese
- ½ cup sour cream
- ¼ cup milk
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
- 1 teaspoon dried chives
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ¾ cup shredded mild Cheddar cheese

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch casserole dish.
2. Use a toothpick to poke a few holes into each potato.
3. Bake potatoes in the preheated oven until fully cooked, about 1 hour. Cool for about 15 minutes.
4. Cook bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate; crumble and set aside.
5. Cut a thin slice from one side of each baked potato; carefully scoop out flesh and transfer to a large bowl. Discard skins.
6. Mix 1/2 of the Cheddar cheese, sour cream, milk, butter, chives, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper into potatoes until well combined. Spread potato mixture into the prepared casserole dish; top with remaining Cheddar cheese and crumbled bacon.
7. Bake in the preheated oven until just bubbling, 10 to 15 minutes. Cool for at least 5 minutes before serving.
