## Ingredients

- 1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast meat - cubed
- 2  onions, diced
- 1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
- 1  yellow bell pepper, seeded and sliced into strips
- 1  red bell pepper, seeded and sliced into strips
- 4 cloves garlic, sliced
- 4 small potatoes, cubed
- ¼ cup olive oil
- 1  lemon, juiced

## Instructions

1. Build a campfire and allow the fire to burn until it has accumulated a bed of coals. Rake the coals into a flat bed on one side of the fire.
2. Combine chicken, onion, mushrooms, peppers, garlic, and potatoes in a large bowl or a large resealable plastic bag. Pour in olive oil and lemon juice and toss to coat.
3. Evenly divide the mixture between 4 large sheets of aluminum foil. Top each with another sheet of foil and roll up the edges tightly. Double wrap each packet with another sheet of foil.
4. Cook over the preheated coals until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
