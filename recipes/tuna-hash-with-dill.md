## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons vegetable or olive oil
- 1 large onion, cut into 1/2-inch dice
- 3 (5 ounce) cans tuna, drained
- 1 ½ pounds starchy potatoes (such as Idaho), cut into 1/2-inch dice
- 2 tablespoons vegetable or olive oil
- 2 tablespoons ketchup
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill
- 2 tablespoons water
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper

## Instructions

1. Heat 2 Tbs. oil over low heat in a 12-inch non-stick skillet (so potatoes don't stick).
2. While skillet heats, prepare onion and tuna as directed above.
3. A few minutes before cooking, increase heat to medium-high.
4. When oil starts to send up wisps of smoke, add onion and tuna; cook, stirring often, until golden brown.
5. Meanwhile, dice potatoes and toss with remaining oil.
6. Transfer tuna mixture to a bowl and reserve.
7. Add potatoes to empty skillet; cook, stirring only occasionally so they form a golden-brown crust, about 10 minutes.
8. As potatoes cook, mix ketchup, mustard, fresh dill and 2 Tbs. of water. (Recipe can be prepared to this point up to 2 hours ahead.
9. Spread hot potatoes on a large lipped cookie sheet; cover when cool.
10. Return skillet to medium-high; add potatoes and re-crisp.) Return reserved tuna mixture to skillet; stir in ketchup mixture, then season with salt and pepper.
11. Cook, stirring frequently, until hash has nicely browned, about 5 minutes longer.
