## Ingredients

- 1 (16 ounce) package whole wheat elbow macaroni
- ½ cup dried minced onion
- 1 pound cooked and cubed lobster meat
- 1 pound cooked shrimp, tails removed
- 1 (12 ounce) can evaporated milk
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, sifted
- 3  eggs
- 1 stick butter
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 pound shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
- 1 pound shredded Swiss cheese
- 1 pound shredded Monterey Jack cheese
- 1 stick butter
- 1 tablespoon dried onion seasoning (such as Pampered Chef® Three Onion Rub)
- 1 teaspoon herbes de Provence
- 2 cups crushed buttery round crackers (such as Ritz®)
- 1 stick butter, sliced into pats

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni and 1/2 cup dried onion in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until macaroni is tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.
2. Place lobster and shrimp in a colander. Pour cooked pasta and onions over shellfish; let drain.
3. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
4. Whisk eggs together in a medium bowl; set aside. Warm evaporated milk and cream slowly in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk in flour; cook sauce until small bubbles form. Add sauce very slowly, 1/4 cup at a time, to the bowl with eggs, being careful not to cook and scramble the eggs. Slowly mix egg-cream mixture back into the pan. Continue cooking on medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until thick and smooth, 5 to 10 minutes.
5. Melt 1 stick of butter in the pot used to cook the pasta over medium heat. Add flour; cook until roux thickens and turns caramel in color, about 5 minutes. Stir in Cheddar cheese, Swiss cheese, and Monterey Jack cheese. Cook, stirring constantly, until mostly melted, about 4 minutes. Pour in cream sauce and stir until smooth.
6. Stir pasta, lobster, and shrimp into cheese and cream sauce to coat completely; transfer into a 9x11-inch baking dish.
7. Melt another stick of butter in the saucepan used to make the sauce. Add onion seasoning and herbes de Provence; stir. Add crackers; cook and stir over medium heat until coating mixture is lightly toasted, about 5 minutes.
8. Cover macaroni mixture with thin pats of butter. Top with cracker coating.
9. Bake in the preheated oven until top is crispy and cheeses are melted, about 1 hour.
