## Ingredients

- 1 cup vegetable oil
- ½ cup soy sauce
- ½ cup light corn syrup
- ¼ cup lemon juice
- 2 tablespoons sesame seeds
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- garlic salt to taste
- 4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into 1 1/2 inch pieces
- 1 (8 ounce) package fresh chopped mushrooms
- 2  onions, quartered
- 1  green bell pepper, cut into large chunks

## Instructions

1. Whisk together vegetable oil, soy sauce, light corn syrup, lemon juice, sesame seeds, garlic powder, and garlic salt in a medium bowl. Add chicken; stir to coat. Cover the bowl and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.
2. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
3. Thread chicken onto skewers alternately with onions, mushrooms, and bell pepper. Pour marinade into a small saucepan; bring to a boil. Cook until slightly thickened, 5 to 10 minutes.
