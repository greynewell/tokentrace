## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 1 teaspoon grated orange zest
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- ¼ cup milk
- ¼ cup vanilla yogurt
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 4  eggs
- ½ cup orange juice
- 1  egg
- 3 tablespoons white sugar
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
- 1 (16 ounce) package small curd cottage cheese
- 5 tablespoons dry bread crumbs
- 1 tablespoon grated orange zest
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter

## Instructions

1. Mix 2 tablespoons of sugar, 1 teaspoon of orange zest, salt, and flour in a small bowl. Combine milk and yogurt in a separate bowl. Stir in olive oil and mix until smooth. Beat 4 eggs in a large bowl, then add orange juice. Stir in the yogurt mixture followed by the flour mixture. Beat until smooth. Allow batter to rest at room temperature for 1 hour.
2. Beat 1 egg with 3 tablespoons of sugar, then add butter and cottage cheese, mixing until smooth. Stir in the bread crumbs and 1 tablespoon of orange zest. Refrigerate until the batter is ready.
3. Lightly butter a 6 inch skillet, and heat over medium heat. For each crepe, pour 1/4 cup of the batter into the skillet, and immediately rotate the skillet until the batter evenly coats the bottom in a thin layer. Cook until the top of the crepe is no longer wet and the bottom has turned light brown. Run a spatula around the edge of the skillet to loosen; flip the crepe, and cook until the other side has turned light brown. Stack the crepes in a clean kitchen towel, placing waxed paper between each.
4. Place 2 to 3 tablespoons of the filling onto the golden side of the crepe. Roll the crepe up and repeat until all the blintzes are made. Heat 2 tablespoons of butter in a large skillet and fry 4 to 5 blintzes at a time until golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side.
