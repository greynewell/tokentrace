## Ingredients

- 2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
- 2 ½ cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
- 1 (9 ounce) package yellow cake mix
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 5 cups all-purpose flour
- ½ cup butter, softened
- ¾ cup white sugar
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 3 cups confectioners' sugar
- ⅓ cup butter, softened
- 1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 ½ tablespoons milk

## Instructions

1. In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.
2. In a large bowl, combine the yeast mixture with the cake mix, salt and vanilla; stir well to combine. Stir in the flour; beat well. Cover bowl and let rise in a warm place for 1 hour.
3. Deflate dough and turn it out onto a well floured surface. Roll dough out into a rectangle and spread with butter. Sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar. Roll up dough and cut into 3/4 inch thick rolls. Place rolls in two lightly greased 9x13 inch baking pans. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes.
4. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
5. Bake rolls in preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes. While rolls are baking, prepare the frosting. In a medium bowl, stir together confectioners' sugar, 1/3 cup butter, vanilla and milk. Let rolls cool slightly then spread with frosting.
