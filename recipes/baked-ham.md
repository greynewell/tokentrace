## Ingredients

- 1 (12 pound)  bone-in ham, rump portion
- ½ cup whole cloves
- 1 cup packed brown sugar
- 4 cups water, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Place ham in a large roasting pan; press cloves into the top at 1- to 2-inch intervals. Pack the top with a layer of brown sugar. Pour enough water into the bottom of the roasting pan to come to a 1-inch depth; cover the pan tightly with aluminum foil.
3. Bake in the preheated oven for 4 1/2 to 5 hours, or until the internal temperature of the ham has reached 160 degrees F (72 degrees C), making sure the meat thermometer is not touching the bone. Let stand for about 20 minutes before carving.
