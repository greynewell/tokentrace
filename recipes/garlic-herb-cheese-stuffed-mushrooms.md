## Ingredients

- 1 (5.2 ounce) package garlic and herb cheese spread (such as Boursin®)
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- 1 (8 ounce) package grated Parmesan cheese, divided
- 1 cup olive oil
- 20  mushrooms, stems removed

## Instructions

1. Preheat an oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Combine the cheese spread, cream cheese, and 1/2 package of Parmesan cheese in a bowl until well blended; cover and refrigerate.
2. Place the olive oil in a bowl. Dip each mushroom in the oil, covering entirely. Place the mushroom face down on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Cover mushrooms with another sheet of parchment paper.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until tender, about 12 minutes. Remove from oven and allow mushroom to cool slightly. Line the baking sheet with a clean sheet of parchment paper. Over-stuff each mushroom cap with the prepared cheese mixture and arrange on the baking sheet.
4. Return the baking sheet to the oven, and continue baking until the cheese is melted, about 12 minutes more. Sprinkle with the remaining 1/2 package Parmesan cheese before serving.
