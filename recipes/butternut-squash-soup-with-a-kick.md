## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1  onion, diced
- 2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger
- 1  jalapeno pepper, seeded and diced
- 1 (2 pound) butternut squash - peeled, seeded, and cubed
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth
- 1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk
- ½ cup coconut milk
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- salt and black pepper to taste
- 1 cup sour cream
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in onion, ginger, and jalapeño pepper; cook and stir until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 7 minutes.
2. Add butternut squash and chicken broth; bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until squash is tender, about 30 minutes.
3. Stir in evaporated milk, coconut milk, sugar, salt, and pepper. Cook and stir 5 minutes more.
4. Pour soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel; carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get soup moving before leaving it on to purée. Purée in batches until smooth and pour into a clean pot. (Alternately, you can use a stick blender and purée soup in the cooking pot.) Ladle soup into bowls and garnish with sour cream and thyme to serve.
