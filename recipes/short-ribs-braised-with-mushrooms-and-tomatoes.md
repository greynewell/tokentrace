## Ingredients

- ½ cup dried porcini mushrooms
- ½ cup water
- 2 ½ pounds beef short ribs
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1  onion, sliced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 cups beef broth
- 1 cup tomato sauce
- 1 teaspoon dried rosemary
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper
