## Ingredients

- 1 pound bacon slices
- 1 pound ground chicken
- 1 tablespoon barbeque chicken seasoning
- 3 slices Havarti cheese

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Measure out a 20-inch square piece of parchment paper on a baking sheet.
3. Lay out slices of bacon side-by-side, overlapping slightly, to create an even layer on the parchment paper.
4. Combine ground chicken with barbeque seasoning; spread evenly onto the bacon layer from edge to edge.
5. Place Havarti cheese slices lengthwise on top.
6. Lift the parchment paper to help you roll a log, starting with the edge of bacon closest to you.
7. Bake in the preheated oven, rotating baking sheet every 15 minutes, until bacon is crispy and chicken is cooked through; an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 1 hour.
8. Remove from oven and cool until easily handled, about 15 minutes.
9. Slice into bite-sized "sushi".
