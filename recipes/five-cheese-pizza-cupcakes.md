## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil, or more as needed
- 1 (13.8 ounce) can refrigerated pizza dough (such as Pillsbury®)
- 1 teaspoon garlic salt
- 1 cup tomato sauce
- 1 cup sliced pepperoni
- 1 cup chopped bell pepper
- ½ cup chopped red onion
- 1 cup shredded 4-cheese Mexican blend cheese
- 1 cup diced salami
- 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
- ¼ cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Use the oil to lightly grease the cups of two 12-cup muffin tins.
2. Take pizza dough and put enough in each cup to cover the bottom and 1/3 to 1/2 up the sides. Sprinkle garlic salt over top, then spoon 1 tablespoon sauce onto each crust.
3. Layer toppings on the sauce: pepperoni, bell pepper, and onion. Add about 1 tablespoon Mexican cheese to each and continue layering toppings: salami, more bell pepper, and more pepperoni. Add a layer of mozzarella cheese and Cheddar cheese. Continue layering toppings until muffin cups are slightly overfull; the toppings should not overflow during cooking, they will settle into the tin.
4. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool in the tins for 2 minutes before serving.
