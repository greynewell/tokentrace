## Ingredients

- 1 cup warm water
- 2 ½ teaspoons active dry yeast
- 2 tablespoons sugar, or more to taste
- 3 tablespoons milk
- 1  egg, beaten
- 2 teaspoons salt, or to taste
- 5 ½ cups bread flour, or as needed
- 2 cloves garlic, minced  (Optional)
- ¼ cup butter, melted

## Instructions

1. Combine water, yeast, and sugar in a large bowl. Let stand until bubbly and frothy, about 10 minutes.
2. Stir in milk, egg, salt, and enough flour to make a soft dough. Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth, 6 to 8 minutes. Place dough into a well oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and set aside to rise until the dough has doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
3. Punch down dough and knead well. For garlic naan, knead in garlic at this point.
4. Pinch off small handfuls of dough about the size of golf balls. Roll into balls, cover with a clean cloth, and allow to rise until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.
5. Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
6. Roll out 2 balls of dough into elongated ovals. Place on an ungreased baking sheet and cook under the broiler until lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Brush butter on both sides and flip. Continue broiling until the second side is firm and golden, 2 minutes more. Repeat with remaining dough.
