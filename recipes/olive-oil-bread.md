## Ingredients

- ½ cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
- 2 ¼ teaspoons active dry yeast
- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 4 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour

## Instructions

1. In a large bowl mix together the warm water (110 degrees), yeast, sugar, salt, and olive oil. Stir in 2 cups of the flour in order to make a soft ball.
