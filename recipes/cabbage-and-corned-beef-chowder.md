## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons butter
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1  onion, chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, chopped
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon dill seed
- ½ teaspoon tarragon leaves
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 4 cups chicken broth
- 3 cups chopped cabbage
- 2 cups finely chopped deli corned beef
- 2 cups half-and-half
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese

## Instructions

1. Melt butter and olive oil together in a stockpot over medium heat; saute onion and garlic until onion is slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Add flour, dill seed, tarragon leaves, and black pepper to onion mixture; cook and stir until flour is dissolved and fragrant, about 3 minutes.

3. Stir half-and-half into the pot; continue to cook just until liquid is warm but not boiling, about 5 minutes.
4. Melt cream cheese over low heat in a saucepan until creamy, 2 to 3 minutes. Whisk cornstarch and water together in a bowl; stir into cream cheese until smooth. Stir cream cheese mixture into soup; cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until cheese melts and soup is thickened, about 5 minutes.
