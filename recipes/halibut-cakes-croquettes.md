## Ingredients

- ¼ cup vegetable oil, divided
- 1 pound skinless, boneless halibut fillets
- 1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 cup shredded Italian cheese blend
- 1  egg
- ¼ cup mayonnaise
- ¼ cup minced onion
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 2 tablespoons panko bread crumbs
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon dry mustard
- 1 teaspoon seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®)

## Instructions

1. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add halibut fillets; season with salt and pepper. Cook until flesh flakes easily with a fork, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate; cool until easily handled, about 5 minutes. Flake into small chunks.
