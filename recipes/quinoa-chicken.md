## Ingredients

- 2 cups chicken broth
- 1 cup quinoa
- 2 teaspoons vegetable oil, or as needed
- ½  onion, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, or to taste, minced
- 1 ½ pounds ground chicken
- 1 ½ (10 ounce) cans diced tomatoes with green chile peppers (such as RO*TEL®)

## Instructions

1. Bring chicken broth and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Sauté onion and garlic in hot oil until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add ground chicken; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.
3. Stir cooked quinoa and diced tomatoes into chicken mixture; bring to a simmer and cook long enough for flavors to meld, about 10 minutes more.
