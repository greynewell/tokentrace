## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 4  pork chops
- 1 large apple - peeled, cored, and thinly sliced
- 1 tablespoon butter
- ½ cup apple juice
- ½ cup heavy cream
- 1 teaspoon cornstarch

## Instructions

1. Combine oil, thyme, salt, and pepper in a large, shallow dish. Add pork chops to the dish, brush with oil mixture, and set aside for 15 minutes.
2. Heat a large skillet over medium heat and cook pork chops until browned on one side, 4 to 5 minutes. Turn and cook until lightly browned on the other side and juices run clear, 4 to 5 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a chop should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Transfer pork chops to a serving plate, cover, and keep warm.
3. Reduce heat and add butter to the same skillet. Cook and stir apple slices in melted butter until slightly softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer apples to the serving plate with pork chops, cover, and keep warm.
4. Stir together apple juice, cream, and cornstarch in a small bowl. Add to the skillet over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food from the bottom of the pan. Cook and stir until sauce starts to thicken, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour sauce over pork chops and apples to serve.
