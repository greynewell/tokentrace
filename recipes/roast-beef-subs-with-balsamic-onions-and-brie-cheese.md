## Ingredients

- 1 pound top round beef, cut into 1-inch pieces
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- 2 teaspoons Montreal steak seasoning
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 small sweet onions, sliced
- ⅓ cup balsamic vinegar
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon cracked black pepper
- 1 teaspoon canola oil
- 4 (6 inch) submarine sandwich roll, split
- 6 ounces Brie cheese, torn into pieces

## Instructions

1. Stir beef, Worcestershire sauce, and Montreal steak seasoning together in a bowl.
2. Marinate beef while preparing other items.
3. Heat olive oil in skillet over high heat.
4. Cook and stir onions in hot oil until golden brown, about 15 minutes; add balsamic vinegar, salt, and black pepper.
5. Reduce heat to low and cook the onion mixture at a simmer until there is little liquid remaining and the mixture is syrup-like in texture, about 10 minutes.
6. Preheat an outdoor grill to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) and lightly oil the grate.
7. Remove steak pieces from the marinade and shake off excess.
8. Discard the remaining marinade.
9. Combine beef and canola oil in a bowl and toss to coat.
10. Preheat oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).
11. Cook the beef slices on the hot grill, turning frequently, until they start to firm and are reddish-pink and juicy in the center, 4 to 6 minutes per side.
12. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C).
13. Arrange rolls onto a baking sheet.
14. Spoon onions into the bottom of the sandwich rolls; add beef.
15. Top beef with Brie cheese.
16. Heat in preheated oven until the cheese melts, about 5 minutes.
