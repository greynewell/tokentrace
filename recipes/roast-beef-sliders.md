## Ingredients

- 1  serving cooking spray
- 1 pound thinly sliced deli roast beef
- 1 (8 ounce) package thinly sliced provolone cheese
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1 small onion, diced
- 1  green bell pepper, diced
- ½ cup sliced mushrooms
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
- ¼ teaspoon garlic powder
- ¼ teaspoon adobo seasoning
- ¼ teaspoon Italian seasoning
- 12  slider buns

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
2. Slice the rolls in half vertically, leaving each roll attached as a sheet. Peel off the top layer and set aside; place the bottoms of the rolls in the prepared dish. Layer roast beef and cheese across the rolls.
3. Heat oil in a a small skillet over medium-high heat. Cook onion, bell pepper, and mushrooms until soft, about 5 minutes. Spread pepper mixture over cheese and beef. Place the tops of the rolls back on.
4. Mix melted butter, garlic powder, adobo seasoning, and Italian seasoning together. Brush seasoned butter on the tops of the rolls, pouring any extra over the sides.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese starts to melt, about 15 minutes. Separate each roll into a sandwich using a serrated knife. Serve hot.
