## Ingredients

- 1 (16 ounce) package bow tie pasta
- ¾ stick butter
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- salt and pepper to taste
- 1  yellow onion, chopped
- 1 tablespoon crushed red pepper flakes, divided
- 1 pound crawfish tails
- 2 pints heavy cream
- ½ tablespoon crushed red pepper flakes
- 1 bunch green onions, chopped

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes; drain.
2. While pasta cooks, melt butter in a large, deep skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir garlic in butter, 1 to 2 minutes; season with salt and pepper. Stir in onion and 1/2 tablespoon red pepper flakes; cook until onion becomes translucent. Add crawfish tails; cook, stirring continually, 2 to 3 minutes; transfer crawfish to a bowl, leaving as many onions as possible in the skillet.
3. Pour heavy cream into the skillet and bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer until thickened. Sprinkle remaining 1/2 tablespoon red pepper flakes into cream, return crawfish to the sauce, and simmer 2 to 3 minutes.
4. Serve sauce over drained pasta; garnish with chopped green onion.
