## Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon apple pie spice
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 1 (12 ounce) can refrigerated biscuit dough, separated and cut into six pieces
- ½ cup brown sugar
- 3 tablespoons butter
- 1 teaspoon water

## Instructions

1. Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Butter 6 muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners.
2. Combine the apple pie spice and white sugar in a small bowl; roll the biscuit pieces in the mixture to coat. Divide the coated pieces between the prepared muffin cups.
3. Combine the brown sugar, butter, and water in a small saucepan over medium heat; bring to a boil, stirring continuously. Allow the mixture to boil until the sugar is completely dissolved, 2 to 3 minutes. Spoon the mixture over the biscuit pieces.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until golden, and the tops spring back when lightly pressed, 8 to 12 minutes.
