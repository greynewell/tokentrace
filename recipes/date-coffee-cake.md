## Ingredients

- 1 (8 ounce) package dried pitted dates, diced
- 2 teaspoons baking soda, divided
- ⅓ cup boiling water
- 3 cups whole wheat flour
- 2 teaspoons instant coffee
- 2 teaspoons milk powder
- 2 tablespoons boiling water
- 1 ¾ cups white sugar
- 1 cup margarine
- 1 ½ tablespoons margarine
- 4 large eggs

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan.
2. Place dates in a bowl. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon baking soda on top and mix well. Add 1/3 cup boiling water, stir, and set aside until dates have swelled, about 10 minutes. Squeeze with your hands to remove most of the liquid.
3. Meanwhile, mix flour and 1 teaspoon baking soda together in a bowl. Combine instant coffee, milk powder, and 2 tablespoons boiling water in a separate bowl; mix until dissolved.
4. Beat sugar, margarine, and eggs together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until well blended. Add coffee mixture and dates; beat until well mixed. Gradually mix in flour. Pour batter into the prepared baking pan.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes.
