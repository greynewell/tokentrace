## Ingredients

- 1 large egg
- 2 ounces cream cheese, softened
- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
- ¼ cup white sugar
- ¼ cup brown sugar
- ½ (3.5 ounce) package vanilla pudding mix
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
- 1 cup cake flour
- 1 tablespoon cake flour
- ¾ tablespoon cornstarch
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- 1 pinch salt
- 2 tablespoons miniature semisweet chocolate chips
- 2 tablespoons white chocolate chips, chopped
- 2 tablespoons miniature marshmallows
- 2 tablespoons crushed chocolate sandwich cookies (such as Oreo®)

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a cookie pan with parchment paper.
2. Whisk egg in a bowl. Discard half of the mixture or reserve for another use.
3. Beat cream cheese in a stand mixer until smooth, about 3 minutes. Add butter and beat until combined, about 1 minute. Add white and brown sugars; beat until creamy, about 3 minutes, scraping down the sides as needed. Mix in pudding mix. Add the remaining beaten egg and vanilla extract; mix until combined.
4. Whisk 1 cup plus 1 tablespoon flour, 1 cup plus 1 tablespoon cake flour, cornstarch, baking soda, and salt together in a medium bowl. Gradually add dry ingredients to wet ingredients, mixing on low speed and scraping down the sides as needed, until just combined. Add chocolate chips, white chocolate chips, marshmallows, and crushed cookies; fold in with a spatula or mix on low speed with the stand mixer.
5. Roughly shape heaping tablespoonfuls of batter into balls and evenly space them on the prepared pan.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until the bottoms are golden brown, about 15 minutes.
7. Cool on the baking sheet briefly before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
