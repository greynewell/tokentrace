## Ingredients

- 4 quarts mussels, cleaned and debearded
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1  onion, chopped
- 6 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
- 1  bay leaf
- ¼ teaspoon dried thyme
- 2 cups white wine
- 3 tablespoons butter, divided

## Instructions

1. Scrub mussels. Pull off beards, the tuft of fibers that attach each mussel to it's shell, cutting them at the base with a paring knife. Discard those that do not close when you handle them and any with broken shells. Set aside.
2. Combine onion, garlic, 4 tablespoons parsley, bay leaf, thyme, wine, and 2 tablespoons butter in large pot. Bring to boil. Lower heat, and cook 2 minutes. Add mussels, and cover. Cook just until shells open, 3 to 4 minutes. Do not overcook. Remove mussels from sauce, and place in bowls.
3. Strain liquid, and return to pot. Add remaining butter and parsley. Heat until butter melts. Pour over mussels.
