## Ingredients

- 1 (16 ounce) package farfalle (bow tie) pasta
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 small onions, chopped
- 1 (4 ounce) can mushroom pieces and stems, drained
- ¼ cup butter
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- 2 ½ cups milk
- 1 ½ teaspoons crushed garlic
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook farfalle at a boil, stirring occasionally, until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain and transfer farfalle back to the pot.
2. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook chicken in hot oil until no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, 5 to 8 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a cutting board and slice into thin strips.
3. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in the same skillet; cook and stir onions in melted butter until transparent, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir mushrooms and chicken strips into onions; cook and stir until heated through, about 5 minutes. Remove the skillet from heat.
4. Melt 1/4 cup butter in another large skillet; stir flour into melted butter until dissolved, about 1 minute. Slowly whisk milk into flour mixture until smooth; add garlic, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil for 1 minute; reduce heat.
5. Stir chicken mixture and farfalle into garlic sauce; cook and stir over medium-low heat until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes.
