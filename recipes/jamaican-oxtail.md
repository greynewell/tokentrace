## Ingredients

- 2 ½ pounds oxtail
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 1 tablespoon garlic and herb seasoning (such as Spike®)
- 1 teaspoon browning sauce (such as Grace®)
- ¼ teaspoon ground paprika
- ¼ teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 2  carrots, thinly sliced
- 2 stalks celery, thinly sliced
- 1  onion, chopped
- 4  garlic cloves, minced
- 3 cups low-sodium beef broth
- 1 bunch fresh thyme
- 1 sprig fresh rosemary
- 1  bay leaf
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter

## Instructions

1. Place oxtail in a shallow dish. Combine soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, salt, sugar, garlic and herb seasoning, browning sauce, paprika, cayenne pepper, and black pepper together in a small bowl. Rub both sides of oxtail with soy sauce mixture; discard any excess.
2. Heat vegetable oil in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. Sear oxtail in hot oil until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side; transfer to a plate and set aside.
3. Sauté carrots, celery, onion, and garlic in the same skillet until softened, about 5 minutes. Add beef broth, thyme, rosemary, and bay leaf; bring to a boil. Add oxtail, with its juices, and butter. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until oxtail is fork tender, about 3 hours.
4. Uncover skillet and increase heat to high. Cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce reduces and thickens, about 5 minutes.
