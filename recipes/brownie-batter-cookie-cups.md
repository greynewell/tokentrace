## Ingredients

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 (6 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- ½ cup butter, softened
- ½ cup milk chocolate chips
- 2 tablespoons butter
- ⅓ cup white sugar
- 1  egg, beaten
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
2. Mix flour and sugar together in a large bowl. Set aside.
3. Beat cream cheese and butter together using an electric mixer in a mixing bowl until combined. Stir into flour mixture until just combined. Press pastry dough evenly into the bottom and up the sides of each cup of an ungreased 24-cup mini muffin pan.
4. Heat milk chocolate chips and butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat until melted and chocolate is only slightly lumpy, 2 to 3 minutes. Cool slightly and stir in sugar, egg, and vanilla extract.
5. Spoon roughly 1 teaspoon batter into each pastry-lined muffin cup.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until pastry is golden and filling is slightly puffed, about 20 minutes. Let cool in pan 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
