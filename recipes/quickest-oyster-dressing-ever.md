## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons butter
- ½ cup chopped celery
- ¼ teaspoon dried sage
- ¼ teaspoon poultry seasoning
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth
- ⅔ cup water
- ¼ cup margarine
- 1 (6 ounce) package dry cornbread stuffing mix
- 2 (8 ounce) cans oysters, drained and liquid reserved
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper

## Instructions

1. Melt butter in a small skillet over medium heat, and cook and stir the celery until tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in sage and poultry seasoning. Remove from heat.
2. Mix chicken broth with water in a large saucepan, and bring to a simmer over medium heat; stir in the margarine until melted. Lightly stir the cornbread stuffing mix into the broth mixture until the broth has absorbed; fluff the stuffing mix with a fork.
