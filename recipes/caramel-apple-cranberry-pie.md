## Ingredients

- 1  pastry for a 9-inch double crust pie
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 4  Granny Smith apples
- ½ cup butter
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch
- 2 tablespoons water
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- ½ cup white sugar  (Optional)
- ½ cup brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon  (Optional)
- ½ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1 cup dried cranberries
- 1 tablespoon white sugar  (Optional)
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Press one of the pie pastries into a 9-inch pie plate; reserve the remaining pastry.
2. Pour the lemon juice into a container that large enough for the apples and fill halfway with cold water. Peel and slice the apples into the lemon water; set aside.
3. Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the flour and cornstarch to form a paste. Stir in 2 tablespoons of water along with the vanilla extract, 1/2 cup white sugar, brown sugar, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, and nutmeg; bring to a simmer. Drain the apples and add them to the sugar mixture along with the cranberries. Cook and stir 5 minutes; remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly.
4. Pour the fruit into the pie plate and press on the top crust. Stir together 1 tablespoon of white sugar and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon; sprinkle over the pie.
5. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes; reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue baking until the top crust is golden brown, 35 to 40 minutes.
