## Ingredients

- 1  skinless, boneless chicken breast
- 1 (8 ounce) jar spicy salsa
- cooking spray
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Place the chicken breast, smooth-side up, on a work surface. Holding it down with one palm, slice breast horizontally, stopping 3/4 of the way through. Open like a book. Spread some salsa on one half, then close. Coat with cooking spray and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Transfer to a baking dish and top with more salsa.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
