## Ingredients

- 1 cup half-and-half cream
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ¼ cup chopped fresh strawberries
- 4 cups ice cubes
- ¼ cup kosher salt

## Instructions

1. Combine the half and half, sugar, vanilla, and strawberries in a quart size resealable plastic bag. Press the air out of the bag, seal, and shake bag to combine contents. Place the bag into a gallon sized zip top bag. Add the ice to the gallon bag, press the air out, and seal bag.
2. Wrap bags in a hand towel. Shake continuously, until the contents of the small bag thickens into soft-serve ice cream, 5 to 10 minutes.
3. Rinse the small bag quickly under cold water to wash off salt. Lay the ice cream filled baggie on a flat surface. Use a wooden spoon handle to push the ice cream down to the bottom corner of the baggie. Snip off the corner, and squeeze ice cream into a bowl.
