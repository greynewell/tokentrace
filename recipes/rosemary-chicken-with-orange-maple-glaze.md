## Ingredients

- 1 cup orange juice
- ½ cup dry white wine
- ½ cup maple syrup
- 2 teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons olive oil

## Instructions

1. Bring orange juice and wine to a boil in a small saucepan. Reduce heat slightly, but keep high enough to continue a low boil for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in maple syrup and continue boiling for another 5 to 6 minutes, stirring frequently, until glossy and just slightly thickened. Set aside.
2. In a small bowl mix together the rosemary, salt and pepper. Rub mixture on both sides of chicken breasts, and set aside.
3. Melt butter and olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add chicken breasts, cover skillet and saute for about 5 minutes on each side until lightly browned. Pour orange-maple mixture over chicken (mixture will boil and bubble). Reduce heat to simmer; cover and let cook for another 10 minutes, basting occasionally, until chicken is cooked through and sauce has turned into a rich, thick glaze.
