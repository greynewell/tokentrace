## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1  onion, diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 cup uncooked quinoa
- 2 cups vegetable broth
- ¾ pound salmon fillets
- 1 cup white wine
- ½ cup water, or more as needed to cover

## Instructions

1. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and 2 cloves garlic until fragrant, about 2 minutes.
