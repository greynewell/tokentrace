## Ingredients

- 1 (1 1/4 pound) flank steak, cut into 8 pieces
- 2 tablespoons avocado oil
- 1 (8 ounce) package cremini mushrooms, roughly chopped
- 1  onion, finely chopped
- 2 large cloves garlic, grated
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- ¼ cup dry red wine
- 1 ½ cups beef broth
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- ¾ teaspoon salt, or to taste
- freshly ground black pepper to taste
- ¼ cup water
- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour

## Instructions

1. Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot) and select Sauté function. Working in batches, sauté steak until browned but not cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate.
2. Heat avocado oil in the pot. Add mushrooms and onion; sauté until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and thyme; sauté until fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour in wine; cook and stir until almost evaporated, about 2 minutes.
3. Add broth, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper; bring to a simmer. Add steak and turn to coat until coated with the broth mixture. Select the Meat option according to manufacturer's instructions. Close and lock the lid; set timer for 20 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
4. Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, at least 20 minutes. Transfer the steak to a plate.
5. Stir water and flour together in a small bowl to make a slurry. Select the Sauté option and slowly add the slurry to the broth mixture in the pot. Cook until liquid thickens, 3 to 5 minutes.
6. Pull steak apart into shreds using 2 forks. Return shredded steak to the pot and mix with the liquid.
