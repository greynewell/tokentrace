## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 8  eggs, at room temperature
- 1 ¼ cups white sugar
- 1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour, sifted
- 2 ½ cups chilled heavy whipping cream
- ½ cup confectioners' sugar, or to taste
- 1 cup fresh strawberries, sliced

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 9-inch round cake pans with cooking spray.
2. Beat eggs with an electric mixer on medium speed until pale and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add white sugar gradually, continuing to beat on medium speed until fully incorporated, about 6 minutes. Add flour slowly, using a spatula. Beat the batter for 1 minute on low speed.
3. Divide batter between the prepared cake pans.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes in the pans. Invert onto a wire rack to cool completely, about 25 minutes.
5. While cakes are cooling, beat heavy cream with clean beaters until soft peaks form. Add confectioners' sugar slowly, continue to beat until stiff peaks form.
6. Lay strawberries evenly over 1 cooled cake layer. Spread enough whipped cream over the strawberries to cover them completely. Lay second cake layer on top. Frost with remaining whipped cream.
