## Ingredients

- 1 ¼ cups multigrain flour
- 1 cup whole wheat flour
- ¼ cup sunflower seeds
- ¼ cup flax seeds
- ¼ cup wheat germ
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ cup cold butter
- 1 cup milk
- 1  egg, lightly beaten
- ¼ cup sesame seeds

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Whisk multi-grain flour, wheat flour, sunflower seeds, flax seeds, wheat germ, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl.
3. Grate cold butter into flour mixture using the largest holes of a cheese grater and mix with a fork until it resembles coarse crumbs. Slowly pour in milk and mix until dough begins to pull away from sides of the bowl.
4. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead to form a soft dough, about 10 turns. Pat into an 8-inch square, cut into quarters, and cut each quarter into 3 rectangular pieces.
5. Place each piece of dough onto an ungreased baking sheet, about 1 inch apart; brush with egg and sprinkle with sesame seeds.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until golden, 12 to 15 minutes.
