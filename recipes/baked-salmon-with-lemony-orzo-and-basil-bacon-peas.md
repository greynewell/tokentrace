## Ingredients

- 1 cup orzo
- 2 teaspoons garlic powder
- 5 large basil leaves, thinly sliced, divided
- 2 teaspoons sea salt, divided
- 1 (1 1/2 pound) skin-on, sockeye salmon
- ¼ cup butter, melted, divided
- 3 slices bacon, chopped
- 1 (16 ounce) package frozen peas
- freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 2  lemons, juiced, divided

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking pan with aluminum foil or parchment paper.
2. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook orzo in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes. Drain.
3. Mix garlic powder, 4 leaves basil, and 1/2 teaspoon salt together in a small bowl.
4. Place salmon skin side-down on the prepared pan. Brush with 1 tablespoon butter; sprinkle garlic-basil mixture on top.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until salmon flakes easily with a fork, about 8 minutes. Remove and let rest.
6. Place bacon in a skillet over medium-low heat and cook, stirring often, until crispy, about 4 minutes. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt and peas. Season with pepper. Cook and stir until peas are heated through, 3 to 4 minutes.
7. Whisk remaining 3 tablespoons butter, juice from 1 lemon, and remaining 1 teaspoon salt together in a bowl. Pour over the cooked orzo and toss to coat. Season with pepper.
8. Divide orzo among 4 plates; top with salmon and place peas on the side. Garnish with the remaining basil. Drizzle remaining lemon juice on top.
