## Ingredients

- 6  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into 1/2 inch strips
- 1  egg, beaten
- 1 cup buttermilk
- 1 ½ teaspoons garlic powder
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 cup seasoned bread crumbs
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 quart oil for frying

## Instructions

1. Place chicken strips into a large, resealable plastic bag. Mix egg, buttermilk, and garlic powder in a small bowl. Pour mixture into the bag with chicken. Seal and refrigerate for 2 to 4 hours.
2. Mix together flour, bread crumbs, baking powder, and salt in another large, resealable plastic bag.
3. Remove chicken from the refrigerator; drain and discard buttermilk mixture. Place chicken in the bag with flour mixture; seal, then shake to coat.
4. Heat oil in a large, heavy skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
5. Carefully place coated chicken into the skillet. Fry in hot oil until golden brown and juices run clear. Transfer chicken to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
