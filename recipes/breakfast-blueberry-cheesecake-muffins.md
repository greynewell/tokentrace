## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- 2  eggs, beaten
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- 1 cup white sugar
- ½ cup heavy whipping cream
- 1 cup fresh blueberries

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin or line cups with paper liners.
2. Stir flour, baking powder, and baking soda together in a bowl; set aside.
3. Beat eggs with an electric mixer in a bowl on medium speed until light and frothy. Beat cream cheese in a large bowl with an electric mixer until fluffy. Add sugar and mix to form a smooth paste. Add beaten eggs and beat with an electric mixer until a smooth creamy batter forms, 4 to 5 minutes.
4. Fold cream and blueberries into the batter and mix until just combined. Add flour mixture and fold in just until absorbed.
5. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 2/3 full.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed and muffins are lightly browned, about 20 minutes. Cool in the tin for 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
