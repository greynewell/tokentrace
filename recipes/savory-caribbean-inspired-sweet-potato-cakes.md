## Ingredients

- 2  sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes
- 1 tablespoon canola oil
- 1  fresh jalapeno chile, seeded and finely chopped
- 3  green onions with tops, thinly sliced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon brown sugar
- ¼ teaspoon allspice
- salt and pepper to taste
- ¼ cup canola oil

## Instructions

1. Place the sweet potatoes in a pan, and fill with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook until potatoes are easily pierced with fork, about 10 minutes. Drain, place the potatoes in a mixing bowl, and mash.
2. Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon canola oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in the jalapeno pepper, green onions, and garlic. Cook and stir until the vegetables are soft, about 5 minutes. Stir the vegetables, brown sugar, and allspice into the mashed sweet potatoes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
3. Form the sweet potato mixture into 12 slightly flattened cakes about 2 to 2 1/2 inches in diameter using your hands or large spoons. Place on a plate.
4. Heat 1/4 cup canola oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place the sweet potato cakes in the skillet, four at a time, and cook, turning once, until golden brown on each side, 6 to 8 minutes. Add more oil if needed.
