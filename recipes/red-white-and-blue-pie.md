## Ingredients

- 1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ cup canola oil
- 3 tablespoons cold water, or more as needed
- 1 cup white sugar
- ⅓ cup all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 2 cups chopped rhubarb
- 2 cups blueberries
- 1 dash lemon juice
- 2 tablespoons butter

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Measure flour and salt into a bowl. Add oil and mix well. Sprinkle water in 1 tablespoon at a time, mixing until dough almost cleans the side of the bowl. Gather dough into your hands and press into a ball. Divide dough in half and flatten each piece into a 1/2-inch thick round. Let rest about 30 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, combine sugar, flour, and cinnamon in a bowl to make filling. Fold in rhubarb and blueberries, and sprinkle with lemon juice. Stir filling to combine.
4. Roll dough rounds out to the size of the pie pan and place 1 round into the pan for the bottom crust. Pour filling into crust and dot with butter. Cover with remaining dough round and flute edges together to seal. Use a knife to cut 1 or 2 steam holes in the top crust. Place aluminum foil around the edges of the pie to prevent burning.
5. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove foil and bake until crust is golden brown, about 15 minutes more.
