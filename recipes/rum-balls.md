## Ingredients

- 1 (12 ounce) box vanilla wafer cookies (such as Nilla®)
- 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
- ¼ cup light corn syrup
- ¾ cup dark rum (such as Meyer's®)
- 1 cup confectioners' sugar, plus more for dusting

## Instructions

1. Place vanilla cookies in a food processor and process into fine crumbs.
2. Heat chocolate chips and corn syrup together in a saucepan over low heat. Cook, stirring often, until chocolate is melted and smooth, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in rum and confectioners' sugar until smooth. Fold in cookie crumbs; dough will be sticky.
3. Place saucepan in the refrigerator until dough is firm and easy to roll, about 15 minutes. Cover 2 plates with waxed paper; dust with confectioners' sugar.
4. Roll dough into 1-inch balls and place on the prepared plates. Dust rum balls with confectioners' sugar. Refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes.
5. Remove rum balls from refrigerator and transfer to a resealable bag, including the extra confectioners' sugar. Seal the bag and shake to coat the rum balls completely with confectioners' sugar.
