## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 tablespoons garlic-pepper seasoning (such as McCormick®)
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 pinch sea salt
- 1 pinch ground black pepper
- 3 pounds Alaskan king salmon
- 5 large mushrooms, cut into 1/4-inch pieces
- ¼ cup butter

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
2. Combine olive oil, garlic seasoning, chives, lemon juice, garlic, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl until well blended.
3. Place salmon on a baking sheet and coat with the garlic mixture; reserve any remaining mixture.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, 20 to 30 minutes.
5. While salmon bakes, heat a large skillet over medium to medium-high heat.
6. Add mushrooms and the rest of the garlic mixture.
7. Cook and stir until mushrooms shrink slightly, 3 to 5 minutes.
8. Add butter; cook and stir until mushrooms are mostly tender, 2 to 3 minutes more.
