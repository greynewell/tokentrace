## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon fine salt
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ⅛ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
- 8 ounces fresh ricotta cheese, well drained
- ½ cup pumpkin puree
- 2 tablespoons pumpkin puree
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 2  large eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- Canola oil, for frying

## Instructions

1. Whisk flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a bowl.
2. Whisk ricotta, 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons pumpkin puree, sugar, eggs, and vanilla together in a separate mixing bowl until smooth. Pour mixture into dry ingredients. Mix together until mixture becomes a loose batter.
3. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
4. Use one spoon to scoop out a heaping tablespoon of dough and a second spoon to carefully push dough into hot oil. Fry in batches for about 1 minute. If zeppole don't turn over by themselves after 1 minute, gently turn each with a strainer to brown on the other side, about 1 more minute. Remove with a strainer and drain on cooling rack.
