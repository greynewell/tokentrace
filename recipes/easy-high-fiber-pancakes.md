## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups all-purpose baking mix (such as Bisquick®)
- ¼ cup bran meal
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 2 tablespoons ground flax seeds
- 1 tablespoon chia seeds
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 cup milk
- 2 large eggs
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 tablespoon butter, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Whisk together milk, eggs, oil, and vanilla together in a medium bowl.
2. Whisk together baking mix, bran meal, sugar, ground flax seeds, chia seeds, and baking powder together in a large bowl. Make a well in the center; add 1 tablespoon egg mixture into the well and whisk until well combined. Continue adding and whisking in egg mixture, 1 tablespoon at a time, until batter has thickened and takes 1 to 2 seconds to fall off the whisk.
3. Heat a griddle over medium-high heat; grease with butter.
4. Working in batches, drop 1/3 cup batter onto the griddle about 4 inches apart; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip gently and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter, greasing the griddle with more butter if needed.
