## Ingredients

- ½ cup dark beer
- 3 tablespoons honey
- ½ teaspoon ground turmeric
- ⅛ teaspoon ground allspice
- ½ cup stone-ground spicy mustard
- 6  miniature multi-colored sweet peppers, halved lengthwise, seeds removed
- 5 links bratwurst, cut into 1-inch chunks

## Instructions

1. Combine beer, honey, turmeric, and allspice in a small saucepan; bring to a boil.
2. Reduce heat to medium and simmer, uncovered, until volume has reduced by half, about 8 minutes.
3. Stir in mustard and let stand until ready to serve.
4. Place sweet peppers and bratwurst chunks in a single layer in the air fryer basket.
5. Cook in the air fryer at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C), tossing once halfway through cooking, until peppers are tender and bratwurst edges are golden brown and crisp, about 10 minutes.
6. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the brats should read 165 degrees F (75 degreed C).
7. Work in batches if necessary.
8. Serve warm with mustard sauce.
