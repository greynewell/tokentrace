## Ingredients

- 1 (15 ounce) package pastry for 9-inch double-crust pie
- 1 cup white sugar
- 3 tablespoons strong brewed Earl Grey tea
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon ground ginger
- ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 4 cups peeled and sliced Granny Smith apples
- 2 tablespoons butter

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a 9-inch pie plate with 1 pie crust.
2. Combine sugar, tea, flour, lemon juice, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and salt in a large bowl. Mix well.
3. Spread a layer of apples over the pie crust. Sprinkle some of the sugar mixture on top. Repeat layers until the pie plate is full.
4. Dot butter over the apples. Cover with second pie crust. Press edges together to seal; trim any excess. Poke holes in the top with a fork so steam can escape.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden brown, 40 to 50 minutes. Cool completely before slicing.
