## Ingredients

- 4 ½ cups all-purpose flour, divided
- 3 tablespoons white sugar
- 2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
- 2 teaspoons dried basil
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- ¾ teaspoon garlic powder
- ¾ teaspoon dried rosemary
- ¾ cup milk
- ½ cup water
- 4 tablespoons butter
- 1  egg
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 teaspoon dried basil

## Instructions

1. Combine 1 1/2 cups flour, sugar, yeast, basil, salt, oregano, garlic powder, and rosemary in a large bowl.
2. Combine milk, water, and butter in a small microwave-safe bowl. Heat in a microwave until butter melts, about 30 seconds. Pour over the flour mixture; beat until dough is just moistened. Add egg; beat until smooth. Stir in remaining 3 cups flour to form a soft dough.
3. Turn dough onto a floured surface such as a large cutting board or countertop. Knead until smooth and elastic, about 4 minutes. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes.
4. Divide dough into thirds. Shape each piece into a 15-inch rope. Transfer ropes to a greased baking sheet. Braid together. Pinch ends to seal; tuck under the braid. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 25 minutes.
5. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Brush top of the braid with olive oil and sprinkle with basil.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet, or remove to a wire rack.
