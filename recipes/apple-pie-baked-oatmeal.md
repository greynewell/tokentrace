## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 2 ½ cups uncooked rolled oats
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon ground ginger
- ½ teaspoon ground allspice
- ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ¼ teaspoon ground cardamom
- 1 cup chopped toasted pecans, divided
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ¾ teaspoon kosher salt
- 5 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided
- ½ cup brown sugar, divided
- 2 cups whole milk
- 1 large egg, lightly beaten
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- 2 large Honeycrisp apples, peeled and diced, divided
- 2 tablespoons maple syrup

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease an 11x7-inch baking dish with baking spray.
2. Place oats in a large skillet over medium heat; toast, stirring often, until oats are beginning to brown and smell nutty, about 4 minutes. Add cinnamon, ginger, allspice, nutmeg, and cardamom; continue toasting, stirring frequently, for another 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a medium mixing bowl and cool slightly.
3. Add 3/4 cup pecans, baking powder, and salt to the oat mixture; stir to combine.
4. Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a large microwave-safe bowl. Whisk in 6 tablespoons brown sugar. Add milk, egg, and vanilla to the bowl, whisking until combined. Stir the oat mixture evenly into the milk mixture. Fold in 1/2 of the apple pieces. Spoon mixture into the prepared pan.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and set, 35 to 40 minutes.
6. While the oatmeal bakes, add remaining butter and apple pieces to a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add remaining brown sugar and maple syrup. Cook, stirring often, until apples soften and the liquid thickens into a syrup, 8 to 10 minutes.
7. Spoon apple mixture over the baked oatmeal after you've removed it from the oven. Sprinkle remaining pecans over the top.
