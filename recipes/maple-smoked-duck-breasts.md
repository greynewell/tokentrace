## Ingredients

- 2  boneless duck breast halves, skin on
- 2 tablespoons kosher salt
- 2 teaspoons cracked black pepper
- 3 tablespoons maple syrup
- 2 teaspoons maple syrup
- maple wood chips

## Instructions

1. Season duck breasts on all sides with salt and pepper. Place in a shallow dish and cover with 3 tablespoons maple syrup. Cover, place in refrigerator, and allow to marinate 12 to 24 hours.
2. Preheat an electric smoker according to manufacturer's directions to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C) using maple wood chips.
3. Remove duck breasts from marinade and rinse well. Pat dry with paper towels. Use a sharp knife to cut shallow cross-hatch marks into duck breast skin; do not cut all the way through to the meat. Brush with 2 teaspoons maple syrup.
4. Place duck breasts, skin-side up, on grill rack in the smoker. Place a drip pan underneath. Smoke at 225 degrees F (110 degrees C) for 3 to 4 hours, adding more maple wood chips as necessary to keep smoke continuous, until duck breasts reach an internal temperature of 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Cool to room temperature before slicing. Keep refrigerated until ready to serve.
