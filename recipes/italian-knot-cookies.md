## Ingredients

- 1 cup white sugar
- ½ cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
- ½ cup margarine
- ¼ cup milk
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- ¼ teaspoon almond extract
- 6 large eggs
- 4 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup confectioners' sugar
- 1 tablespoon milk, or more as needed
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice  (Optional)
- 1 tablespoon colored sugar or festive sprinkles  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
2. Cream sugar, butter, margarine, milk, vanilla extract, and almond extract together in a large bowl. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating briefly after each addition.
3. Combine flour, baking powder, and salt; add 1 cup at a time to the creamed mixture until a dough forms, using your hands if and when necessary. Turn out onto a floured board and knead briefly until smooth and a bit sticky, but not sticking to your hands. Set aside to rest for 5 minutes.
4. Pull off small pieces of dough, 1 at a time, and roll into a rope. Gently place one end towards the middle, followed by the other end, in a way to slightly overlap each other. Repeat to form remaining cookies and place on the prepared cookie sheets.
5. Bake in the preheated oven in batches until just turning a light brown on the bottom, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove to a wire rack and allow to cool slightly.
6. Meanwhile mix confectioners sugar, milk, and lemon juice together in a small bowl to form a thin glaze. Dip warm cookies in the glaze and sprinkle with sugar or sprinkles. Let set on waxed paper or a cooling rack to dry.
