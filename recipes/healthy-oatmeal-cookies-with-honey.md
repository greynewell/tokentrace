## Ingredients

- 1 ¼ cups quick oats
- 1 cup white whole wheat flour
- 1 ½ teaspoons baking powder
- 1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon kosher salt
- ½ cup honey
- ¼ cup unsweetened applesauce
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled
- 1 large egg
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ⅓ cup dark chocolate chips  (Optional)
- ¼ cup chopped walnuts  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Whisk oats, flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and kosher salt together in a large bowl.
2. Combine honey, applesauce, butter, egg, and vanilla extract in a medium bowl. Whisk until blended. Pour into the bowl with the flour mixture; stir until just combined. Fold chocolate chips and walnuts into the batter.
3. Place batter in the refrigerator and let chill at least 30 minutes or up to 3 days.
4. When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and place a rack in the center. Line a large, rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking sheet.
5. Remove chilled dough from the refrigerator. Let sit for 5 to 10 minutes if very stiff.
6. Drop dough onto the prepared baking sheet in 1 1/2-inch balls using a cookie scoop or spoon, leaving 1 inch of space around each. Gently flatten each cookie with your fingers to 3/4-inch thick.
7. Bake in the preheated oven until golden, firm around the edges, and set on top, 9 to 10 minutes.
8. Place the baking sheet on a wire rack. Let cool on the baking sheet for 2 minutes before transferring cookies to the wire rack to cool completely.
