## Ingredients

- 2 ½ cups elbow macaroni
- ¼ cup butter
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 4 cups milk
- 1 pound shredded Cheddar cheese
- ¼ cup butter, melted
- 1 sleeve buttery round crackers, crushed

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain well.
3. Melt 1/4 cup butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in flour and salt; cook, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes. Whisk in milk and simmer, stirring frequently, until mixture thickens slightly, about 5 minutes.
4. Turn off the heat and stir in Cheddar cheese until cheese is melted. Add macaroni and stir to coat; pour into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Mix the remaining 1/4 cup of melted butter and crushed crackers together in a bowl; scatter evenly over macaroni mixture.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown on top, about 45 minutes.
