## Ingredients

- 1 ¼ cups unsalted butter, softened
- ⅔ cup white sugar
- 2 cups sifted all purpose flour, divided
- 1 ¾ cups ground almonds
- ⅛ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 5 tablespoons raspberry jam
- ⅓ cup confectioners' sugar for decoration

## Instructions

1. Beat butter and sugar in a mixing bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Mix in 1/2 cup flour, then ground almonds and cinnamon. Mix in remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until well combined and dough stiffens a bit.
2. Divide dough in half and form each half into a disc. Wrap each disc tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour.
3. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
4. Working with one dough disc at a time, roll dough on a lightly floured surface to a thickness of 1/8 inch. Use a 2 1/2-inch round cookie cutter to cut as many circles from the dough as you can. Knead any leftover scraps of dough into a ball and roll it out again into a 1/8-inch-thick sheet. Cut out more circles; you should have about 12 circles.
5. Arrange dough circles on the prepared baking sheet, leaving about 1 inch of space between them. Place the baking sheet in the refrigerator while you repeat Step 4 with remaining dough disc.
6. Place the second batch of circles on the baking sheet, and cut out the center those 12 circles with a 1/2-inch round cookie cutter.
7. Bake cookies in the preheated oven until light brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and transfer to a wire rack to cool for 20 minutes.
8. Spread a thin coating of jam onto the bottom sides of the fully round cookies. Place a cut-out cookie on top of each, pressing together to form a sandwich. Place back on the wire rack, and repeat to form 11 more cookies.
9. Sift confectioners' sugar over the cookies, then spoon a dab of jam into the cut-out part of each cookie.
