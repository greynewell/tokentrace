## Ingredients

- 2 ½ teaspoons active dry yeast
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 2 tablespoons margarine, softened
- 1 cup water
- 1 cup margarine
- 1 cup packed brown sugar
- 1 cup raisins

## Instructions

1. Remove the baking pan from the machine. Place yeast, flour, cinnamon, salt, white sugar, 2 tablespoons margarine, and water in the order recommended for the bread machine. Make sure that no liquid comes in contact with yeast. Select dough cycle and press start.
2. Transfer dough to a floured surface; knead 10 to 12 times. Set aside to rest.
3. Melt 1 cup margarine in a medium saucepan over low heat. Stir in brown sugar and raisins until smooth. Remove from heat.
4. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a Bundt or tube pan.
5. Cut dough into 1-inch chunks. Drop a chunk at a time into brown sugar mixture to thoroughly coat. Layer dough pieces loosely in the prepared pan, staggering layers, so you're plopping each dough chunk over a space between two below. Let rise in a warm, draft-free spot until dough is just over the top of the pan, 15 to 20 minutes.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.
7. Remove from the oven and cover the pan with a plate. Holding the plate and the pan with oven mitts, flip over both until bread slides out onto the plate. Serve warm.
