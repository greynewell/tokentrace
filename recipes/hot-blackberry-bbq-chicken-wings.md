## Ingredients

- 6 ounces fresh blackberries
- ¼ cup ketchup
- ¼ cup water
- 3 medium fresh jalapeno peppers, sliced
- 3 tablespoons cider vinegar
- 2 tablespoons honey
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon liquid smoke flavoring
- 2 medium limes, juiced
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 1 tablespoon water
- 2 pounds chicken wings
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
2. Combine blackberries, ketchup, 1/4 cup water, jalapenos, vinegar, honey, garlic, and liquid smoke in a small saucepan. Stir in lime juice and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes.
3. Mix together cornstarch and 1 tablespoon water in a cup; stir mixture into the sauce. Simmer until slightly thickened and syrupy, about 5 more minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.
4. Toss wings with oil in a large bowl. Season with salt and pepper and toss until evenly coated.
5. Cook wings on the preheated grill, turning occasionally, until cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes.
6. While the wings are cooking, pour sauce through a fine mesh strainer set over a container. Tap the strainer with a spoon while straining to squeeze out the last remaining drops of sauce from the residue.
7. Place grilled wings into a large, clean bowl. Add hot blackberry BBQ sauce and toss until well coated. Serve hot.
