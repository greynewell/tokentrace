- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 2  eggs
- 1 cup white sugar

- 1 quart vegetable oil for frying

## Instructions

1. Whisk the flour, flaxseed, baking powder, nutmeg, and cinnamon together in a bowl until evenly blended; set aside.
2. Beat the eggs and sugar together in a separate bowl; whisk the buttermilk and 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil into the egg mixture.
