## Ingredients

- ¼ cup King Arthur Coconut Flour
- ¼ cup King Arthur Gluten-Free Flour
- ¼ cup sugar
- ¼ cup softened unsalted butter
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1  large egg
- ⅛ teaspoon coconut flavoring, for stronger flavor  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
2. Lightly grease a baking sheet, or line it with parchment.
3. Mix all the ingredients, by hand or mixer, until a well-blended, cohesive dough forms; this will take about 2 minutes at medium-low speed in a stand mixer.
4. Drop the cookie dough by teaspoonfuls onto the prepared baking sheet (a teaspoon cookie scoop works well here), leaving 1 inch between them; these cookies won't spread much when they bake.
5. Use a fork to flatten each cookie to about 1/4 inch thick, making a cross-hatch design.
6. Bake the cookies for 8 to 12 minutes, until just browned on the bottom.
7. Allow the cookies to cool completely on the baking sheet.
