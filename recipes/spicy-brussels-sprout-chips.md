## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 ½ teaspoons Dijon mustard
- ¼ teaspoon sea salt
- 1 pinch red pepper flakes
- 1 pound Brussels sprouts

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Place a rack in the top third of the oven. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
2. Mix together olive oil, Dijon mustard, sea salt, and red pepper flakes in a large bowl to make sauce.
3. Trim stems of Brussels sprouts to release outermost leaves, about 5 leaves from each sprout. Reserve cores to roast another time. Place leaves in sauce in the bowl, tossing with your fingers until leaves are evenly coated. Spread leaves on the prepared baking sheet in a single layer.
4. Roast leaves in the preheated oven until wilted and lightly browned, about 15 minutes. Transfer any crispy leaves to a serving plate; continue roasting, removing crispy leaves every 5 minutes, until all leaves are crispy, about 10 minutes more.
