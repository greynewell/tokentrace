## Ingredients

- 6 slices bacon
- 1 bunch collard greens, chopped
- ⅓ cup vegetable oil
- 3 cups water, plus more as needed
- 3 cubes  chicken bouillon
- ⅓ cup creamy peanut butter
- 1 teaspoon liquid smoke flavoring
- 1 pinch soul food seasoning, or to taste
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
- salt to taste
- ground black pepper to taste
- 2 (6 ounce) fillets flounder

## Instructions

1. Place bacon in a large deep skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate and crumble.
2. Heat collard greens, vegetable oil, water, and chicken bouillon in a large pot over medium heat. Simmer until greens are wilted, about 10 minutes. Stir crumbled bacon, peanut butter, liquid smoke, soul food seasoning, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper into the pot; cover and simmer until greens are very tender and peanut butter begins to separate, about 1 1/2 hours. Add more water if mixture becomes too dry.
3. Stir flounder fillets into greens. Continue to cook, stirring frequently, until fish breaks down, about 30 minutes more.
