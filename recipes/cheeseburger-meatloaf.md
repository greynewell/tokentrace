## Ingredients

- 2 pounds ground beef
- ¾ cup fresh bread crumbs
- ½ cup minced onion
- 2  eggs, beaten
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt
- 1 ½ teaspoons ground black pepper
- 3 cups shredded Cheddar cheese

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Combine beef, bread crumbs, onion, eggs, salt, and pepper in a large bowl; mix well. Pat out meat mixture into a 14x18-inch rectangle on a piece of wax paper.
3. Spread cheese over meat, leaving a 3/4 inch border along the edges. Roll up jelly-roll fashion to enclose the filling and form a pinwheel loaf. Press meat in on both ends to enclose cheese. Place meatloaf in a 10x15-inch baking dish.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of meatloaf should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
