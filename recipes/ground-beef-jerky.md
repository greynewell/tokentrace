## Ingredients

- 2 teaspoons canning salt
- 1 teaspoon chili powder
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- ¼ teaspoon ground ginger
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste  (Optional)
- 1 pound extra lean ground beef

## Instructions

1. Stir salt, chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, ginger, black pepper, and cayenne pepper together in a large bowl; add ground beef and mix well.
2. Pass beef mixture through a meat grinder set with the finest blade.
3. Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Place wire-racks onto baking sheets.
4. Place 1/2 ground beef mixture between two sheets of heavy plastic on a solid, level surface. Firmly roll beef mixture to a thickness of 1/8 inch. Remove the top layer of plastic wrap, invert beef mixture onto prepared baking sheet, and remove the bottom layer of plastic wrap. Repeat for remaining beef mixture.
5. Bake beef mixture in the preheated oven with the oven door slightly ajar for 2 1/2 hours. Rotate the baking sheet. Bake until jerky is cooked through, another 3 hours. Remove jerky from oven and cut into strips while warm.
