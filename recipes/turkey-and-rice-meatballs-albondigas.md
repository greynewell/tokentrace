## Ingredients

- 1 pound ground turkey thigh meat
- 1 cup packed, cooked white long grain rice
- 3 cloves crushed garlic
- ¼ cup chopped Italian flat leaf parsley
- 1  large egg
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon dried oregano
- ⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 2 ½ cups prepared tomato sauce
- 1 cup chicken broth, plus more as needed
- ⅓ cup creme fraiche
- 1 tablespoon sherry vinegar
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 2 tablespoons chopped Italian flat leaf parsley
- salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil and oil the surface lightly.
2. Mix ground turkey, cooked rice, garlic, parsley, egg, salt, paprika, cumin, pepper, oregano, cayenne, and olive together in a bowl using a fork. Portion mixture with a small scoop (between 1/4 and 1/3 cup) and place on prepared foil-lined baking sheet. Use your (wet) hands to form into round meatballs. Bake in preheated oven until browned, about 15 minutes.
3. Pour chicken broth and prepared tomato sauce in a saucepan. Whisk in creme fraiche, sherry vinegar, and paprika. Transfer meatballs to tomato sauce. Set heat to medium high and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low and simmer until tender, 60 to 90 minutes. If sauce gets too thick, add a splash or 2 of broth or water. Remove from heat. Stir in parsley, salt, and pepper.
