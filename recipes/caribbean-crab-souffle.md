## Ingredients

- ½ cup sweetened, flaked coconut
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
- ⅓ cup celery tops
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- ½ teaspoon curry powder
- ½ teaspoon dried thyme
- ½ teaspoon red pepper flakes
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ground black pepper to taste
- 3 tablespoons unbleached all-purpose flour
- 1 ¼ cups milk
- 4  egg yolks
- ½ pound crabmeat
- 6  egg whites, stiffly beaten
- ¼ teaspoon fresh lemon juice

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Butter a 8 cup souffle dish.
2. Toast coconut in a non-stick skillet over low heat.
3. In a medium skillet, melt butter over low heat and add the celery, garlic, curry powder, thyme, red pepper flakes, salt and pepper - cook for 3 minutes. Stir in flour until smooth for about 1 minute. Pour in milk and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture comes to a boil and thickens. Set aside and cool slightly. Whisk the egg yolks one at a time into the sauce. Stir in coconut and crab meat.
4. In medium bowl, beat egg whites and lemon juice with a mixer until stiff, but not dry. Stir 1/4 of the whites into crab mixture. Quickly and gently fold in the remaining whites. Do not deflate the volume. Transfer mixture to the souffle dish and place it on a rack at the bottom of the oven.
5. Bake for 30 minutes or until golden, puffed and still moist inside.
