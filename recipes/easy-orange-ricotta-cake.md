## Ingredients

- 1 (15.25 ounce) package orange cake mix (such as Duncan Hines® Orange Supreme)
- 4 large eggs
- 1 cup whole-milk ricotta cheese
- ⅓ cup canola oil
- ¼ cup orange juice
- 1 tablespoon grated orange zest
- ½ teaspoon orange extract
- 1 cup powdered sugar
- 2 tablespoons orange juice, or as needed
- 1 tablespoon grated orange zest

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a fluted tube pan (such as Bundt®).
2. Prepare cake: combine cake mix, eggs, ricotta cheese, oil, orange juice, orange zest, and orange extract in a large bowl. Mix until batter is well combined. Pour batter into prepared pan.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 45 to 55 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool in the pan for 15 minutes. Carefully invert onto a serving platter and let cool completely, about 1 hour.
4. Prepare glaze: mix powdered sugar, orange juice, and orange zest together in a small bowl. Drizzle glaze over the cooled cake.
