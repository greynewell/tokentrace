## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 tablespoon ground black pepper
- 1 (3 pound) boneless top loin pork roast

## Instructions

1. Combine oil, pepper, and salt in a bowl; rub oil mixture over pork and refrigerate while the oven preheats.
2. Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C).
3. Place pork on a roasting rack set in a large roasting pan. Roast in the preheated oven for 30 minutes.
4. Remove pork from the oven and reduce the heat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Insert an instant-read thermometer into the thickest part of the center. The temperature will range from 80 to 110 degrees F (27 to 43 degrees C).
5. Allow pork to rest uncovered at room temperature until the internal temperature reaches between 115 and 140 degrees F (46 and 60 degrees C), about 30 minutes.
6. Return to oven and continue to cook until internal temperature reaches 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), 15 to 30 minutes more.
7. Let the roast stand uncovered at room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes before slicing and serving.
