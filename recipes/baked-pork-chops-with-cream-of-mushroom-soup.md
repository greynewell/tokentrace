## Ingredients

- ½  yellow onion, sliced
- 4  pork chops
- 26 ounces condensed cream of mushroom soup
- ¼ cup water
- 2 cubes beef bouillon

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
2. Place onion slices on the bottom of a glass baking dish. Lay pork chops over onions. Cover chops evenly with condensed soup. Add water and bouillon, breaking up bouillon cubes to spread flavor. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.
3. Bake pork chops in the preheated oven, stirring gravy once or twice, until no longer pink in the centers, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a chop should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
