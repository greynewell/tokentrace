## Ingredients

- 4 cups all-purpose flour
- 6 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 pinch salt
- ¾ cup unsalted butter, melted
- ¾ cup white sugar
- 3 large eggs
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- ¼ cup warm water
- Icing:
- 2 cups powdered sugar
- ½ teaspoon anise extract
- 1 pinch salt
- 4 tablespoons water
- candy sprinkles

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Mix flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl.
3. Combine butter, sugar, eggs, and vanilla in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment; beat until smooth and creamy. Change to the dough hook and gradually mix in flour mixture. Add warm water and mix until a smooth dough forms.
4. Roll dough into 1 1/2-inch balls. Roll each ball out to a 4-inch long worm. Bring one end over the other, then underneath and through the middle, like a knot. Place 16 cookies on a baking sheet, four rows of four.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden, 13 to 15 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 1 minute before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
6. Repeat to bake remaining 2 batches of cookies.
7. Meanwhile, mix powdered sugar, anise extract, and salt together in a bowl. Mix in water, a little at a time, until desired consistency.
8. Dip cooled cookies upside down into the icing, then turn over onto waxed paper. Sprinkle with candy sprinkles.
