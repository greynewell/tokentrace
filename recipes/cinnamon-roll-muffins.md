## Ingredients

- 1 cup water
- ½ cup raisins
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- ¾ cup white sugar
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 2 large eggs
- ¼ cup unsalted butter, melted and cooled
- ¼ cup powdered sugar
- ¼ teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon milk, or more as needed

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line 18 muffin cups with paper liners.
2. Combine raisins and water in a small saucepan; bring to a boil. Turn off the heat and let sit for 10 minutes.
3. Stir flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt together in a large bowl. Make a well in the center.
4. Stir melted butter into the raisin-water mixture, then add eggs and mix until well beaten. Pour into the well in the flour mixture; mix quickly and lightly with a fork until moistened and lumpy; do not beat. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until golden, about 25 minutes. Cool in the tins for 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely, about 20 minutes.
6. Meanwhile, combine powdered sugar and vanilla for glaze in a bowl. Stir in 1 teaspoon milk, adding more if necessary, until thin enough to drizzle.
7. Drizzle glaze over cooled muffins.
