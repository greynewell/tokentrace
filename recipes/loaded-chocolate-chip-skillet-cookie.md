## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- ½ cup rolled oats
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon  (Optional)
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 10 tablespoons white sugar
- ½ cup butter, softened
- ½ cup packed light brown sugar
- ¼ cup shortening
- 2  eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 (12 ounce) bag semisweet chocolate chips
- ½ cup chopped pecans  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Whisk flour, oats, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt together in a medium bowl.
3. Cream white sugar, butter, brown sugar, and shortening in the bowl of a stand mixer until light and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. Add eggs, 1 at a time, mixing after each addition until fully incorporated. Mix in vanilla extract. Gradually mix in dry ingredients until combined. Stir in chocolate chips and pecans.
4. Transfer dough to a well seasoned 10-inch cast iron skillet. Press down with your fingers to distribute evenly over the bottom of the skillet.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until top is firm to the touch and edges have started to pull away from the sides of the skillet, 35 to 40 minutes.
6. Remove from the oven and let cool for about 15 to 20 minutes. Run a spatula around the edges, lifting the cookie slightly as you go around. Carefully invert cookie onto a cutting board and then invert again onto a serving platter.
