## Ingredients

- 2 (2.5 pound) heads cauliflower
- 1 tablespoon kosher salt
- 2  large eggs
- 4 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese
- 1 ounce finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, plus more for topping
- 4 cloves peeled garlic, crushed fine
- ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon dried oregano
- ⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1 tablespoon olive oil, divided

## Instructions

1. Cut cauliflower into medium-sized florets. Working in batches, pulse florets in a food processor until texture resembles rice grains. Transfer to a large pot and sprinkle with kosher salt. Cook and stir over medium-high heat until mixture is wet and soft, about 30 minutes. Reduce heat if it begins to brown. Remove from heat and allow cauliflower to cool.
2. Working in batches, transfer cauliflower to a clean cotton towel. Bring up the sides, twist the towel, and squeeze out as much liquid as possible. For this recipe, you'll need about 3 1/2 cups cooked, squeeze-dried cauliflower.
3. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a large rectangular baking dish with parchment paper, allowing the ends to extend up over the sides for easy lifting. Lightly brush parchment with olive oil.
4. Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl. Add garlic, black pepper, oregano, and cayenne pepper; whisk together until combined. Transfer cauliflower to the mixing bowl. Add shredded Cheddar cheese and grated Parmigiano-Reggiano; mix thoroughly. Transfer to the prepared baking dish. Tamp down and smooth out evenly.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until deep golden brown, about 1 hour. Allow to cool to room temperature. Cover and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, 3 or 4 hours.
6. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone mat; lightly oil the mat.
7. Lift chilled cauliflower out of the pan. Slice in half lengthwise; slice each half crosswise into thin "fries," about 1-inch wide. Arrange fries on the prepared mat, so they do not touch; brush lightly with olive oil. Sprinkle with a dusting of grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.
8. Bake in the preheated oven until deeply browned, 20 to 25 minutes. Allow to cool slightly before serving.
