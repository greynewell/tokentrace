## Ingredients

- 2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour, or more if needed
- 1 envelope Fleischmann's® RapidRise Yeast
- 1 ½ tablespoons sugar
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt
- ½ teaspoon Spice Islands® Garlic Powder
- ½ cup water
- ½ cup milk
- 1 tablespoon butter or margarine, softened
- 1  egg white
- 1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese

## Instructions

1. Combine 1-1/2 cups flour, undissolved yeast, sugar, salt and garlic powder in a large mixer bowl. Heat water, milk and butter until very warm (120 degrees F to 130 degrees F). Add to dry ingredients and beat for 2 minutes at medium speed of electric mixer, scraping bowl occasionally. Stir in enough additional flour to make a soft dough.
2. Cover and let dough rest 10 minutes in bowl.
3. Portion dough evenly into 12 to 15 greased muffin cups (2-1/2 x 1-1/4 inches).
4. Tip: Use an ice cream scoop to make portioning easier. Cover; let rise in warm, draft free place until doubled in bulk, about 35 minutes.
5. Combine egg white with 1 tablespoon water. Carefully brush tops of rolls with egg mixture; sprinkle with cheese. Bake at 375 degrees F for 15 to 18 minutes, or until lightly browned on top. Remove from pans and cool on wire rack.
