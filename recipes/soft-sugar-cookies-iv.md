## Ingredients

- ⅔ cup shortening
- ⅔ cup butter
- 1 ½ cups white sugar
- 2  eggs
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 3 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ⅓ cup granulated sugar for decoration

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place decorating sugar in a small bowl (or use several colors and separate bowls).
2. Beat shortening and butter in the bowl of a stand mixer until smooth and creamy, 2 to 3 minutes. Mix in sugar until incorporated, then mix in eggs, one at a time, scraping the sides of the bowl as necessary. Mix in vanilla.
3. Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl until combined. Gradually add to the wet ingredients and mix until incorporated and the dough comes together.
4. Roll dough into walnut-sized balls. Roll each ball in sugar to coat, then place 2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheets.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until light brown on the bottoms, 10 to 12 minutes, switching racks halfway through. Remove from the oven and transfer to wire racks to cool.
