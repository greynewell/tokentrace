## Ingredients

- ½ cup butter at room temperature
- 1 cup white sugar
- 2  eggs
- 1 tablespoon orange zest  (Optional)
- 1 teaspoon orange extract
- ¼ teaspoon almond extract
- 2 ¾ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 (6 ounce) package sweetened dried cranberries (such as Craisins®), or more to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Beat butter and sugar together in a bowl until mixture is creamy. Beat in eggs, orange zest, orange extract, and almond extract.
3. Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl; mix dry ingredients into moist ingredients to make a stiff dough. Mix sweetened cranberries into dough. Form dough into a ball, cut into halves, and shape each half into a log. Place logs onto prepared baking sheet.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are lightly browned, 20 to 25 minutes. Let logs cool completely on wire racks.
