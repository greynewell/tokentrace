## Ingredients

- 1 cup graham cracker crumbs
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- ¼ cup melted butter
- 2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
- 1 cup sour cream
- ¾ cup white sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 4  eggs
- 2 cups frozen blueberries, dry pack
- ⅓ cup blueberry jelly

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 325 degree F (165 degrees C).
2. Mix graham crumbs, melted butter, and 2 tablespoons sugar in a bowl until well combined. Pat mixture into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan.
3. Mash cream cheese in a mixing bowl until soft and creamy. Gradually beat in sour cream, 3/4 cup sugar, flour, and vanilla. Beat in eggs, one at a time. Pour mixture into the crumb-lined pan.
