## Ingredients

- 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour, or as needed
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ⅔ cup sourdough starter
- 1 large egg
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a large baking sheet.
2. Mix 2 cups of flour and salt together in a large mixing bowl. Add sourdough starter, egg, and vegetable oil. Mix well. Add remaining flour as needed. Dough should not be very sticky; if it comes out sticky, add more flour as needed, until it reaches a consistency that can be easily kneaded.
3. Knead dough until smooth, 5 to 8 minutes.
4. Roll dough out until it is fairly thin, roughly 1/4 inch. Place dough on the prepared baking sheet.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 30 minutes.
