## Ingredients

- 4 pounds medium shrimp - peeled and deveined
- ½ cup corn oil
- ½ cup all-purpose flour
- 1 cup chicken broth
- 1 (3 pound) whole chicken
- 2 medium onions, chopped
- 5 stalks celery, chopped
- 1 medium green bell pepper, chopped
- 5 large tomatoes, chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 2  bay leaves
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 2 tablespoons Old Bay Seasoning TM
- 1 tablespoon ground cayenne pepper
- 3 (6 ounce) cans crab meat, drained
- 1 pound andouille sausage, diced
- 2 tablespoons file powder

## Instructions

1. Peel and devein shrimp. Place shrimp into a bowl; cover and refrigerate until needed. Place shrimp heads and shells into a large pot.
2. Pour 2 quarts water into the pot, cover, and simmer over medium-low heat until liquid is reduced by half. Strain out and discard shrimp heads and shells. Reserve shrimp broth.
3. Heat oil in a very large stockpot over medium-high heat. Add flour; cook and stir with a long-handled spoon until dark brown and flour puffs and starts to absorb oil, 3 to 4 minutes. Slowly stir in chicken broth and 1 cup water. Place chicken into the pot; add tomatoes, onions, celery, bell pepper, garlic, seafood seasoning, salt, cayenne pepper, and bay leaves. Bring to a boil and cook until chicken is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 1 1/2 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
4. Remove chicken from the pot and set aside until cool enough to handle. Remove and discard bones; chop meat into 1-inch pieces.
5. Return chopped chicken to the pot, along with reserved shrimp broth, crab meat, sausage, shrimp, and filé powder; stir from the bottom of the pot to combine. Bring to a boil, then immediately remove from the heat.
6. Stir gumbo from the bottom for 1 minute. Remove bay leaves and serve.
