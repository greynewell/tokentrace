## Ingredients

- 2 large leeks, thinly sliced (white and pale green parts only)
- 10 ounces bacon, cut into small pieces
- 2 large cloves garlic, sliced
- 1 pound yellow potatoes, cut into bite-size cubes
- 2  bay leaves
- 1 (32 fluid ounce) container chicken stock
- 4 cups loosely packed fresh spinach, chopped
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth, or to taste
- ¾ cup half-and-half, or to taste
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Put leeks in a bowl with enough water to cover completely. Set aside to soak.
2. Heat a large pot over medium-high heat. Fry bacon in the hot pot until crisp, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove bacon with a slotted spoon to a plate lined with paper towels to drain. Remove all but 2 tablespoons bacon drippings from the pot.
3. Drain leeks and shake vigorously to dry. Fry leeks and garlic in reserved bacon drippings until translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir potatoes into leeks; add bay leaves. Pour chicken stock over potatoes; bring to a simmer and cook until potatoes are tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
4. Scoop about 1/2 of the potatoes, leeks, and garlic into a food processor bowl with enough liquid to cover; process until puréed. Stir purée, bacon, spinach, and half-and-half into the pot; continue heating soup until again hot, 1 to 2 minutes. Add chicken broth from the can or half-and-half to achieve desired consistency.
