## Ingredients

- 1 (5 pound) roasting chicken, rinsed, giblets removed
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 pinch dried rosemary, or to taste
- 1 pinch dried parsley, or to taste
- 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- 2 teaspoons cornstarch  (Optional)
- 1 cup chicken stock

## Instructions

1. Rub chicken on all sides with salt, pepper, garlic powder, rosemary, and parsley.
2. Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and select Saute function. Heat olive oil and add chicken, breast-side down. Cook until skin is browned, about 5 minutes. Use tongs to flip chicken and brown on the other side for another 5 minutes. Carefully remove chicken from the pot and set aside. Pour in chicken stock and deglaze the pan, scraping off all the browned bits.
3. Place the rack insert into the pot and return chicken to the pot, breast-side up. Close and lock the lid.
4. Select Poultry setting and set timer for 28 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
5. Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, 10 to 40 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Carefully remove chicken to a carving board to rest.
6. Turn on Saute function and whisk cornstarch into the pot with the stock and drippings to make a gravy.
