## Ingredients

- ¾ cup sweetened condensed milk
- 1 ½ teaspoons peppermint extract
- 4 cups confectioners' sugar
- 3 cups semisweet chocolate chips
- 2 teaspoons shortening

## Instructions

1. Line a baking sheet with waxed paper.
2. Combine condensed milk and peppermint extract in a large mixing bowl; beat in enough confectioners' sugar, a little at a time, to form a stiff dough that is no longer sticky.
3. Form peppermint mixture into 1-inch balls and place on waxed paper; flatten with fingers to form patties. Let patties dry at room temperature for two hours, turning once.
4. Stir chocolate and shortening in a medium saucepan over low heat until melted; remove from heat. Dip patties, one at a time, into chocolate by laying them on the tines of a fork and lowering the fork into the chocolate mixture; tap the fork on the edge of the pan to shake off excess. Slide the patties back onto the waxed paper and chill in the refrigerator until set.
