## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 cup water
- ⅓ cup sourdough starter
- 3 tablespoons butter, melted
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- ¾ teaspoon sea salt
- 1 teaspoon oil, or as needed
- ½ cup all-purpose flour, or more as needed
- 1 teaspoon butter, or as needed
- 1  egg, beaten

## Instructions

1. Combine 2 cups flour, water, sourdough starter, butter, sugar, and salt in a bowl. Mix into a stiff batter. Beat for a few minutes using a wooden spoon or an electric mixer; the dough should be quite moist and sticky.
2. Turn dough into an oiled bowl, flipping to coat all sides. Cover the bowl with a clean towel and leave at room temperature to ferment 8 hours to overnight.
3. Turn dough onto a liberally floured surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes, adding an additional 1/2 cup flour or more as needed; the dough should be very smooth and elastic when done.
4. Butter a loaf pan. Shape dough into a loaf and place in the prepared pan. Cover with a clean towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, 4 to 12 hours depending on temperature.
5. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
6. Brush the top of the loaf with beaten egg. Cut a 1/4-inch slash down the center lengthwise using a sharp knife.
7. Bake in the preheated oven until an internal temperature of at least 180 degrees F (82 degrees C) is reached, 25 to 30 minutes.
8. Turn loaf out onto a rack and cool completely before slicing.
