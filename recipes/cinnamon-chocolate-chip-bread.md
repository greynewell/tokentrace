## Ingredients

- 2 ½ teaspoons active dry yeast
- 3 tablespoons warm water
- cooking spray
- 1 cup warm nonfat milk
- 5 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled to room temperature
- 1  egg
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 3 ½ cups bread flour, or more as needed
- Filling and Topping:
- ½ cup white sugar
- 2 tablespoons ground cinnamon
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
- 6 (1 ounce) squares semisweet baking chocolate, chopped
- 1  egg, beaten

## Instructions

1. Dissolve yeast in warm water and let sit for 5 to 10 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, coat the inside of a large bowl with cooking spray.
3. Add warm milk, melted butter, egg, and salt to yeast mixture; whisk for 1 minute. Gradually stir in flour until dough is no longer sticky.
4. Knead dough by hand on a lightly floured surface or in a stand mixer fitted with a bread hook for 10 minutes. Transfer to the prepared bowl and turn until dough is covered in cooking spray. Cover with a damp cloth and leave in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
5. Spray a 9x5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray. Mix together sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl; set aside.
6. Remove dough from the bowl. Punch it and fold in the sides. Flatten dough with a rolling pin into a 9x18-inch rectangle. Brush on melted butter and sprinkle with all but 3 tablespoons cinnamon-sugar mixture. Sprinkle with chopped chocolate. Roll dough carefully, starting at the short end, and pinch closed at the seam. Place seam-side down in the prepared loaf pan. Cover the pan and set in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
7. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
8. Brush beaten egg on top of dough and sprinkle with remaining 3 tablespoons cinnamon-sugar mixture.
9. Bake in preheated oven until top is golden brown, 40 to 45 minutes. Carefully tip loaf out of pan onto a work surface and let it cool on a wire rack.
