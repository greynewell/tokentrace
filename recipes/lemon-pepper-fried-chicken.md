## Ingredients

- 2 cups bread crumbs
- 3 tablespoons lemon-pepper seasoning
- 2 teaspoons dried basil
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 ½ teaspoons garlic powder
- salt to taste
- 4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves

## Instructions

1. Mix bread crumbs, lemon-pepper seasoning, basil, oregano, garlic powder, and salt together in a shallow dish.
2. Pat chicken pieces dry with paper towels, dip in beaten eggs, and dredge through bread crumb mixture.
