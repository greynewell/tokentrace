## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- ½ cup granulated sugar substitute (such as Swerve®)
- 2 teaspoons lemon zest  (Optional)
- 1 large egg, at room temperature
- 2 ½ tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
- 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ½ teaspoon lemon extract
- ½ cup almond milk, at room temperature
- 1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 ¼ teaspoons baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons poppy seeds
- 1 ¼ cups powdered sugar substitute (such as Swerve®)
- 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon almond milk, at room temperature
- 1 teaspoon lemon zest  (Optional)
- ¼ teaspoon vanilla extract
- ⅛ teaspoon salt

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray 2 donut pans with nonstick cooking spray.
2. Place granulated sugar substitute and lemon zest in a bowl. Mix until zest is fully coated with sugar. Add egg, butter, lemon juice, vanilla, and lemon extract. Add almond milk and mix until well incorporated.
3. Sift flour, baking powder, and salt together. Add to the sugar mixture. Fold in poppy seeds. Divide the batter evenly among the donut pans.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into a donut comes out clean, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes. Remove from the pans and cool completely.
5. While the donuts cool, make the icing. Mix powder sugar substitute, lemon juice, almond milk, lemon zest, vanilla, and salt together in a bowl. Set a rack over a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. Dip donuts into the icing and place on the rack until glaze sets, 2 to 3 minutes.
