## Ingredients

- 1  egg white
- ¼ cup light brown sugar
- ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 2 cups coarsely chopped pecans
- 4 cups arugula
- ½ cup crumbled Gorgonzola cheese
- 2 teaspoons hazelnut oil

## Instructions

1. Preheat an oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Beat egg whites until foamy in a large glass or metal mixing bowl. Gradually add the sugar, continuing to beat until medium peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the tip of the peak formed by the egg whites should curl over slightly. Fold in cayenne pepper and salt. Add the pecans and stir until coated. Spread the mixture evenly on the parchment-lined baking sheet.
3. Bake 10 minutes, then turn the pecan pieces. Bake another 10 minutes until toasted. Remove from oven and let cool about 15 minutes.
4. Mound two cups of salad greens on each plate. Sprinkle each serving with 1/4 cup Gorgonzola cheese, then drizzle with a teaspoon of hazelnut oil. Top each salad with a cup of toasted pecans.
