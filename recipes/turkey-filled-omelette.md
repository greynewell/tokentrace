## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 2 teaspoons unsalted butter
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh shiitake mushroom
- 1  shallot, finely chopped
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1  fresh sage leaf, minced
- ¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
- ¼ cup shredded cooked turkey
- 1 teaspoon dry vermouth  (Optional)
- 2  eggs, chilled
- 1 pinch ground white pepper
- 2 teaspoons olive oil
- 1 tablespoon creme fraiche

## Instructions

1. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil and butter in a skillet over medium-low heat. Stir in shiitake mushroom, shallot, salt, sage, and red pepper flakes. Cook and stir until shallot is translucent, about 5 minutes. Mix in turkey and vermouth; stir until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the skillet from heat.
2. Beat eggs with a fork in a bowl until well blended; season with a pinch of salt and white pepper.
3. Heat 2 teaspoons olive oil in an omelet pan over medium heat until hot. Pour beaten eggs into the pan. Use a spatula to gently stir eggs just until they begin to set, 1 to 2 minutes; shake the pan to cover the bottom completely with egg. Smooth the top of partially set eggs with the spatula; cook until the bottom is firm and the top is still slightly soft, then turn off heat.
4. Spoon turkey mixture into the center of omelet, filling about the middle 1/3 of the omelet; dot with small dollops of crème fraiche. Do not overfill omelet. With the spatula, fold the upper 1/3 of the omelet over filling. Gently tip the skillet and shake omelet towards the edge of the skillet. With the spatula, fold omelet over one more time, forming a loose cigar shape. Gently tip omelet onto a serving plate.
