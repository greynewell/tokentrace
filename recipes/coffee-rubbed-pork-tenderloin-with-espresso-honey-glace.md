## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons packed dark brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons instant espresso powder
- 1 tablespoon kosher salt
- 2 teaspoons honey powder
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1 teaspoon sweet paprika
- ¾ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ teaspoon onion powder
- ½ teaspoon unsweetened cocoa powder
- ¼ teaspoon ground dried chipotle pepper
- 1 (1 1/2 pound) pork tenderloin
- 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- 1 tablespoon butter
- ½ cup water
- 4 teaspoons beef demi-glace
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- 1 teaspoon honey powder

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Combine brown sugar, espresso powder, salt, honey powder, garlic powder, smoked paprika, sweet paprika, black pepper, onion powder, cocoa powder, and ground chipotle for the rub in a bowl. Mix thoroughly and transfer 1 tablespoon rub into a small bowl.
3. Place pork tenderloin on a work surface and trim off any silver skin. Pat dry with paper towels. Sprinkle the larger portion of coffee spice rub all over tenderloin, patting it on with your fingertips. Drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil on top and rub it in. Let rest at room temperature for 10 minutes.
4. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil and butter in a large, oven-proof skillet over medium-high heat. Cook pork tenderloin until browned on all sides, about 8 minutes.
5. Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven and roast tenderloin until slightly pink in the center, about 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest park of the tenderloin should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Remove from the oven, transfer to a serving platter, and let rest for 10 minutes.
6. Heat the same skillet over medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon reserved coffee spice rub, water, demi-glace, Dijon mustard, and honey powder for the sauce. Cook, stirring frequently, until sauce thickens, 3 to 4 minutes. Slice tenderloin into rounds and drizzle with sauce.
