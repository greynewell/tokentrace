## Ingredients

- 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- ¼ teaspoon white sugar
- 1 pinch salt
- ¼ cup shortening
- ⅓ cup milk
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 6  fresh peaches
- ¼ cup brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 2 teaspoons lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ⅛ cup all-purpose flour
- 2 ½ tablespoons cornstarch
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 3 pinches ground nutmeg, or to taste
- 2 pinches ground cloves, or to taste
- 1 pinch ground cardamom, or to taste
- 1 pinch ground allspice, or to taste
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
- 1 pinch salt
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 large egg, beaten
- 1 pinch ground cinnamon, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Slowly sprinkle flour into a large bowl, a tiny bit at a time. Mix in sugar and salt. Cut in shortening until sort of smooth.
3. Mix milk and oil together in a measuring cup. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and pour oil mixture in slowly, stirring to combine.
4. Separate dough smoothly into 2 balls, trying not to knead. Chill for 30 minutes.
5. Roll out dough balls into 10-inch circles. Press 1 circle into a 9-inch pie pan as evenly as possible, but don't worry about messy edges. Reserve remaining circle for the top.
6. Slice all but one peach into coarse chunks, removing skins as you go. Don't worry about removing all the skin. Toss with brown sugar, white sugar, lemon juice, and vanilla extract. Remove 2 1/2 spoonfuls of liquid from the bottom so it isn't soggy.
7. Mix flour, cornstarch, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, cardamom, allspice, cayenne, and salt together in a separate bowl.
8. Mix peaches with flour mixture until combined. Pour into the pie crust. If it's too much liquid, hold some back. Slice the remaining peach very thinly and lay in a pinwheel design over the filling. Dot butter over the top.
9. Lay the top crust gently over the top. Dip a fork in the beaten egg and use it crimp the edges to seal. Brush remaining egg over the top. Sprinkle with 1 pinch cinnamon and cut a few slits in the top.
10. Bake in the preheated oven for 35 minutes. Increase temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) and continue to bake until golden brown, about 10 minutes more. Remove from the oven and let cool at least 1 1/2 hours before slicing and serving.
