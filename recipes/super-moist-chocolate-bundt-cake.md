## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 cup white sugar
- ½ cup sweetened cocoa powder
- 1 (3.9 ounce) package instant chocolate pudding mix
- 1 ½ teaspoons baking soda
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup milk
- 1 cup vegetable oil
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 3 large eggs
- 1 cup sour cream
- ½ cup warm water

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously grease a 10-inch fluted tube pan (such as Bundt®), or use a nonstick pan.
2. Combine flour, sugar, cocoa powder, pudding mix, baking soda, and salt in a bowl. Add milk, oil, and vanilla extract. Beat with an electric mixer on low speed until combined.
