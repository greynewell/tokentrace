## Ingredients

- 1 ½ pounds russet potatoes
- ½ cup all-purpose flour
- 1  egg
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg
- ¼ cup lard or other cooking fat

## Instructions

1. Place whole potatoes in their skins into a large pot of boiling water; boil for 25 to 30 minutes. Remove potatoes, and discard water. When cool enough to handle, peel potatoes, and place on a lightly floured surface. Mash potatoes with a rolling pin.
2. Place mashed potatoes into a large bowl. Stir in flour, egg, parsley, salt, and nutmeg. Knead well to form a smooth dough. Then roll out the dough to a thickness of about 1/2 inch. Cut flattened dough into thin strips, about 1 1/2 inches long. Gently roll out the strips, or stretch them until the ends taper. Set aside for 15 minutes.
3. In a large skillet, heat lard over medium heat. Place the potato strips into the skillet, and fry until golden brown on both sides.
