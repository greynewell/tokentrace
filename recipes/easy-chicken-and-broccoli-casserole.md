## Ingredients

- 1 cup uncooked white rice
- 2 cups water
- 1 head broccoli, cut into florets
- 3 cups cubed cooked chicken
- 1 ½ cups shredded Cheddar cheese
- 2 (10.75 ounce) cans  condensed cream of chicken soup
- 1 cup fat-free plain yogurt
- ⅓ cup slivered almonds
- ¼ teaspoon curry powder
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ¼ teaspoon black pepper
- 3 tablespoons lemon juice

## Instructions

1. Bring the rice and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat.
2. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
4. Add the broccoli florets, and cook uncovered until just tender, about 4 minutes.
5. Drain in a colander, then immediately rinse with cold water for several minutes until cold to stop the cooking process.
6. Once the broccoli is cold, drain well, chop into small pieces, and place into a mixing bowl.
7. Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
8. Stir the cooked rice, chicken, Cheddar cheese, cream of chicken soup, yogurt, almonds, curry powder, garlic powder, pepper, and lemon juice into the broccoli until evenly mixed.
9. Spoon the mixture into a 9x13 inch baking dish.
10. Bake in the preheated oven until hot and bubbly, about 30 minutes.
