## Ingredients

- 2 (4 ounce) frozen tilapia fillets
- 2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 pinches garlic pepper, divided, or to taste
- 2 pinches lemon-pepper seasoning, divided, or to taste
- 1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 large lemon, juiced, divided
- ¼ cup salted butter, melted
- ½ cup fresh bread crumbs
- ¼ cup slivered almonds
- 1 teaspoon salted butter, melted

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly brush a small cast iron pan or a baking pan with olive oil.
2. Brush frozen fish with 2 teaspoons olive oil and season both sides with garlic pepper, lemon-pepper seasoning, salt, and pepper. Top with 1/2 of the lemon juice. Place fish in a broiler pan.
3. Bake in the preheated oven for 3 minutes. Turn fillets over and continue to bake, watching closely, until fish begins to flake, 3 to 5 minutes. Use a spatula to transfer fish to the prepared cast iron pan. Leave the oven on.
4. Top fish with 1/4 cup melted butter and the remaining lemon juice and season with garlic pepper, lemon-pepper seasoning, salt, and pepper. Season bread crumbs as desired and mix with slivered almonds and 1 teaspoon butter. Sprinkle over fish.
5. Bake in the preheated oven, watching closely and without turning, until golden brown on top, 5 to 7 minutes.
