## Ingredients

- 1 pound fresh asparagus, trimmed and cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
- ¼  onion, thinly sliced
- 1 (4 ounce) packet saltine crackers, crushed
- 1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 (10.75 ounce) can  condensed cream of mushroom soup
- ½ cup milk
- ½ cup coarsely chopped pecans

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Grease a 1 1/2-quart baking dish.
3. Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Cover pan and bring the water to a boil. Add asparagus, cover, and steam until just tender, 5 to 8 minutes.
4. Heat olive oil in a large skillet; cook and stir mushrooms and onion until the mushrooms have given off their liquid, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir in the asparagus, tossing vegetables just until hot. Remove from heat.
5. Mix saltine cracker crumbs, sharp Cheddar cheese, and black pepper together in a bowl; spread half the mixture into the bottom of the prepared baking dish.
6. Spoon the asparagus mixture over the crumb mixture.
7. Whisk the cream of mushroom soup and milk together in a bowl until smooth, and pour the soup mixture over the asparagus mixture.
8. Spread the remaining crumb-cheese mixture over the casserole and sprinkle with pecans.
9. Bake in the preheated oven until the casserole is bubbling, about 30 minutes.
