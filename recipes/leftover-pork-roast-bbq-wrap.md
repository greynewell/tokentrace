## Ingredients

- ½ pound cooked pork roast, shredded
- 2 (10 inch) flour tortillas
- ¼ cup barbeque sauce
- 4 slices Cheddar cheese, halved
- ½ small onion, thinly sliced into rings
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Spoon 1/2 the shredded pork onto each tortilla; top each with 2 tablespoons barbeque sauce, 4 Cheddar cheese halves, 1/2 the onion rings, salt, and pepper. Fold opposing edges of each tortilla to overlap the filling. Roll 1 of the opposing edges around the filling into a burrito-shape. Wrap each tightly with aluminum foil and place on a baking sheet.
