## Ingredients

- ¼ cup brown sugar
- ¼ cup finely chopped walnuts
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ½ cup unsalted butter, softened
- ½ cup white sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 1 cup sour cream
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 cups all-purpose flour

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease or line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners.
2. Combine brown sugar, walnuts, and cinnamon in a bowl for the filling/topping.
