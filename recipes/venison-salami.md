## Ingredients

- 5 pounds ground venison
- 2 ½ tablespoons sugar-based curing mixture (such as Morton® Quick Cure®)
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 3 tablespoons cracked peppercorns
- 4 teaspoons mustard seed
- 2 teaspoons ground black pepper
- 2 teaspoons garlic powder
- 2 teaspoons onion powder
- 2 teaspoons hickory-flavored liquid smoke
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt

## Instructions

1. Place ground venison in a large plastic bowl or bucket. Add the curing mixture, sugar, peppercorns, mustard seed, ground pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, liquid smoke, and salt. Mix well, then cover tightly and refrigerate for 24 hours.
2. On the second day, mix thoroughly, kneading as you would bread for 2 to 3 minutes. Re-cover and refrigerate for another 24 hours.
3. On the third day, mix and knead the mixture again for another 2 to 3 minutes. Refrigerate for 1 hour.
4. Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).
