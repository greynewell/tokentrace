## Ingredients

- ½ cup butter
- 2 pounds carrots, peeled, cut into equal-sized pieces
- ½ teaspoon salt, or more to taste
- ½ cup bourbon whiskey
- ⅓ cup brown sugar
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
- freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 2 sprigs fresh thyme leaves for garnish  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Melt butter in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat.
2. When butter foams up, add carrots. Season with salt and cook, stirring, until liquid from carrots evaporates and carrots begin to brown around the edges, 5 or 6 minutes.
3. Reduce heat to medium-low. Carefully pour in bourbon. Cook and stir until bourbon is almost evaporated, about 2 minutes.
4. Sprinkle in brown sugar. Stir until carrots are almost cooked through, about 5 minutes.
5. When carrots are nearly tender, raise heat to medium-high to thicken the glaze, 15 to 30 seconds.
6. Season with cayenne pepper and ground black pepper. Transfer to serving dish and garnish with fresh thyme leaves, if desired.
