## Ingredients

- 2 ½ pounds russet potatoes, peeled
- 3 ounces grated Cheddar cheese
- 3 ounces grated fontina cheese
- 1 ½ teaspoons seasoned salt
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ cup all-purpose flour
- 4  eggs
- 2 cups panko bread crumbs
- vegetable oil for frying
- salt

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add whole potatoes; boil until just soft but not mushy, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain.
2. Shred potatoes in a food processor. Transfer to a large bowl and allow to cool.
3. Mix Cheddar cheese, Fontina cheese, seasoned salt, garlic powder, and pepper into potatoes until well combined. Shape 2-tablespoon portions of potato mixture into thick, disk shapes.
4. Heat 2 inches oil in a heavy skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
5. While the oil is heating, pour flour into a bowl. Whisk eggs together in a separate bowl. Pour panko into a third bowl. Roll each potato disk in flour, coat with egg, then roll in panko to coat.
6. Fry tots in batches until crispy and golden, about 4 minutes. Cool on a paper towel-lined tray, about 5 minutes. Season with salt.
