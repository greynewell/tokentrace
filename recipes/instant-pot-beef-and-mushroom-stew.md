## Ingredients

- 2 pounds chuck roast
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon avocado oil, or more as needed
- 2 medium onions, chopped
- ½ cup minced celery
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon herbes de Provence
- 2 large bay leaves
- ½ cup red wine
- 1 ½ cups beef stock
- 3 tablespoons tomato paste
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon fish sauce
- 2 cups diced russet potatoes
- 3 (8 ounce) packages mushrooms, quartered
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch
- 2 tablespoons water

## Instructions

1. Cut roast into pieces that will fit the inner pot and pat dry with paper towels. Season one side with salt and pepper.
2. Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and select Saute function. Add enough oil to cover the entire bottom surface of the pot and wait until indicator reads "Hot". Carefully add a piece of beef to the pot, seasoned side down, and saute until nicely browned, about 6 minutes. Season the other side with salt and pepper and turn, using tongs. Brown for an additional 6 minutes and remove to a plate to keep warm. Repeat with remaining beef.
3. Add onions and saute in the drippings until softened, about 3 minutes. Add celery, garlic, herbes de Provence, and bay leaves, and saute until garlic is fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour in red wine and use a wooden spoon to stir all the browned bits off of the bottom of the pot, and cook for about 2 minutes. Turn off Saute function.
4. Cut browned beef into cubes about 1 1/2 inches thick, removing fat and any gristle. Return to the pot.
5. Stir beef stock, tomato paste, soy sauce, and fish sauce together in a small bowl. Add to the pot and stir in potatoes. Gently push meat pieces until they are at or below the liquid level.
6. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 22 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
7. Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 10 minutes. Release remaining pressure carefully, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid.
8. Stir in mushrooms. Make sure most of the mushrooms are partially submerged in the liquid. Adjust seasonings, if desired. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 15 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
9. Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 10 minutes. Release remaining pressure carefully, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid.
10. Stir stew well. Mix corn starch with water in a small bowl. Stir until there are no lumps, then stir into the pot. Select Saute function and cook until gravy is bubbly, stirring frequently, to assure that there is no sticking, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove bay leaves and serve.
