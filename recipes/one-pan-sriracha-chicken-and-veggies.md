## Ingredients

- 4  skin-on chicken thighs
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ¼ cup butter, divided
- ½  red onion, sliced
- 8 cloves garlic, minced
- 4  baby red potatoes, quartered
- 1  red bell pepper, diced
- ⅓ cup sriracha sauce
- ⅓ cup brown sugar

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Season chicken thighs with salt and pepper.
3. Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a large oven-proof skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken skin-side down in the skillet; cook until browned, about 3 minutes. Flip and cook until second side is browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Drain excess grease if desired.
4. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon butter in the skillet. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Stir in potatoes and red bell pepper; cook until tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Place chicken thighs on top.
5. Mix sriracha sauce and brown sugar together in a bowl; pour evenly over chicken.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the chicken reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C) and potatoes are browned, about 30 minutes.
