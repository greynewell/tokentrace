## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 tablespoon butter
- ½  onion, finely chopped
- 2 pounds beef sirloin, cut into cubes
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- salt to taste
- 1 cup red wine
- 2 cups beef stock
- 2 large potatoes, peeled and cubed
- 1 cup chopped carrots
- 1 (8 ounce) can tomato paste
- 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
- 2  10-inch pie crusts, rolled out to fit a 9x13-inch baking dish
- 2 tablespoons milk, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Place a baking sheet on rack in the lower third of the oven. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Heat oil and butter together in a large saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir onion until softened, about 10 minutes. Add beef; cook and stir until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute.
3. Stir flour, pepper, and salt into beef mixture; cook and stir until beef is coated, 2 to 3 minutes. Add wine; bring to boil, reduce heat, and simmer, 3 to 5 minutes.
4. Mix beef stock, potatoes, carrots, tomato paste, and Worcestershire sauce into beef mixture; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until vegetables are tender, 30 minutes to 1 hour. Remove from heat and cool.
5. Line a 9x13-inch baking dish with 1 pie crust. Spoon beef and potato filling into crust; top with remaining pie crust, crimping the 2 crusts together around the edges using a fork or your fingers. Brush top crust with milk.
6. Place baking dish on the baking sheet in the oven and cook until crust is golden brown, 40 to 45 minutes.
