## Ingredients

- 4 cups sliced potatoes
- 1 (16 ounce) can salmon, drained (liquid reserved) and salmon flaked
- 1 cup milk, or as needed
- 3 tablespoons butter
- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- ½ cup mayonnaise
- ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1 teaspoon prepared mustard

## Instructions

1. Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain.
2. Mix reserved liquid from salmon and enough milk to make a total of 2 cups together in a measuring cup or bowl.
3. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Generously grease a casserole dish.
4. Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Stir flour into melted butter and cook until dissolved, about 1 minute. Gradually add milk mixture to butter-flour mixture; cook, stirring constantly, until sauce is thickened and smooth, 5 to 10 minutes.
5. Layer potatoes, salmon, and sauce, alternating 1 or 2 times, into the prepared casserole dish.
6. Whisk mayonnaise, Parmesan cheese, Worcestershire sauce, and mustard together in a bowl; pour over casserole.
7. Bake in the preheated oven until casserole is bubbling, about 30 minutes.
