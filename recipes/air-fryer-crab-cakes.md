## Ingredients

- 1 large egg, beaten
- 2 tablespoons mayonnaise
- 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- 1 teaspoon seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®)
- ½ teaspoon hot pepper sauce
- 2 tablespoons finely chopped green onion
- 1 pound lump crabmeat, drained and picked over

## Instructions

1. Combine egg, mayonnaise, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, seafood seasoning, and hot pepper sauce in a small mixing bowl. Stir in green onion and set aside.
2. Place crab meat in a medium bowl and break up with a fork. Add milk, salt, and pepper; toss to coat. Add crushed saltines and baking powder and toss lightly to combine. Add to the egg mixture, stirring gently and being careful not to break apart the crab lumps.
