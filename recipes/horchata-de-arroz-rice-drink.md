## Ingredients

- 1 cup uncooked long grain white rice
- 3 ½ cups cold water
- 1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk
- ½ cup white sugar
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Place the rice in a bowl with enough water to cover it and let it soak overnight.
2. Strain the rice and discard the water. Stir the cold water and evaporated milk together. Place the drained rice into a blender along with half of the diluted milk. Blend until the rice is finely ground, about 30 seconds. Add the sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla; blend well. Pour in the remaining diluted milk; blend.
