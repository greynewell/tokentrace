## Ingredients

- ⅓ cup butter
- 1  onion, chopped
- ⅓ cup all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ cups chicken broth
- ⅔ cup milk
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 cup frozen green peas
- 1 cup frozen diced carrots
- 2 cups cooked, shredded chicken meat
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 ½ teaspoons baking powder
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- 5 tablespoons shortening
- ¾ cup milk

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Butter a 2-quart casserole dish.
2. In a large saucepan, sauté chopped onion in butter. Stir in flour and cook for 1 minute. Add chicken broth and milk. Heat to boiling, stirring constantly. Reduce heat to medium and cook and stir for 2 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper. Add frozen peas and carrots and cooked chicken. Pour mixture into the prepared casserole dish.
3. In a medium bowl, mix together 2 cups flour, baking powder, and 3/4 teaspoon salt. Cut in shortening until mixture is crumbly. Stir in milk just until dough is moistened, then drop by spoonfuls onto chicken mixture.
4. Bake at 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) for 12 to 15 minutes, or until biscuits are golden brown, and cooked on bottom. This tends to bubble over so I place a piece of aluminum foil under the pan to catch drips.
