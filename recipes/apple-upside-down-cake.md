## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups brown sugar, or more to taste
- 3 tablespoons ground cinnamon, divided
- 5 medium apples - peeled, cored, and sliced
- 4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ cups unsweetened apple juice
- 1 ½ cups white sugar
- 1 cup butter, softened
- 4  eggs
- ½ cup milk
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 2 teaspoons salt

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Cover the bottom of a 10x15-inch baking pan with brown sugar and 2 tablespoons cinnamon. Layer apple slices on top.
3. Place flour, apple juice, white sugar, butter, eggs, milk, remaining 1 tablespoon cinnamon, vanilla extract, baking powder, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix until completely smooth, 5 to 10 minutes; the longer you mix, the fluffier the cake will be.
4. Pour batter over apples in the baking pan, making sure they are evenly covered.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 45 to 55 minutes. Cool for 20 to 30 minutes. Place a large serving dish over the cake and carefully flip over.
