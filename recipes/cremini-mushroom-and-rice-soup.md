## Ingredients

- ¼ ounce dried porcini mushrooms
- 6 cups low-sodium chicken broth
- ½ cup long-grain rice
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme
- 2 bay leaves
- ½ teaspoon salt, divided, plus more to taste
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 pound cremini mushrooms, quartered
- 1 medium onion, minced
- ground black pepper to taste
- 2 medium carrots, chopped

## Instructions

1. Rinse dried porcini mushrooms, then mince. Transfer to a large saucepan.
2. Add chicken broth, rice, soy sauce, thyme, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and bay leaves to the saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until needed.
3. Meanwhile, melt butter in a large Dutch oven over high heat. Add cremini mushrooms, onion, and 1/4 teaspoon salt; cook until all moisture has evaporated and mushrooms begin to brown, about 10 minutes. Stir in the broth-rice mixture and carrots; bring to a simmer.
4. Cook until carrots and rice are tender, 7 to 10 minutes. Turn off heat and remove the bay leaves. Season with salt and pepper and serve.
