## Ingredients

- cooking spray (such as Pam®)
- ¾ cup white sugar
- ¼ cup butter, melted and slightly cooled
- ¼ cup sour cream
- 2  eggs, beaten
- 1 medium lemon, zested and juiced, divided
- ⅓ cup milk
- 1 ⅔ cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1 ¼ cups frozen blueberries, unthawed
- 1 tablespoon icing sugar
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray.
2. Whisk together sugar, melted butter, sour cream, eggs, and lemon juice in a large bowl until thoroughly blended. Mix in milk.
3. Stir together flour, baking powder, salt, and lemon zest in a separate bowl. Remove 2 tablespoons flour mixture and place in a third, smaller bowl with frozen blueberries; stir to coat. Stir remaining flour mixture into milk-sour cream mixture with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, blending until just combined. Fold floured blueberries into batter and transfer into the prepared loaf pan.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour.
5. Meanwhile, mix together icing sugar, lemon juice, and lemon zest in a small bowl for the topping.
6. Remove loaf from the oven and immediately poke holes all over the top with a toothpick. Pour topping over loaf and let cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Remove loaf to a wire rack to cool completely.
