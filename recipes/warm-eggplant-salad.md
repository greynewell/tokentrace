## Ingredients

- 1 pound long Chinese eggplants
- 2 teaspoons Italian seasoning, divided
- salt to taste
- 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- 1 medium red bell pepper
- 2 teaspoons white sugar
- ½ tablespoon balsamic vinegar
- 1 large clove garlic, crushed
- 2 tablespoons cream cheese, softened
- 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro

## Instructions

1. Trim eggplants and cut in half if very long. Cut lengthwise into 1/4-inch slices. Sprinkle a little Italian seasoning and salt on both sides of each slice.
2. Preheat a griddle or heavy pan over high heat. Drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil over eggplant slices and cook until slightly charred, about 30 seconds per side.
3. Core bell pepper and cut into thin slices. Season with salt. Use the same griddle or pan to cook until slightly charred, about 30 seconds per side.
4. Prepare dressing by mixing remaining olive oil, sugar, balsamic vinegar, and garlic in a small bowl. Stir in remaining Italian seasoning.
5. Layer 1/2 of the eggplant slices on a plate. Dot with cream cheese. Cover with bell peppers and remaining cream cheese. Top with remaining eggplant. Drizzle dressing over the salad. Garnish with cilantro. Serve warm, mixing right before serving.
