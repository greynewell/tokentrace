## Ingredients

- 1 cup unsalted butter
- 1 cup dark brown sugar
- 6  eggs
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1 pinch ground allspice
- 1 pinch salt
- 3  ripe bananas, mashed
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x5 inch loaf pan.
2. In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Stir in the eggs one at a time, beating well with each addition. In a separate bowl, stir together flour, baking powder, nutmeg, allspice and salt. Blend the flour mixture into the butter and egg mixture a bit at a time, beating well after each addition.. Stir in the banana and vanilla; mixing just enough to evenly combine. Pour batter into prepared pan.
3. Bake in preheated oven for 90 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into center of the loaf comes out clean. Cool the cake in the pan for 10 minutes and then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.
