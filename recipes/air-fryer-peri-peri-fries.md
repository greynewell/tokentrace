## Ingredients

- 2 pounds russet potatoes
- ¼ teaspoon smoked paprika
- ¼ teaspoon chile powder
- ¼ teaspoon garlic granules
- ⅛ teaspoon ground white pepper
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons grapeseed oil

## Instructions

1. Peel and cut potatoes into 3/8-inch slices. Place into a bowl of water for 15 minutes to remove most of the starch. Transfer onto a clean kitchen towel and dry.

4. Place the potatoes into a medium bowl and add grapeseed oil; mix well. Pour into the air fryer basket.
5. Air fry for 10 minutes, shaking occasionally. Increase the temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) and air fry until golden brown, 12 to 15 more minutes.
6. Pour fries into a bowl, sprinkle with seasoning mix, and shake the bowl to ensure fries are evenly covered. Taste and adjust salt, if necessary. Serve immediately.
