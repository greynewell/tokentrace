## Ingredients

- 4 (4 ounce) skin-on salmon fillets
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon dried dill weed
- salt and pepper to taste
- ½ pound bacon, cut in half

## Instructions

1. Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet liberally with olive oil.
2. Place the salmon fillets onto the baking sheet skin-side-down. Sprinkle the fillets with garlic powder, dill, salt, and pepper. Lay the bacon strips over the fillets to cover completely. Do not overlap the bacon strips.
