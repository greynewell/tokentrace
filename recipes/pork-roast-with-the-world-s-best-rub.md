## Ingredients

- ½ cup brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon coarsely ground black pepper
- 1 tablespoon kosher salt
- 1 ½ teaspoons garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon dry mustard powder
- ½ teaspoon ground ginger
- ½ teaspoon onion powder
- ½ teaspoon red pepper flakes
- ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- ½ teaspoon ground cumin
- ½ teaspoon smoked paprika
- ¼ teaspoon dried thyme leaves
- 1 (2 1/2 pound) boneless pork loin roast

## Instructions

1. Mix brown sugar, pepper, salt, garlic powder, mustard powder, ground ginger, onion powder, red pepper flakes, cayenne pepper, cumin, paprika, and thyme in a bowl. Rub spice mixture over pork loin and wrap tightly in plastic wrap. Place pork on a 9x13-inch baking dish and refrigerate for 4 hours to overnight.
2. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Remove plastic wrap from pork and discard; return pork to baking dish.
