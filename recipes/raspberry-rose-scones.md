## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 6 tablespoons white sugar
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon baking soda
- 1 stick unsalted butter, frozen
- ½ cup heavy cream
- 1  egg
- 1 tablespoon rose water (such as Nielsen-Massey)
- 1 cup frozen raspberries
- 2 tablespoons heavy cream, or as needed
- 2 tablespoons raspberry-flavored sugar

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone mat or parchment paper.
2. Mix flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and baking soda together in a large bowl.
3. Grate in 1/3 of the butter using the large holes of a box grater. Toss lightly with your fingertips until coated with flour. Repeat twice more with remaining butter.
4. Whisk 1/2 cup cream, egg, and rose water together in a small bowl with a fork. Pour over the flour-butter mixture. Mix with a fork just until large clumps of dough form. Gently mix in raspberries.
5. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Bring together and gently pat into a round about 3/4-inch thick. Cut into 8 wedges with a sharp knife.
6. Arrange wedges on the baking sheet. Brush tops with 2 tablespoons cream and sprinkle with raspberry sugar.
7. Bake in the preheated oven until golden, about 15 minutes. Let cool for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.
