## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- 4  boneless pork chops
- 5  calabaza squash, halved and sliced 1/2-inch thick
- 1 cup whole kernel corn, drained
- ½ cup chopped onion
- ½ cup chopped tomatoes
- 2 teaspoons minced garlic
- 1 (6 ounce) can tomato sauce
- ½ teaspoon ground cumin
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon garlic powder
- 2 cups chicken stock, or more as needed

## Instructions

1. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook pork chops until no longer pink in the center, about 4 minutes per side. Cool until easily handled, about 5 minutes. Cut the pork into bite-sized cubes.
2. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in the saucepan. Add cubed pork, calabaza squash, corn, onion, tomatoes, and garlic and cook until onion is transparent, about 5 minutes.
