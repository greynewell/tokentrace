## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons chocolate-hazelnut spread (such as Nutella®), or more to taste
- 4 slices cinnamon bread (such as Pepperidge Farm®)
- ¼ cup milk
- 1  large egg, beaten
- ¼ teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Spread 1 tablespoon chocolate-hazelnut spread onto one side of each of 2 slices cinnamon bread; top each with another bread slice to make 2 sandwiches.
