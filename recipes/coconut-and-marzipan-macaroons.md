## Ingredients

- 5 large egg whites
- 18 ounces marzipan
- 2 cups confectioners' sugar, sifted, divided
- 2 cups dried unsweetened coconut
- ½ teaspoon lemon zest
- 2 tablespoons rum
- ½ cup white sugar
- 2 (3.5 ounce) packages dark chocolate, finely chopped

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet or line with parchment paper.
2. Beat egg whites in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl until foamy. Continue beating until stiff peaks form.
3. Combine marzipan with 1/2 of the confectioners' sugar and rub with your fingers until mixture resembles bread crumbs. Add coconut, remaining confectioners' sugar, lemon zest, and rum. Mix well. Fold in stiff egg whites.
4. Using 2 teaspoons, drop small dollops of mixture onto the prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle with sugar.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until the macaroons are golden but soft to the touch, about 20 minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack and cool completely, 30 minutes to 1 hour.
6. Place 3/4 of the chocolate in the top of a double boiler over simmering water. Stir frequently, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, until chocolate is melted, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in remaining chocolate until melted.
7. Dip 1/3 of each cooled macaroon into the melted chocolate. Set macaroons on waxed paper until chocolate has set. Store the macaroons in an airtight container, with waxed paper between the layers.
