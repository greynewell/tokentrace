## Ingredients

- 3  ripe bananas, mashed
- 3 large eggs
- ¼ cup coconut flour
- 2 tablespoons coconut flour
- 1 tablespoon stevia powder
- 1 ½ teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ⅓ cup miniature semisweet chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 10 muffin cups with paper liners.
2. Blend bananas, eggs, coconut flour, stevia, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl with a whisk or a fork. Stir in chocolate chips.
3. Pour mixture evenly between the prepared muffin cups, filling each about 1/2 inch from the top as these muffins won't rise as much as others.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes and transfer to a paper towel-lined plate; the moisture from the bananas will leak through the liners a little and this is normal.
