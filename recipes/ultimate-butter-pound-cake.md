- 1 cup white sugar
- 3 tablespoons packed light brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour
- 4  eggs

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 9x5-inch loaf pan with parchment paper, leaving an overhang over 2 sides.
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, vanilla extract, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until fluffy. Beat in flour. Beat in eggs one at a time, scraping the bowl after each addition. Pour batter into a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
