## Ingredients

- ¾ cup arrowroot starch
- ⅔ cup white rice flour
- ⅔ cup brown rice flour
- 1 tablespoon white sugar  (Optional)
- 14 tablespoons cold butter, cut into chunks
- 2 large cold eggs
- 1 tablespoon white vinegar
- 1 tablespoon cold water, or more as needed   (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Combine 3/4 cup arrowroot starch, white rice flour, brown rice flour, and sugar in a food processor; pulse until blended. Add butter to flour mixture and pulse until mixture is the consistency of oatmeal.
2. Transfer flour-butter mixture to a bowl; add eggs and vinegar. Knead mixture just until blended. Mix water, 1 tablespoon at a time, into dough (if dough is too dry) until dough holds together. Split dough into 2 balls, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate until chilled, about 1 hour.
3. Spread a piece of plastic wrap on a work surface and sprinkle with arrowroot starch. Place 1 dough ball on the plastic wrap and flatten using your hands. Dust rolling pin with more arrowroot starch and roll over dough until even in thickness and about 9 inches in diameter. Repeat with remaining dough.
