## Ingredients

- 1 cup warm milk
- 1  egg, lightly beaten
- 1  egg yolk, beaten
- 3 cups bread flour
- ½ tablespoon salt
- 3 tablespoons butter
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 3 teaspoons bread machine yeast
- 18  2 inch sausages, cut in 1/2
- 1 (16 ounce) package frozen hash brown potatoes
- 8 slices Cheddar cheese, quartered

## Instructions

1. Make the dough: Place milk, egg, egg yolk, butter, flour, salt, sugar, and yeast into a bread machine in the order listed, or follow the order recommended by your manufacturer if different. Run the Dough cycle, about 1 1/2 hours.

3. Punch down dough on a lightly floured surface and divide into 36 pieces. Roll pieces into balls. Arrange balls in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet, about 2 inches apart. Allow balls to rise, 15 to 20 minutes.
4. Flatten balls, and make a depression in the center of each. Fill each with 1 piece sausage, about 1 tablespoon potatoes, and 1 square Cheddar.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 15 to 18 minutes.
