## Ingredients

- 1 ½ tablespoons active dry yeast
- 2 ¾ cups warm water (110 degrees F)
- 3 cups whole wheat flour
- 1 cup wheat bran
- 5 cups bread flour, divided
- 1 cup wheat germ
- 1 cup dry non-fat milk powder
- ½ cup brown sugar
- ½ cup vital wheat gluten
- 2 tablespoons sesame seeds
- 1 tablespoon salt
- ¼ cup vegetable oil
- 2  eggs

## Instructions

1. In a small mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the whole wheat flour, wheat bran, 3 cups of the bread flour, wheat germ, milk powder, brown sugar, wheat gluten, sesame seeds, and salt; stir well. Mix in the yeast mixture, oil and eggs.
3. Add the remaining bread flour, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring well after each addition. When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.
4. Lightly oil a large bowl. Place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
5. Deflate the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough into three equal pieces and form into loaves. Place the loaves into three lightly greased 8x4 inch loaf pans. Cover the loaves with a damp cloth and let rise until doubled in volume, about 40 minutes.
6. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
7. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for about 30 minutes or until the top is golden brown and the bottom of the loaf sounds hollow when tapped.
