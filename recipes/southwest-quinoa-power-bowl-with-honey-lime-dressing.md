## Ingredients

- 3 cups quinoa
- 1 ½ cups water
- ¾ teaspoon adobo seasoning, or more to taste
- 1 tablespoon olive oil, or to taste
- 3 medium sweet potatoes, peeled and chopped
- ¾ cup onion, chopped
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 ½ cups canned black beans, rinsed
- 3 medium red bell peppers, sliced
- 3 medium avocados, sliced
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro, or to taste
- 9 tablespoons lime juice
- 6 tablespoons canned coconut milk
- 3 tablespoons water
- 3 tablespoons raw honey
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- ½ teaspoon salt, or more to taste

## Instructions

1. Rinse quinoa in a fine mesh strainer and place in a small pot. Add 1 1/2 cups water and bring to a boil. Add 3/4 teaspoon adobo seasoning, lower heat, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water is almost gone, about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat.
2. While the quinoa is cooking, heat 1 tablespoon oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add sweet potatoes and onion and season with salt and pepper. Add more adobo seasoning if desired. Cook over medium heat until sweet potatoes are tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from the heat.
3. Meanwhile, make dressing: whisk lime juice, coconut milk, water, honey, olive oil, and salt together in a bowl. Set aside.
4. Distribute quinoa, sweet potato-onion mixture, black beans, bell peppers, and avocados in 6 bowls. Dress with honey-lime dressing and garnish with cilantro.
