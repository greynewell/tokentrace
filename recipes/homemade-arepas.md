## Ingredients

- 2 ½ cups lukewarm water
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 cups pre-cooked white corn meal (such as P.A.N.®)
- ¼ cup vegetable oil, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Stir water and salt together in a medium bowl; gradually stir in cornmeal with your fingers until the mixture forms a soft, moist, malleable dough.
2. Form dough into eight 2-inch diameter balls; pat each ball to flatten into a 3/8-inch-thick arepa patty.
3. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat; fry arepas in batches until golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer cooked arepas to a paper towel-lined plate to drain until cool enough to handle.
4. Slice halfway through each arepa horizontally with a thin serrated knife to form a pita-like pocket.
