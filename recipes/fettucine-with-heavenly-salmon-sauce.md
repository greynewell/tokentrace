## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons butter
- 10 ounces salmon, cut into thin strips
- 1  leek, sliced
- 1  red onion, thinly sliced
- 1 clove garlic, crushed
- ¾ cup light cream
- ¾ cup sour cream
- ½ tablespoon cornstarch
- 2 tablespoons lemon zest
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ teaspoon paprika
- 8 ounces dry fettuccine noodles
- ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese

## Instructions

1. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the salmon, leek, onion, and garlic, and fry until fragrant, about 2 minutes. In a medium bowl, mix together the cream, sour cream, and cornstarch; stir into the skillet. Stir in the lemon zest, pepper, and paprika. Cook, stirring constantly, for 10 minutes, until sauce is thickened and salmon flakes easily with a fork.
