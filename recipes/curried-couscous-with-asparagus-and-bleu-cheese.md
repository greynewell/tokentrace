## Ingredients

- 2 ¾ cups water, divided
- 2 cups uncooked couscous
- ½ cup raisins
- 1 ½ tablespoons olive oil
- 1 ½ cups fresh asparagus tips and pieces
- ½ cup thinly sliced green onions
- ⅓ cup shredded carrots
- 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 1 ½ teaspoons curry powder
- 1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger root
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- 3 ounces crumbled blue cheese
- ¼ cup sunflower kernels

## Instructions

1. Bring 1 3/4 cups water to a boil in a saucepan. Slowly pour couscous and raisins into the boiling water while stirring. Place a cover on the saucepan, reduce heat to low, and simmer until the couscous absorbs most of the water, 8 to 10 minutes.
2. Remove saucepan from heat and set aside until couscous absorbs remaining water, about 5 minutes more. Fluff couscous with a fork.
3. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Saute asparagus, green onions, and carrots in hot oil until tender-crisp, about 5 minutes.
4. Mix vinegar, sugar, curry powder, ginger, and salt together in a large bowl until the sugar is completely dissolved into the vinegar; add the couscous mixture, asparagus mixture, blue cheese, and sunflower kernels. Gently fold the mixture until the kernels are evenly distributed through the mixture.
