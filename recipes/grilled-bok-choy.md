## Ingredients

- 1 (2 pound) head of bok choy
- ¼ cup melted butter
- ⅛ teaspoon garlic powder
- ⅛ teaspoon paprika
- ⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon seasoned salt (such as LAWRY'S®)
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper

## Instructions

1. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
2. Mix butter, garlic powder, paprika, and 1/8 teaspoon black pepper in a small bowl; set aside.
3. Slice the bottom off bok choy; remove and clean stalks. Sprinkle seasoned salt and remaining 1 teaspoon black pepper over both sides of stalks.
4. Place bok choy on the preheated grill. Brush with seasoned butter mixture, close the grill top, and cook until stalks show grill marks and leaves are crisp at the edges, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn bok choy, brush with butter mixture, close the top, and cook other sides, 3 to 4 more minutes. Brush with any remaining butter mixture and transfer to a platter to serve.
