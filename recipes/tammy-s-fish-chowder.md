## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 2  yellow onions, diced
- 3  ribs celery, diced
- ½ cup white wine
- 4  potatoes, chopped
- 2 cups fish stock
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme
- 1 teaspoon seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®)
- 1  bay leaf
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 cup heavy whipping cream
- 1 (4 ounce) fillet sea bass, chopped, or more to taste
- ½ teaspoon white sugar
- 3 dashes hot sauce

## Instructions

1. Heat olive oil and butter in a large stockpot over medium heat; cook and stir onions and celery in the hot oil until softened, about 5 minutes. Add wine; raise heat to medium-high and cook until wine is reduced by half, 2 to 3 minutes.
2. Mix potatoes, fish stock, thyme, seafood seasoning, bay leaf, salt, and pepper into onion mixture; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, cover stockpot, and simmer until potatoes are tender but not falling apart, 10 to 15 minutes.
3. Heat cream in a small saucepan over medium heat just until cream is steaming, about 5 minutes. Stir cream and sea bass into potato mixture; cook until sea bass is cooked through, about 10 minutes. Season chowder with sugar, hot sauce, salt, and pepper.
