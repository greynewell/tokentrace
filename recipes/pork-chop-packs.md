## Ingredients

- 2  (1 1/4 inch thick) pork chops
- 2 large sweet potatoes
- 2 slices  onion
- 2  apples - peeled, cored and sliced

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Lay out two sheets aluminum foil large enough to hold 1/2 of the the ingredients. Place a pork chop on the center of each piece. Place 1/2 of the sweet potato, 1 slice of onion, and 1/2 of the apples over each pork chop. Fold up and seal each package.
3. Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes, or until the potato is soft when pricked with a fork. Do not open packages while baking as this will allow the steam to escape and will dry out the pork chops. Also, be careful when opening as the steam can burn.
