## Ingredients

- 1  serving cooking spray  (Optional)
- 2  sweet potatoes, sliced very thinly
- 2  Yukon Gold potatoes, sliced
- 1 large onion, sliced
- 1 (2 to 3 pound) roasting chicken
- 2 tablespoons olive oil, or to taste
- 1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease the top and bottom of a broiler pan with cooking spray.
2. Layer sweet potatoes, potatoes, and onion slices in the bottom of the broiler pan.
3. Place chicken, breast side down, on a work surface. Cut along both sides of the backbone with kitchen shears from top to bottom; remove backbone. Flip chicken and splay it open. Press firmly onto breasts with your hands to break the breast-bone.
4. Brush olive oil over chicken. Season with salt and pepper. Place on the broiler pan top.
5. Roast in the preheated oven until juices run clear and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 1 hour.
6. Let cool before slicing, about 10 minutes. Serve with potato and onion mixture.
