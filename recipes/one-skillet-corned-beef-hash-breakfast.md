## Ingredients

- 1 (15 ounce) can HORMEL® Mary Kitchen® Corned Beef Hash
- ¼ cup finely diced onion
- ¼ cup finely diced green bell pepper
- 4  large eggs
- 2 tablespoons canned diced tomatoes and green chiles
- ¼ cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
- salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Combine corned beef hash, onion, and bell pepper in an ovenproof skillet. Cook, stirring occasionally, over medium-high heat until vegetables begin to soften and hash begins to brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Make 4 indentations in the hash for the eggs. Remove from heat.
2. Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
3. Carefully crack an egg into each indentation. Top with chopped tomatoes.
4. Place skillet under broiler; broil until eggs are cooked to preferred doneness, 4 to 10 minutes. Check often to avoid burning eggs. Remove skillet from oven. Top with shredded cheese; sprinkle with salt and pepper.
