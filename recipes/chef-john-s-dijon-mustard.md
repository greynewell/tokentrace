## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups white wine
- 1 cup water, or more as needed
- ⅔ cup white wine vinegar
- 1  yellow onion, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 cup whole yellow mustard seeds
- ¼ cup dry mustard
- 1 tablespoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 4  1-pint canning jars with lids and rings

## Instructions

1. Combine white wine, water, vinegar, onion, and garlic in a saucepan; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium low, and simmer until flavors combine, about 15 minutes. Cool to room temperature and pour through a strainer into a large bowl; reserve liquid and discard onions and garlic.
2. Stir mustard seeds, dry mustard, garlic powder, and salt into strained liquid; cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and let sit at room temperature until mixture thickens, 24 to 48 hours.
3. Puree mustard mixture to desired consistency using a stick blender. Transfer mustard mixture to a saucepan and add water as necessary to reach a smooth consistency. Bring mustard to a simmer, reduce heat to medium, and cook, stirring constantly, until flavors combine, about 10 minutes.
4. Pack mustard into hot, sterilized jars, filling to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids and screw on rings.
5. Refrigerate mustard until flavors blend, at least 1 week.
