## Ingredients

- 1 (9 inch) prepared pie crust
- 12 slices bacon
- 1 cup shredded Swiss cheese
- ⅓ cup minced onion
- 4  eggs, beaten
- 2 cups light cream
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon white sugar
- ⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels, then chop coarsely. Sprinkle bacon, Swiss cheese, and onion into pastry shell.
3. Whisk together eggs, cream, salt, sugar, and cayenne pepper in a medium bowl. Pour mixture into pastry shell.
4. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) and continue baking until a knife inserted 1 inch from the edge comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Allow quiche to sit 10 minutes before cutting into wedges.
