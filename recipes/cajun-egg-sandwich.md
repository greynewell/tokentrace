## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon mayonnaise
- ½ teaspoon Cajun seasoning
- 2 slices toasted whole wheat bread
- 2 ounces andouille smoked sausage, cut in half lengthwise
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1 large egg

## Instructions

1. Whisk mayonnaise and Cajun seasoning together in a small bowl until smooth. Spread over both slices of toasted bread.
2. Place andouille sausage in a skillet, cut-side down. Cook over medium-high heat for 2 minutes. Flip and cook for 2 minutes more. Transfer andouille to one slice of bread, leaving a small space in between the halves as a "raft" to hold the egg in place.
3. Heat oil in the same skillet for 1 minute over medium heat. Crack egg into the skillet and let cook undisturbed for 3 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook for 2 minutes more. Place fried egg on top of the andouille and cover with the second slice of bread.
