## Ingredients

- 1  egg
- ¾ cup milk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour
- ⅓ cup white sugar
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ⅓ cup chopped fresh lemon verbena
- ¼ cup cold butter
- 1 cup fresh blueberries

## Instructions

1. Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups, or line pan with paper muffin liners. Whisk together the egg, milk, and vanilla extract until smooth; set aside.
