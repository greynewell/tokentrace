## Ingredients

- 2 cups butter, softened
- 3 cups white sugar
- 6  eggs, room temperature
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- ¼ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 pinch ground mace
- 1 cup sour cream
- 1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9- or 10-inch fluted tube pan (such as Bundt®.
2. Beat butter and sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy and noticeably lighter in color. Add room-temperature eggs 1 at a time, allowing each egg to blend into the butter mixture before adding the next. Beat in vanilla with the last egg.
3. Mix together flour, baking soda, salt, and mace in a bowl. Add flour mixture to the butter-egg mixture alternately with sour cream, mixing until just incorporated. Transfer batter to the prepared pan and spread to smooth top.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour and 20 minutes. Cool for at least 10 minutes before inverting pan onto a cooling rack, and tapping out the cake. Dust with confectioners' sugar before serving.
