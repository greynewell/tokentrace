## Ingredients

- 12 ounces butternut squash - peeled, seeded, and cut into 1-inch pieces
- 1 small yellow onion, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
- 3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar, divided
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons vegetable oil
- kosher salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 6 ounces kale, roughly chopped
- ¼ cup vegetable broth

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Place squash into a large bowl. Add onion, 1 1/2 tablespoons vinegar, brown sugar, oil, salt, and pepper; toss to coat. Spread mixture in a single layer onto a baking sheet.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until squash is tender and golden, 30 to 40 minutes. Set aside.
