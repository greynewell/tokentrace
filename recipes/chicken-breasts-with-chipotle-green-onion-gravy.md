## Ingredients

- 2  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- salt and fresh ground pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
- ¾ cup chicken broth
- 2 tablespoons minced green onions
- ½ teaspoon chipotle chile powder, or more to taste

## Instructions

1. Place chicken breast halves between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/2-inch. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
2. Heat olive oil in a skillet on high heat until it begins to shimmer, about 1 minute. Reduce heat to medium; cook chicken breasts until browned and no longer pink inside, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer cooked chicken to a warm plate and loosely cover with aluminum foil.
3. Melt butter in the skillet; stir in flour and cook for about 2 minutes. Stir in chicken broth, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan; cook and stir until gravy begins to simmer and thicken, 1 to 2 minutes.
4. Stir in green onions and chipotle chile powder.
5. Return chicken breasts to the skillet and cook until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes.
