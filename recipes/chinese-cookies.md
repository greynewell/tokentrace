## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups white sugar
- 1 ½ cups shortening
- 1  egg
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 3 ½ cups cake flour
- 1 ¼ teaspoons baking soda
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- ½ cup ground walnuts
- 1 cup prepared chocolate fudge frosting

## Instructions

1. Cream together sugar and shortening in a medium bowl. Stir in egg and vanilla, beat until light and fluffy.
