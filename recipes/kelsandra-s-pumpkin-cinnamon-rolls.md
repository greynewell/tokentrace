## Ingredients

- ¼ cup warm water (100 degrees F/38 degrees C)
- 1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
- 1 (5 ounce) can evaporated milk
- ¾ cup white sugar
- 1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 1  egg, beaten
- 2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice
- 5 cups all-purpose flour, or more if needed
- ¼ cup melted butter
- 1 ¼ cups brown sugar, packed
- 2 tablespoons pumpkin pie spice
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- 2 tablespoons butter, melted
- 1 cup confectioners' sugar
- ¼ cup milk

## Instructions

1. Make the dough: Pour warm water into a large mixing bowl and sprinkle yeast over top. Allow to stand until yeast begins to form a creamy foam, 5 to 10 minutes.
2. Add pumpkin puree, sugar, evaporated milk, olive oil, and egg to the yeast mixture; mix until thoroughly combined. Stir in pumpkin pie spice, then mix in about 5 cups of flour, or as needed, until a stiff dough forms.
3. Turn dough out onto a floured work surface and knead until smooth and elastic, but still slightly sticky, about 8 minutes. Form dough into a ball, then place in an oiled bowl, cover with a cloth, and let rise in a warm place for about 45 minutes. (The dough will rise, but it won't double.)
4. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
5. Punch down the dough, then roll it out on a floured work surface to an 18x26-inch rectangle. Brush the top with melted butter.
6. Make the filling: Mix together brown sugar and pumpkin pie spice in a small bowl; sprinkle evenly over the buttered dough. Start at the longer edge and roll dough over filling into a log. Pinch the seam closed, then use a serrated knife to cut the log into 12 equal rolls. Transfer rolls to the prepared baking dish with the cut-sides facing up.
7. Bake in the preheated oven until light golden brown on the edges, 30 to 40 minutes.
8. While the rolls are baking, make the glaze: Beat confectioners' sugar, milk, butter, cream cheese, and vanilla in a bowl until well combined.
9. Remove pumpkin rolls from the oven and immediately spread glaze over top.
