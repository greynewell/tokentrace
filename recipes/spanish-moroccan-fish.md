## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1  onion, chopped
- 1 clove garlic, finely chopped
- 1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo beans, drained and rinsed
- 2  red bell peppers, seeded and sliced into strips
- 1 large carrot, thinly sliced
- 3  tomatoes, chopped
- 4  olives, chopped
- ¼ cup chopped fresh parsley
- ¼ cup ground cumin
- 3 tablespoons paprika
- 2 tablespoons chicken bouillon granules
- 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- salt to taste
- 5 pounds tilapia fillets

## Instructions

1. Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in onion and garlic; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garbanzo beans, bell peppers, carrots, tomatoes, and olives; continue to cook until the peppers are slightly tender, about 5 minutes more.
2. Sprinkle parsley, cumin, paprika, chicken bouillon, and cayenne over the vegetables. Season with salt. Stir to incorporate.
