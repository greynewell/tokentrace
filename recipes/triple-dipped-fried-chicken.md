## Ingredients

- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ tablespoons garlic salt
- 1 tablespoon ground black pepper
- 1 tablespoon paprika
- ½ teaspoon poultry seasoning
- 1 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 2  egg yolks, beaten
- 1 ½ cups beer or water
- 1 quart vegetable oil for frying
- 1 (3 pound) whole chicken, cut into pieces

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a deep fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Mix 3 cups flour, garlic salt, 1 tablespoon pepper, paprika, and poultry seasoning together in a medium bowl.
3. Stir 1 1/2 cups beer, remaining 1 1/3 cups flour, egg yolks, salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper together in a separate bowl; thin with more beer if batter is too thick.
4. Moisten chicken pieces with a little water, then dip in seasoned flour mixture. Shake off excess and dip in beer batter, then dip in the seasoned flour mixture once more.
5. Lower chicken pieces carefully into the hot oil in batches. Fry until crispy and well-browned, about 15 to 18 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.
