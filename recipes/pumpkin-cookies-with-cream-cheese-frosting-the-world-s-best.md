## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ½ teaspoon ground ginger
- 1 cup butter
- ¾ cup white sugar
- ¾ cup brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1  egg
- 1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
- 1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- ¼ cup butter, softened
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 cups confectioners' sugar

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease two baking sheets.
2. Make cookies: Whisk flour, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda, nutmeg, and ginger together in a bowl.
3. Beat butter, both sugars, egg, and vanilla with an electric mixer in a separate large bowl until smooth. Beat in pumpkin puree. Gradually stir dry ingredients into pumpkin mixture until combined; batter will be moist.
4. Drop teaspoonfuls of batter about 2 inches apart onto the prepared baking sheets.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes, switching racks halfway through.
6. Remove from the oven and let cool on the sheets for 5 minutes. Transfer cookies to a wire rack and cool completely, about 25 minutes.
7. While the cookies are cooling, make frosting: Beat cream cheese, butter, and vanilla in a bowl with an electric mixer until soft and creamy. Beat in powdered sugar, about 1/2 cup at a time, until frosting is smooth and spreadable.
8. Spread frosting over cooled cookies.
