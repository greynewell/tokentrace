## Ingredients

- 1 ¼ cups dry white wine (such as Sauvignon Blanc)
- 1 tablespoon cherry brandy
- 1 clove garlic, slightly crushed
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper
- 1 pinch freshly grated nutmeg
- 4 teaspoons cornstarch
- 8 ounces shredded Gruyere cheese
- 8 ounces shredded Emmentaler cheese

## Instructions

1. Add white wine, cherry brandy, garlic clove, cayenne, nutmeg, and cornstarch to a saucepan. Whisk to combine and place on the stove over medium heat. Cook, whisking occasionally, until mixture thickens slightly and you can see wisps of steam in the pan, 3 to 5 minutes.
2. Add Gruyere and Emmentaler cheeses, one handful at a time, slowly whisking after each addition until melted. Continue whisking until all cheese is melted and sauce is very smooth. Remove from the heat and transfer into a fondue pot to serve.
3. Keep sauce warm while serving so it doesn't solidify.
