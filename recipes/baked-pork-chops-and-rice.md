## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1  onion, diced
- 1 pinch seasoned salt, or to taste
- 6  thin bone-in pork chops
- 1 (14 ounce) can beef consomme
- 10 fluid ounces water
- 1 ½ cups white rice

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer onion to a plate.
3. Sprinkle seasoned salt over all sides of each pork chop. Place pork chops in the same large skillet and cook until browned, 1 to 2 minutes per side.
4. Mix beef consomme and water together in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Pour rice into the broth mixture; add caramelized onion. Gently arrange pork chops over rice in a single layer. Cover baking dish with aluminum foil.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until pork is cooked through, 45 to 60 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
