## Ingredients

- 1 pint fresh strawberries
- ⅓ cup white sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla

## Instructions

1. Combine strawberries, sugar, and vanilla in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until mixture sizzles and juice begins to form.
2. Continue stirring; mash a few strawberries with a wooden spoon or heat-proof spatula to help produce the syrup. Cook until sauce thickens, about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat.
3. Transfer 1/3 of the strawberry sauce to a blender. Cover and hold the lid down with a potholder while you puree the mixture.
4. Add pureed mixture back into the remaining sauce and stir until blended.
