## Ingredients

- 2 cups oil for frying
- 4 cups all-purpose flour
- 3 tablespoons baking powder
- 2 tablespoons salt
- 2 ½ cups warm milk

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl; mix in milk to form a soft dough. Divide dough into eighteen 2-inch diameter balls; flatten or roll each ball into 1/2-inch-thick rounds.
