## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups graham cracker crumbs
- 3 tablespoons butter, melted
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese (such as Philadelphia®), softened
- 1 cup white sugar
- 3  eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 (16 ounce) carton sour cream
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Combine graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, and 2 tablespoons sugar in a bowl. Mix until evenly moistened; press into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan and place in the refrigerator.
3. Beat cream cheese in a large bowl with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Add 1 cup sugar and beat until combined. Add eggs and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract; beat on high speed until creamy, about 1 minute. Pour cream cheese mixture into the chilled cracker crust and spread to evenly cover crust.
4. Pour enough water into a rimmed baking sheet to cover the bottom, and place the springform pan on top.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven and increase oven temperature to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).
6. Just before cheesecake finishes baking, combine sour cream, 2 tablespoons sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract in a bowl for the topping. Spread evenly on top of the cheesecake.
7. Return to the oven and bake for 5 minutes. Set the pan on a wire rack, and allow the cheesecake to cool at room temperature, about 1 hour. Refrigerate until completely chilled, about 4 hours, before serving.
