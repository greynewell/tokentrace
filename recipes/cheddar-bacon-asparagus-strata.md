## Ingredients

- 1 pound bacon
- 1 pound fresh asparagus, trimmed
- 8  eggs
- 2 cups milk
- ¼ teaspoon dry mustard powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ⅛ teaspoon pepper
- 1 (1 pound) loaf sliced bread, crusts removed
- 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
- ¼ cup diced onion
- ½  red bell pepper, diced
- 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

## Instructions

1. Cook the bacon in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat until evenly browned, about 10 minutes.
2. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate.
3. Crumble the bacon and set aside.
4. Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer.
5. Cover and bring the water to a boil.
6. Add the asparagus, cover, and steam until bright green but still crunchy, about 5 minutes.
7. Remove asparagus and set aside.
8. In a large bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, dry mustard, salt, and pepper until smooth and well combined.
9. Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
10. Layer the bread slices into the bottom of the dish, cutting and fitting extra slices as needed to fill spaces.
11. Sprinkle 1 cup of Cheddar cheese over the bread, followed by the diced onion.
12. Arrange asparagus spears and red bell pepper in a layer over the onion.
13. Sprinkle crumbled bacon over the red bell pepper; top with another layer of bread slices, cutting and filling in spaces as before.
14. Pour the egg-milk mixture evenly over the casserole, and refrigerate overnight.
15. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
16. Bake the casserole for 50 minutes; sprinkle 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese over the top of the casserole, return to the oven, and bake until the cheese is melted and bubbling and a knife inserted into the center of the casserole comes out clean, 10 to 15 more minutes.
