## Ingredients

- 1 ¼ cups packed brown sugar
- ¼ cup shortening
- 1  egg
- ¼ cup milk
- 1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 ½ teaspoons baking soda
- 1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 1 cup unsulfured molasses
- 6 cups all-purpose flour
- 1  egg, beaten

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line cookie sheets with parchment paper.
2. In a large bowl, cream together brown sugar and shortening until smooth. Mix in 1 egg, milk, and vanilla until smooth. Stir in the baking soda, cinnamon, and molasses. Mix in flour until the dough is stiff enough to roll out.
