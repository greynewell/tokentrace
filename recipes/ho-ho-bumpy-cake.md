## Ingredients

- 1 dash all-purpose flour
- 1 (15.25 ounce) package devil's food cake mix (such as Duncan Hines®)
- 1 cup water
- 3  eggs
- ⅓ cup vegetable oil
- ¾ cup white sugar
- ⅔ cup shortening
- 1 (5 ounce) can evaporated milk
- ½ cup butter
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 pinch salt
- 1 (16 ounce) can dark chocolate frosting

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 15x10-inch jelly roll pan.
2. Combine cake mix, water, eggs, and oil in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer on low speed until moistened. Increase speed to medium and beat for 2 minutes. Pour batter into the prepared pan.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 24 to 29 minutes. Let cool completely, at least 45 minutes.
4. Combine sugar, shortening, evaporated milk, butter, vanilla extract, and salt in a bowl. Beat with a hand mixer until light and fluffy, 10 to 15 minutes. Pipe cream frosting in lines over the cooled cake.
5. Place chocolate frosting in a microwave-safe bowl. Warm in the microwave for 1 minute, checking after 30 seconds. Drizzle melted frosting over the cream with a spoon. Refrigerate until set, about 1 hour.
