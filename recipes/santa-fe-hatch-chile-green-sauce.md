## Ingredients

- 6 ounces Hatch chile peppers, halved and seeded
- 3 tablespoons corn oil
- 1 cup chopped onion
- 2 teaspoons minced garlic
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 2 cups beef broth
- 1 teaspoon salt

## Instructions

1. Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
