## Ingredients

- 3 large  fresh peaches - peeled, pitted, and sliced
- ½ cup water
- ½ cup white sugar
- ½ cup brown sugar
- 4 tablespoons salted butter
- 2 tablespoons vodka
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon almond extract
- 1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ¾ cup brown sugar
- ¾ cup salted butter, softened
- 3 large  fresh peaches - peeled, pitted, and sliced
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 6 large eggs
- 1 cup salted butter, softened
- ¾ cup buttermilk
- ½ cup sour cream
- ½ cup butter-flavored shortening
- 2 teaspoons almond extract
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 3 cups white sugar
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon baking powder

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a fluted tube pan (such as Bundt).
2. Combine peaches, water, white sugar, brown sugar, butter, vodka, cinnamon, vanilla extract, almond extract, and nutmeg in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook down until filling has a cobbler-like texture, about 25 minutes.
3. Mix brown sugar and butter for topping together in a bowl and spread evenly in the prepared cake pan. Combine sliced peaches and cinnamon and arrange neatly on top of brown sugar and butter mixture.
4. Combine eggs, butter, buttermilk, sour cream, shortening, almond extract, and vanilla extract in a bowl and mix very well.
5. Combine flour, sugar, cinnamon, and baking powder in another bowl. Mix into wet ingredients until combined. Pour 1/2 of the batter into the prepared cake pan. Pour filling on top; pour remaining cake batter on top.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Continue baking until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Invert onto a cake plate and let cool.
