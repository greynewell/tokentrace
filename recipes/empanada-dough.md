## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ⅓ cup white sugar
- 1  egg yolk
- ½ cup water
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour for dusting
- 2 tablespoons melted butter for brushing

## Instructions

1. Whisk together the 2 cups flour, salt, and sugar in a bowl until evenly blended; make a well in the center of the mixture. Whisk the egg yolk and water together in a small bowl until smooth; pour into the well and mix to form a stiff dough. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.
2. Roll the dough with a rolling pin until thin, sprinkling with flour to prevent from sticking. Brush with melted butter and roll it like a jelly roll. Cut with a sharp knife into 1 1/2-inch slices. Roll each piece into a circle and fill with about 1 tablespoon filling. Fold over into half moons and seal.
