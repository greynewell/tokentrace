## Ingredients

- 2 cups white flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 2 cups buttermilk
- 3  eggs, separated

## Instructions

1. Sift the flour, salt, and baking soda together in a bowl. Add the buttermilk and egg yolks; stir until you have a batter.
2. In a separate large glass or metal mixing bowl, beat the egg whites until foamy until soft peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites will form soft mounds rather than a sharp peak. Fold the egg whites into the prepared batter.
3. Place an aebleskiver pan over medium heat; prepare each cup with cooking spray. Pour the batter into each cup to about 2/3 full. Cook until golden brown on each side, using a toothpick to flip, 1 to 2 minutes per side.
