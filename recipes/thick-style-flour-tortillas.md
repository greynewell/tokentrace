## Ingredients

- 4 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 ¼ cups warm water, or more as needed
- ¼ cup canola oil

## Instructions

1. Mix flour, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl.
2. Combine water and canola oil in a separate bowl. Mix into the flour mixture with a fork until dough forms a ball, adding 1/4 cup water if dough is too dry.
3. Knead dough until smooth, 3 to 4 minutes. Divide into 14 egg-size balls. Cover bowl with a cotton towel. Let dough rest for 10 to 15 minutes.
4. Roll 1 ball dough into an 8-inch tortilla on a floured work surface. Repeat with remaining dough.
5. Preheat an ungreased cast iron griddle on medium-high heat. Place 1 tortilla on the hot griddle; cook until browned spots form, about 1 minute per side. Transfer to a plate; cover with a cotton towel to keep warm. Repeat with remaining tortillas, stacking them under the towel.
