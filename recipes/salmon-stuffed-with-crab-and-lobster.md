## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 2 small lemons
- 1 tablespoon salted butter
- ½ medium onion, diced
- 2 cloves garlic, diced
- ½ pound crabmeat, coarsely chopped
- ½ pound lobster meat, chopped
- 6 ounces goat cheese, crumbled
- 2 (8 ounce) salmon fillets
- 2 tablespoons barbecue sauce, or to taste
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a baking dish with cooking spray. Slice one lemon and juice the second lemon; set aside.
2. Melt butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; saute until golden brown 7 to 8 minutes. Remove from the heat.
3. Chop crab and lobster in a food processor. Transfer into a bowl and mix in onion mixture, goat cheese, and lemon juice.
4. Cut each salmon piece in half. Fold crab and lobster stuffing into each piece and tie closed with kitchen string. Place in the prepared baking dish. Place lemon slices on top of salmon and cover with barbecue sauce.
5. Cover the baking dish and bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Uncover and bake until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 15 more minutes.
