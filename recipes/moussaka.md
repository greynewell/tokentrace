## Ingredients

- 3  eggplants, peeled and cut lengthwise into 1/2 inch thick slices
- salt
- ¼ cup olive oil
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1 pound lean ground beef
- salt to taste
- ground black pepper to taste
- 2  onions, chopped
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- ¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ½ teaspoon fines herbs
- 2 tablespoons dried parsley
- 1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
- ½ cup red wine
- 1  egg, beaten
- 4 cups milk
- ½ cup butter
- 6 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- salt to taste
- ground white pepper, to taste
- 1 ½ cups freshly grated Parmesan cheese
- ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg

## Instructions

1. Lay eggplant slices on paper towels; sprinkle lightly with salt. Let sit for 30 minutes to draw out moisture, then pat dry with paper towels.
2. Warm olive oil in a skillet over high heat. Fry eggplant until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels; set aside.
3. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in ground beef, onions, and garlic; season with salt and black pepper. Cook and stir until beef is browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Add parsley, fines herbs, cinnamon, and 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg. Pour in tomato sauce and wine; mix well. Simmer for 20 minutes. Allow to cool, then stir in beaten egg.
4. Scald milk in a saucepan over medium heat.
5. At the same time, melt 1/2 cup butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Whisk flour into butter until smooth. Lower heat; gradually pour in scalded milk, whisking constantly until it thickens. Season béchamel sauce with salt and white pepper.
6. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
7. Arrange a single layer of eggplant in the prepared baking dish. Cover eggplant with meat sauce, then sprinkle 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese on top. Cover with remaining eggplant and sprinkle another 1/2 cup cheese on top. Pour béchamel sauce on top and sprinkle with remaining 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg. Cover with remaining cheese.
8. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and browned, about 1 hour.
