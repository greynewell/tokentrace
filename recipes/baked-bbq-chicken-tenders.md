## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- ⅓ cup barbeque sauce (such as Sweet Baby Ray's® Hickory & Brown Sugar)
- 1 ½ tablespoons Asian-flavored barbeque seasoning (such as Savory Spice® Asian Delight BBQ Rub)
- 1 tablespoon caramel sauce
- 1 pound chicken tenders

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray an 8x8-inch casserole dish with cooking spray.
2. Stir together barbeque sauce, barbeque seasoning, and caramel sauce in a shallow dish until combined. Reserve 2 tablespoons mixture for basting.
3. Dip each chicken tender into barbeque sauce mixture; coat thoroughly. Place in the prepared casserole dish.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 25 minutes. Baste with reserved sauce and bake 5 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
