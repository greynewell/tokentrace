## Ingredients

- 5 large eggs, at room temperature
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
- 2 cups whole milk, at room temperature
- ¼ cup vegetable oil
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, softened
- nonstick vegetable oil cooking spray
- ½ cup crumbled blue cheese, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Whisk eggs, salt, cayenne, milk, oil, and flour together in a large measuring cup or mixing bowl just until blended.
2. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and allow to rest for 1 hour on the counter, or in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 hours, up to overnight.
3. Grease 14 nonstick muffin cups with butter, and then mist with cooking spray.
4. Whisk the batter for a few seconds and fill each prepared muffin cup 4/5 full. Sprinkle each evenly with blue cheese.
5. Place the muffin pans into a cold oven with a drip pan set underneath. Set the heat to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Bake in the oven until popovers are well browned and fully puffed, about 30 to 35 minutes. Poke each popover with a knife to allow steam to escape. Serve hot.
