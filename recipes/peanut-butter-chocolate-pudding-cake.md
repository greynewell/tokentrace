## Ingredients

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- ¾ cup firmly packed brown sugar
- ⅓ cup peanut butter
- 2 tablespoons canola oil
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon pure vanilla extract  (Optional)
- ⅜ teaspoon fine salt
- ½ cup whole milk
- 1 ½ cups water
- ⅓ cup white sugar
- 1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder
- ½ teaspoon pure vanilla extract  (Optional)
- 1 pinch salt

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a 1 1/2- to 2-quart baking dish. Set aside.
2. Combine flour, brown sugar, peanut butter, canola oil, baking powder, vanilla extract, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Beat using a hand mixer on medium speed to incorporate ingredients, about 30 seconds. Beat in milk slowly and mix for 1 1/2 minutes more. Spread batter evenly into the prepared dish using a rubber spatula. Place the dish onto a larger baking pan with sides at least 1/4-inch deep to catch potential spills.
3. Microwave water in a microwave-safe measuring cup until boiling, 2 to 3 minutes. Add sugar, cocoa, vanilla extract, and salt; stir until sugar and cocoa have dissolved. Pour onto top of cake batter; do not stir. Carefully place into the oven.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until cake is set and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Remove carefully from the oven and place onto a cooling rack to cool and thicken up, at least 20 minutes, before spooning out.
