## Instructions

1. In a small bowl, mix together the mayonnaise, 4 cloves of garlic, 1 teaspoon of saffron powder, bread crumbs, and red pepper flakes.
2. Set aside.
3. Preheat the oven broiler.
4. Arrange the baguette slices on a baking sheet.
5. Place under the broiler for a few minutes to toast.

8. Add 4 cloves of garlic, onion, and leek; saute for a few minutes until tender.
9. Add a pinch of saffron and the bay leaf.
10. Pour in the white and red wines, then place the fish in the pan, and pour in enough water to cover the fish just barely.
11. Simmer for about 10 minutes, turning the fish carefully as needed, until the fish flakes easily with a fork.
12. Remove the fish from the broth with a slotted spoon, and set aside.
13. Pour in the beef broth, and simmer uncovered for about 10 minutes to burn off some of the alcohol, and reduce the broth.
