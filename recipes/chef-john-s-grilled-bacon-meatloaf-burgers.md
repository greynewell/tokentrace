## Ingredients

- 1  large egg, beaten
- 1 tablespoon ketchup
- 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon brown sugar
- ½ teaspoon onion powder
- ¼ teaspoon garlic powder
- pinch dried thyme
- cayenne pepper to taste
- ¼ cup plain bread crumbs
- ⅔ cup chopped cooked bacon
- 1 pound ground chuck beef (85% lean)

## Instructions

1. Whisk egg, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, salt, brown sugar, onion powder, garlic powder, thyme, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl. Add breadcrumbs and chopped cooked bacon. Crumble in the ground beef. Mix with your fingers until bacon and breadcrumbs are distributed evenly.
2. Form mixture into 4 burgers with your wet hands. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled thoroughly, about 3 hours.
3. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
4. Place burgers on the grate and cook, turing occasionally, until firm and cooked to your desired doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read between 145 and 150 degrees F (63 degrees C). Let burgers rest for a few minutes before serving.
