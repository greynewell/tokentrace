## Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
- 1 teaspoon ground allspice
- 1 teaspoon packed brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- ½ teaspoon dried minced garlic
- ½ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ½ teaspoon black pepper
- ½ teaspoon ground ginger
- ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- ¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ¼ teaspoon dried thyme leaves
- 1 (2 to 3 pound) whole chicken, cut into pieces
- ¼ cup vegetable oil

## Instructions

1. Make the jerk rub by combining salt, allspice, brown sugar, onion powder, garlic, nutmeg, black pepper, ginger, cayenne pepper, cinnamon, and thyme in a bowl. Toss chicken pieces with the spice mixture, then cover, and marinate in the refrigerator, 2 to 4 hours.
2. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Pour vegetable oil into a 9x13-inch baking dish.
3. Place chicken pieces skin-side up into the baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until juices run clear and chicken is no longer pink near the bone, 1 hour 20 minutes.
4. Turn the oven on to broil, and cook until the skin crisps, 2 to 5 minutes.
