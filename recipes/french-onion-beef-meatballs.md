## Ingredients

- 1 pound ground beef
- 1 cup dry bread crumbs
- 1 small finely chopped onion
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic
- 1 (1 ounce) package dry French onion soup mix
- 2 large eggs
- ½ cup Italian dressing
- 1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Combine beef, bread crumbs, onion, garlic, and soup mix in a large bowl. Knead the mixture with your hands until well blended; it will be quite dry. Add eggs and Italian dressing and mix. Allow mixture to sit in the refrigerator 10 minutes.
2. Pinch off just enough of the meatball mixture to fit comfortably inside your palm, then roll to form a ball. Repeat with the remaining mixture.
3. Cover the bottom of a skillet lightly with olive oil and heat to medium-high. Add meatballs. Cook on one side for about 4 minutes, then turn and continue to cook until browned and no longer pink in the centers, about 4 minutes more. You may need to cook these in batches depending on how large your skillet is.
