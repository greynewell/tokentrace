## Ingredients

- 1 ½ (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
- 1 cup crumbled blue cheese
- 1  egg
- 2 cups bread crumbs
- 2  skinless, boneless chicken breasts, halved and pounded into 1/2-inch thickness
- 3 cups cooked white rice

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Stir cream cheese and blue cheese together in a bowl. Beat egg in a separate bowl. Pour bread crumbs into a third shallow bowl.
3. Spread cheese mixture over each chicken piece. Roll each piece of chicken around filling; dip into egg and press into bread crumbs until coated. Arrange chicken rolls on a baking sheet or baking pan.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 20 to 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Cheese mixture will start to run out when done. Serve chicken over cooked rice.
