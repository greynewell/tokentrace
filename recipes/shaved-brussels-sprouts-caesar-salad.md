## Ingredients

- ½  baguette, cut into cubes, divided
- 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 8 slices bacon, divided
- 2  anchovy fillets
- 6 cloves garlic, finely minced or grated
- 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
- ½ cup mayonnaise
- 1 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, divided
- 2  lemons, juiced
- ¼ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Toss baguette cubes with olive oil, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper, in a large bowl. Place on a baking sheet.
3. Place a wire cooling rack on a separate baking sheet; lay bacon slices on top.
