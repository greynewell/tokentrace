## Ingredients

- oil for frying
- ½ (8 ounce) package cream cheese, at room temperature
- 9 tablespoons white sugar, divided
- 2 tablespoons ground cinnamon, divided
- ¼ (16 ounce) package wonton wrappers, at room temperature

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Mix cream cheese, 8 tablespoons sugar, and 1 tablespoon cinnamon in a bowl until well blended. Spoon 1 teaspoonful of the filling into each wonton wrapper. Fold the wonton like a triangle and seal 2 edges together with water; squeeze the sides together to lock out the air. Wet the ends of the triangle; fold into the center 1 at a time.
3. Place the filled wontons carefully into the oil; cook until golden brown on 1 side, about 2 minutes. Turn wontons over and cook until the other side is golden brown, about 2 minutes.
4. Mix 1 tablespoon cinnamon and 1 tablespoon sugar in a small bowl. Sprinkle on top of fried wontons.
