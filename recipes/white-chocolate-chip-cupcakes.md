## Ingredients

- ½ cup white sugar
- 2 large eggs, room temperature
- ¼ cup whole milk
- 1 cup white chocolate chips
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 cup all-purpose flour, sifted
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ½ cup unsalted butter, melted

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 10 cups of a muffin tin with paper liners.
2. Place sugar and eggs into the bowl of a stand mixer and beat using the paddle attachment until fluffy and pale yellow in color.
3. Heat milk in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring just to a boil and add white chocolate chips. Whisk until smooth. Pour mixture over sugar mixture and beat for 1 minute. Add vanilla extract and mix until combined. Fold in flour and baking powder using a rubber spoon until just incorporated, being careful not to overmix. Fold in melted butter.
4. Fill each prepared muffin cup 2/3-full with batter.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until cupcakes have risen and are just firm to the touch, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and transfer to a wire rack to cool.
