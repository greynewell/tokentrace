## Ingredients

- 1 pound broccoli crowns, cut into small pieces
- ½ pound cauliflower, broken into small florets
- ¼ cup butter
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 ¼ cups half-and-half
- ½ teaspoon Dijon mustard
- ⅔ cup grated Cheddar cheese
- ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- .063 teaspoon paprika
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 3 tablespoons grated Cheddar cheese
- 2 tablespoons bread crumbs

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add broccoli and cauliflower; cook, uncovered, until tender yet firm to the bite, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain in a colander and immediately immerse in ice water for several minutes to stop the cooking process. Drain and transfer to a baking dish.
2. While the broccoli and cauliflower are cooking, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add flour and stir until browned and bubbling, 3 to 4 minutes. Whisk in half-and-half and mustard; bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until sauce thickens, about 2 minutes.
3. Stir 2/3 cup Cheddar cheese, Parmesan cheese, and paprika into sauce; cook and stir until both cheeses are melted. Season with salt and pepper.
4. Pour sauce over broccoli and cauliflower in the baking dish; sprinkle 3 tablespoons Cheddar cheese and bread crumbs over top.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until topping is lightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes.
