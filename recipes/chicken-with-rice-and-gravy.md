## Ingredients

- 2 cups long-grain white rice
- 4 cups water
- 4  boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 3 tablespoons butter
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon ground paprika
- ¼ teaspoon dried thyme
- ¾ cup cold water
- ¼ teaspoon salt

## Instructions

1. Make the rice: Combine rice and water in a saucepan over medium-high heat; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender, about 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and keep warm.
2. While the rice is cooking, prepare the chicken: Whisk together flour, salt, pepper, paprika, and thyme in a medium bowl. Dip chicken breasts in the flour mixture, turning several times until well coated. Reserve 2 tablespoons of the flour mixture for the gravy.
3. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Place coated chicken in the skillet, and cook until chicken is golden brown and the juices run clear, about 10 minutes per side. Use tongs to transfer chicken to a plate, leaving any drippings in the skillet.
4. Make the gravy: Whisk together 3/4 cup water, the reserved 2 tablespoons flour mixture, and salt in a bowl. Pour into the skillet and whisk with the drippings, scraping any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until thick and bubbly. Add additional water 1 tablespoon at a time if the gravy is too thick.
5. Serve chicken with warm rice. Ladle gravy over top.
