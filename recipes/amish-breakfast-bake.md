## Ingredients

- 1 large Anaheim chile pepper
- 2 (12 ounce) packages reduced fat pork sausage (such as Jimmy Dean®)
- 1 cup chopped sweet onion
- 1 cup chopped zucchini
- 1 cup chopped bell pepper

- 1 (2 pound) package frozen southwestern-style hash brown potatoes, thawed
- 3 cups shredded reduced-fat Cheddar cheese

## Instructions

1. Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.

3. Cut the Anaheim pepper into halves lengthwise; remove and discard the stem, seeds, and ribs.

12. Return skillet to medium-high heat.
13. Saute onion, zucchini, bell pepper, and Anaheim pepper in hot skillet until just tender, about 4 minutes.
14. Stir eggs, hash browns, Cheddar cheese, cottage cheese, and Swiss cheese together in a large bowl; add sausage and sauteed vegetables and stir.
