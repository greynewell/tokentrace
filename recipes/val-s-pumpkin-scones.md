## Ingredients

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 cup whole wheat flour
- ½ cup packed brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ¾ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ¼ teaspoon ground allspice
- ¼ cup butter
- ½ cup raisins
- 1 cup canned pumpkin
- 1  egg
- 2 tablespoons buttermilk
- 1  egg white, beaten  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Combine all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, salt, nutmeg, and allspice in a large bowl. Cut butter into flour mixture using a pastry blender or 2 knives until mixture is crumbly. Stir raisins into flour mixture.
