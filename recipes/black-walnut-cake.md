## Ingredients

- 1 cup butter, softened
- ½ cup shortening
- 3 cups sugar
- 5  eggs
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 cup milk
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- ½ cup chopped black walnuts

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 inch tube pan.
2. In a large bowl, cream together the butter, shortening, and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing just until the yellow disappears. Combine the flour, baking powder, and cinnamon; stir into the creamed mixture alternately with the milk. Stir in the vanilla and walnuts, and pour into the prepared pan.
