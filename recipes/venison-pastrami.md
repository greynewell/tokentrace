## Ingredients

- 5 tablespoons sugar-based curing mixture (such as Morton® Quick Cure®)
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar, or as needed
- 1 tablespoon coarsely ground black pepper, or as needed
- 1 tablespoon paprika
- 1 tablespoon crushed bay leaf
- 1 teaspoon ground allspice
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- 5 pounds venison rump roast

## Instructions

1. Whisk together curing mixture, brown sugar, pepper, paprika, bay leaf, allspice, and garlic powder in a bowl. Rub mixture over venison roast, and wrap tightly in plastic wrap. Place roast in a bowl; refrigerate for 5 days.
2. Remove roast from the refrigerator and rinse thoroughly to remove the curing mixture. Place in a bowl with water to cover, and soak, refrigerated, for 2 hours. Drain.
3. Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).
4. Season roast with additional black pepper and brown sugar, and place in a roasting pan.
5. Bake, uncovered, in the preheated oven until a meat thermometer inserted near the center reads 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), about 2 hours.
