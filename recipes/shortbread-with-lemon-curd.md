## Ingredients

- 18 ounces all-purpose flour
- 5 ounces confectioners' sugar
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 pound butter, softened
- 4  eggs
- 2 cups white sugar
- ½ cup fresh lemon juice
- ¼ cup butter, melted
- 2 tablespoons grated lemon rind

## Instructions

1. Sift flour, confectioners' sugar, and salt together in a bowl. Press softened butter into flour mixture and combine until blended. Pat stiff dough into two 9x13-inch pans forming even layers. Pierce through dough with a fork every 1/2-inch in lines parallel to the long sides of the pans; use a clean yard stick laid across the pan as a guide to make straight rows. Chill dough until firm.
2. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
3. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden, about 11 minutes. Cut into rows using fork marks, again using a yardstick as a pan guide. Cut rows into 3-inch lengths to make fingers. Cool completely in the pan.
4. Meanwhile, beat eggs in a bowl. Stir in sugar, lemon juice, melted butter, and lemon rind. Pour into the top of a double boiler set over simmering water; cook and stir until thick and smooth, 5 to 10 minutes. Cool at room temperature.
5. Serve shortbread fingers with lemon curd.
