## Ingredients

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- ½ cup light brown sugar
- ½ cup white sugar
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1 pinch salt
- ½ cup butter, cut into pieces
- 1 cup chopped walnuts
- ⅓ cup white sugar, or to taste
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- ½ teaspoon ground ginger
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 6 cups apples - peeled, cored and chopped
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice

## Instructions

1. Mix flour, brown sugar, 1/2 cup of white sugar, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt together in a bowl. Combine butter with the flour mixture using fingers or a fork until coarse crumbs form. Stir in walnuts and set aside.
2. Whisk together 1/3 cup sugar, cornstarch, ginger, and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. Place the apples in a slow cooker, stir in the cornstarch mixture; toss with lemon juice.
