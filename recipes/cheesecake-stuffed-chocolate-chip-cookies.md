## Ingredients

- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, at room temperature
- ½ cup powdered sugar
- ¾ cup salted butter, softened
- ¾ cup white sugar
- ¾ cup firmly packed light brown sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- 1 (12 ounce) package semisweet chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 3 baking sheets with parchment paper.
2. Beat cream cheese and powdered sugar together in a small bowl using an electric mixer on medium-high speed until thoroughly combined. Chill filling until ready to use.
3. Beat butter, white sugar, and brown sugar in a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment on medium speed until creamy, 1 to 2 minutes. Add eggs and vanilla extract, beating until blended, about 30 seconds.
4. Stir 2 1/4 cups plus 2 tablespoons flour, baking soda, and salt together in a small bowl; gradually add to butter mixture, beating on low speed, until just blended. Beat in chocolate chips until just combined. Refrigerate dough until chilled, about 30 minutes.
5. Use a 2-tablespoon cookie scoop to place 8 scoops of the cookie dough on one of the prepared baking sheets, spaced 3 inches apart. Gently flatten each scoop to about 3 inches in diameter. Drop 2 teaspoonfuls of the cream cheese filling in the center of each cookie. Gently wrap the dough around the cream cheese and shape into a ball; press the cookies down slightly. Keep remaining dough and filling chilled.
6. Bake the first batch in the preheated oven until golden and set around the edges, 12 to 14 minutes. Let cookies cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes. Transfer cookies to wire racks; let cool completely, about 15 minutes. Repeat with remaining dough and cream cheese mixture.
