## Ingredients

- 1 (3.5 pound) boneless pork loin roast
- 2 tablespoons light brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon garlic powder
- 2 ½ teaspoons seasoned salt, divided
- 2 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and cut into bite-size cubes
- 2 pounds carrot, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces
- 1 medium onion, cut into eighths
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly oil an open roasting pan and place a roasting rack inside the pan.
2. Pat the pork loin dry with paper towels.
3. Stir together brown sugar, garlic powder, and 1 1/2 teaspoons seasoned salt together in a small bowl. Rub brown sugar mixture on all sides of the pork loin. Place seasoned pork onto the rack, and center the rack inside the roasting pan.
4. Combine potatoes, carrots, and onion in a bowl. Add olive oil and remaining seasoned salt, and stir to coat vegetables evenly. Place seasoned vegetables in the roasting pan, around the rack with the pork.
5. Roast uncovered in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 90 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
6. Remove pork roast from oven, cover in foil, and allow to rest for about 10 minutes. To serve, slice across the grain in 1/2-inch slices. Serve warm with roasted vegetables.
