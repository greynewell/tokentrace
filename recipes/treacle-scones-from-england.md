## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon cream of tartar
- ½ teaspoon cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon mixed spice
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons castor sugar or superfine sugar
- 1 tablespoon dark molasses or treacle
- ½ cup milk

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Set an oven shelf in the top third of the oven for baking.
2. Sift the flour, salt, baking soda, cream of tartar, cinnamon and mixed spice into a large bowl. Rub in butter until the mixture resembles bread crumbs. In a small saucepan, gently heat the milk and stir in the sugar and treacle until dissolved. Remove from the heat and pour into the dry ingredients. Stir until it turns into a soft dough.
3. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead lightly until smooth. Use a rolling pin to roll out to 1/2 inch thickness. Cut into 2 inch circles, rerolling dough until it has all been used. Place the scones on a lightly greased or floured baking sheet.
4. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until the bottoms are lightly browned. Cool on a wire rack. Serve split. Don't use a knife to split them, rather pull them apart into two halves gently with your hands.
