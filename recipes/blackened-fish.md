## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon paprika
- 2 teaspoons dry mustard
- 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 teaspoon white pepper
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ¾ cup unsalted butter, melted
- 6 (4 ounce) fillets trout
- ¼ cup unsalted butter, melted

## Instructions

1. Mix together paprika, dry mustard, cayenne pepper, cumin, black pepper, white pepper, thyme, and salt in a small bowl.
2. Heat a heavy cast iron pan on high heat until extremely hot, about 10 minutes.
3. While the pan is heating, pour 3/4 cup melted butter into a shallow dish. Dip each fillet into butter, turning once to coat both sides. Sprinkle both sides of fillets with spice mixture; gently pat mixture onto fish.
4. Working in batches, place fillets into the hot pan without crowding. Carefully pour about 1 teaspoon melted butter over each fillet. Cook until fish has a charred bottom, about 2 minutes. Turn fillets and spoon about 1 teaspoon melted butter over each. Continue cooking until bottoms are charred, 1 to 2 minutes. Repeat with remaining fish.
