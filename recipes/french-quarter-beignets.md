## Ingredients

- 1 package active dry yeast
- ½ cup warm water (110 degrees F (43 degrees C))
- ½ cup evaporated milk
- ½ cup white sugar
- 1  egg, beaten
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- vegetable oil for frying

## Instructions

1. Dissolve yeast in warm water in a large bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.
2. Add milk, sugar, egg, oil, vanilla extract, and salt to the yeast. Vigorously beat in flour. Mix until a sticky dough forms.
3. Divide dough into quarters. Place 1 portion on a heavily floured surface. Roll to about 1/8-inch thickness using a well floured rolling pin. Cut into 2-inch squares. Repeat with remaining 3 portions.
4. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 370 degrees F (188 degrees C). Fry beignets, a few at a time, until they puff and rise to the top, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn and brown the other side, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain on paper towels.
