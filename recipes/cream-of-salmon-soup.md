## Ingredients

- 1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed
- 1  egg yolk, beaten
- 1 tablespoon sesame seeds
- 1 ½ tablespoons butter
- 1  onion, diced
- 18 ounces salmon fillets, diced
- 1 tablespoon tomato paste
- 2 ½ cups fish stock
- ½ cup dry white wine
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 1 ¼ cups heavy whipping cream

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
