## Ingredients

- 6  potatoes, peeled and cubed
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth
- 2  leeks, chopped
- 2 teaspoons margarine
- 1 ½ cups heavy whipping cream

## Instructions

1. In a medium pot over medium heat, combine the potatoes and broth and allow to simmer for 20 minutes, or until potatoes are tender.
2. In a separate skillet over medium heat, saute the leeks in the butter or margarine for 5 to 10 minutes, or until tender. Add the leeks and the cream to the potatoes and stir well. (Note: This is the point I like to take a potato masher and slightly thicken the soup.)
