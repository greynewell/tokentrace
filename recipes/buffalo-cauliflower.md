## Ingredients

- olive oil cooking spray
- ¾ cup gluten-free baking flour (such as Premium Gold® Flax and Ancient Grains All-Purpose Flour)
- 1 cup water
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder, or to taste
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 2 heads   cauliflower, cut into bite-size pieces
- 2 tablespoons butter
- ½ cup hot pepper sauce (such as Frank's RedHot®)
- 1 teaspoon honey

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet with cooking spray.
2. Whisk together water, flour, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until batter is smooth and somewhat runny. Add cauliflower pieces to batter and mix until evenly coated; spread onto the prepared baking sheet.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 20 to 25 minutes. Set aside.
4. Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Remove from heat; stir in hot pepper sauce and honey until smooth. Brush hot sauce mixture over each cauliflower piece, repeating until all is used.
