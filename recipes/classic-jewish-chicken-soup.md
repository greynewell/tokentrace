## Ingredients

- 1  whole chicken, giblets removed
- 2 large onions, chopped
- water to cover
- 2 tablespoons dried dill weed  (Optional)
- 2 tablespoons dried parsley  (Optional)
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 4 large carrots, peeled and cut into cubes
- 2  potatoes, peeled and cut into cubes
- 2  leeks, diced
- 3 stalks celery, diced
- 1 large kohlrabi bulb, peeled and diced
- 3  parsnips, peeled and cut into cubes
- 2 tablespoons chicken bouillon granules  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Put chicken in a large pot with the chopped onions. Pour enough water into the pot to cover; add dill, parsley, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer for 45 minutes.
2. Skim and discard any foam from the top of the simmering liquid. Remove chicken to a cutting board. Remove as much meat from the chicken bones as possible; cut into chunks.
3. Return the liquid to a boil. Add carrots, potatoes, leeks, celery, kohlrabi, and parsnips to the boiling liquid. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook until the vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes. Stir cooked chicken chunks and chicken bouillon into the mixture. Season again with salt and pepper. Cook until the chicken is hot, about 5 minutes.
