## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- ⅔ cup powdered sugar
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup cold salted butter, cut into small pieces
- 2 (8 ounce) packages low-fat cream cheese, at room temperature
- ½ cup white sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 (15 ounce) cans pear halves in juice, drained
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- ¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) and place a rack in the center of the oven. Spray a 10-inch springform pan with cooking spray.
2. Place flour, sugar, and salt in a food processor; pulse to blend together. Add butter and pulse until dough just begins to come together.
3. Pat the dough onto the bottom and 1 inch up the sides of the prepared pan. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate while making the filling.
4. Process cream cheese in the food processor until smooth. Add sugar and mix well. Blend in egg and vanilla extract until smooth. Spread filling over the chilled crust. Arrange pear halves on top.
5. Combine sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl; sprinkle over pears.
6. Bake tart in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Reduce temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) and bake until crust is browned and filling is almost set, 25 to 30 minutes more.
7. Cool tart for about 20 minutes on a wire rack. Run a sharp, thin knife around the edges to remove the springform ring. Cool to room temperature before serving.
