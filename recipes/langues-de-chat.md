## Ingredients

- 9 tablespoons butter, softened
- ½ cup white sugar
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 3  egg whites
- 1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 6 (1 ounce) squares semisweet chocolate, melted

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease baking sheets.
2. In a medium bowl, cream together butter and 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar until smooth. Beat in the egg whites one at a time until batter is light and fluffy. Stir in the vanilla. Mix in the flour just until blended. Dough will be a little stiff.
3. Using a cookie press or a pastry bag with a medium star tip, press dough onto prepared baking sheet into 3-inch lengths, like a ladyfinger.
4. Bake cookies in preheated oven until straw-colored, about 10 minutes. Cool on wire rack.
5. When cookies are cool, dip one end of each cookie in melted chocolate and place on wax paper until chocolate hardens. Store in a cool place.
