## Ingredients

- 1 (8 ounce) package crescent dough sheet (such as Pillsbury®)
- 4 ounces garlic and herb cream cheese spread (such as Philadelphia®)
- 1 large egg
- 1 tablespoon water
- 2 teaspoons everything bagel seasoning

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Unroll dough on a clean surface. Roll out dough, if necessary, into a 8x12-inch rectangle. Using a pizza cutter or knife, cut the dough into 6 rows by 4 rows to make 24 squares. Divide cream cheese amongst each square, placing approximately 3/4 teaspoon in the middle of each. Bring all 4 corners up over the cheese and pinch the corners together lightly; place on the prepared baking sheet.
3. Whisk together egg and water and lightly brush over each crescent bite. Sprinkle with bagel seasoning.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool slightly before eating as filling will be hot.
