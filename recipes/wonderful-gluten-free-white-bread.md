## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon active dry yeast
- 3 tablespoons white sugar
- 1 ¼ cups warm water
- 1 ⅓ cups rice flour
- ⅔ cup sorghum flour
- ½ cup potato starch
- ½ cup cornstarch
- ⅓ cup vegetable oil
- 3  eggs
- 1 tablespoon xanthan gum
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt

## Instructions

1. Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
2. Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water in a bowl. Let stand until the yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 to 10 minutes.

Combine yeast mixture, rice flour, sorghum flour, potato starch, cornstarch, vegetable oil, eggs, xanthan gum, and salt together in the bowl of a stand mixer; mix on medium speed until incorporated, about 2 minutes. Spoon dough into the prepared loaf pan. Smooth the top of dough with the back of a wet spoon.
4. Place dough in a warm place until it has risen just over the top of the loaf pan, about 1 hour.
5. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
6. Bake in the preheated oven until loaf is medium golden brown, about 25 minutes.
