## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons butter, melted
- 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns
- 4  salmon fillets
- 2 tablespoons olive oil

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Whisk together butter, lemon juice, parsley, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl. Stir in peppercorns. Dip salmon fillets, one at a time, into lemon mixture so the flesh side is coated. Place coated fillets onto a plate.
3. Heat olive oil in a large, oven-proof skillet over medium-high heat. Once oil begins to smoke, place salmon, skin-side up, into the skillet. Cook in hot oil until flesh is seared and golden brown, about 1 minute.
4. Place the skillet into the preheated oven and cook until salmon flakes easily with a fork, 10 to 12 minutes.
