## Ingredients

- 1  yellow onion, diced
- 4 thick slices cherrywood-smoked bacon, cut into 1-inch pieces
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 2 ½ pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and chopped
- 1 cup water
- 1 ½ teaspoons garlic base (such as Better Than Bouillon® Roasted Garlic Base)
- 1 ½ cups half-and-half
- ½ cup shredded Cheddar cheese
- ¼ cup sliced green onions
- ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and select Saute function. Add onion, bacon, and butter to the hot pot and saute until bacon is crispy, 5 to 8 minutes. Turn off Saute function and transfer contents to a small bowl.
2. Add potatoes, water, and garlic base to pot and close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 12 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
3. Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 15 minutes. Release remaining pressure carefully using the quick-release method, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Mash potatoes against the side of the pot, leaving some chunks if desired. Add onion-bacon mixture and half-and-half; stir to combine.
4. Ladle into soup bowls and top with green onions, Cheddar cheese, and black pepper.
