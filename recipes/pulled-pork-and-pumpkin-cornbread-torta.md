## Ingredients

- nonstick cooking spray
- 1 cup yellow cornmeal
- 1 cup bread flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg
- 1 cup solid-pack pumpkin
- ½ cup sour cream
- ½ cup packed brown sugar
- ⅓ cup vegetable oil
- 2 large eggs
- 4 cups cooked pulled pork, heated
- ½ cup toasted pepitas
- ½ cup dried cranberries
- ½ cup toasted chopped pecans
- ½ cup barbeque sauce

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray the bottom and sides of 2 nonstick, 9-inch round baking pans with cooking spray.
2. Mix cornmeal, flour, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda, salt, and nutmeg together in a large bowl until blended. Add pumpkin, sour cream, brown sugar, vegetable oil, and eggs; beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until blended and creamy, about 2 minutes.
3. Pour and evenly spoon equal portions of the batter mixture into the 2 prepared baking pans.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Place both over a wire cooling rack and let cool slightly, about 8 minutes. Carefully remove cornbread from pans and set aside.
5. Center one cornbread, top-side down, on a serving plate or platter. Spoon and evenly spread the warm pulled pork over top to cover, then carefully center the remaining cornbread on top.
6. Mix pepitas, cranberries, and pecans together in a small bowl. Spoon evenly over the top edges of the cornbread and add a little spoonful to the center. Cut the assembled torta into even slices and serve with barbeque sauce.
