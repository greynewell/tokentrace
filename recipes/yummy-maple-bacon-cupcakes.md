## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups white sugar
- ½ cup butter, softened
- 2  eggs
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1 ⅓ cups buttermilk
- ½ cup butter, softened
- ¼ cup shortening
- ½ cup maple syrup
- 1 pinch salt
- 2 ½ cups confectioners' sugar
- 6 strips cooked bacon, crumbled
- 1 teaspoon raw sugar, or as desired

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fill 48 mini muffin cups with paper liners.
2. Beat sugar and butter together in a large bowl using an electric mixer until fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in vanilla extract.
3. Combine flour, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and nutmeg in a medium bowl. Add to the sugar mixture, 1/2 cup at a time, alternating with buttermilk. Mix well after each addition. Fill muffin cups 2/3 full of batter.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean, 18 to 21 minutes. Cool completely on a wire rack before frosting, at least 20 minutes.
5. Beat butter and shortening together until fluffy to start the frosting. Beat in maple syrup and salt. Add confectioners' sugar; beat until smooth. Frost the cooled cupcakes and sprinkle bacon crumbles and raw sugar on top.
