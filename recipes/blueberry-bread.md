## Ingredients

- ½ cup boiling water
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 2 cups blueberries
- 4 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons baking powder
- 1 ½ teaspoons baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 cups white sugar
- 1 cup freshly squeezed orange juice
- 1 ½ tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
- 2 large eggs
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour

## Instructions

1. Mix boiling water and butter for bread in a small bowl; set aside until butter has melted and mixture has cooled, about 30 minutes.
2. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease two 8 1/2x4 1/2-inch loaf pans.

5. Combine sugar, flour, softened butter, and cinnamon for topping in a small bowl. Mix with a fork until combined and crumbly. Sprinkle on top of the 2 loaves.
