## Ingredients

- 3 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- 1 tablespoon active dry yeast
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 7 cups all-purpose flour

## Instructions

1. Add the sugar and yeast to the warm water and let proof.
2. Stir in 4 cups of flour and beat until smooth. Cover and let rest for 15 minutes.
3. Beat in the salt and then add enough remaining flour to make a stiff dough. Knead until as soft and smooth as a bambino's behind. Turn in a greased bowl, cover, and let rise until doubled in size. (I put it in the oven with the light on—perfect rising temperature.)
4. Once doubled, punch down and divide into three. Place back in the bowl, cover, and let rise.
5. Once doubled again, punch down and form into three fat "footballs." Grease heavy cookie sheets and sprinkle with corn meal. Place the bread on the sheets, cover with a towel, and let rise.
6. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
7. Mist loaves with water and place in the preheated oven. Bake until loaves are golden brown and sound hollow when tapped on the bottom, 25 to 30 minutes. Mist loaves with water and turn occasionally while they bake.
