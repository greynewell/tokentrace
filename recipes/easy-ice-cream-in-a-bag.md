## Ingredients

- ¼ cup milk
- ¼ cup half-and-half
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- ¼ teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 cup ice cubes, or as needed
- 3 tablespoons ice cream rock salt

## Instructions

1. Combine milk, half-and-half, sugar, and vanilla extract in a pint-size resealable plastic bag; seal tightly.
2. Put a scoop of ice, 3 tablespoons ice cream rock salt, and the bag containing the milk-cream mixture into a gallon-size resealable plastic bag; seal tightly.
