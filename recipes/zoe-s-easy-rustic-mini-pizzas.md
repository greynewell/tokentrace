## Ingredients

- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 cups warm water
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 tablespoons instant yeast
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- 1 ½ cups prepared tomato sauce
- 1 clove garlic, diced
- 2 tablespoons fresh oregano, diced
- 2 tablespoons fresh basil, diced
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 tablespoon white vinegar
- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
- 1 cup chopped fresh spinach, or to taste  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Mix flour, water, olive oil, yeast, salt, and sugar together in a large bowl. Use an ice cream scoop to place 12 balls of dough onto the prepared pan, patting down slightly; dough will be very sticky. Let sit until risen, about 30 minutes, without kneading or punching down.
2. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a baking pan. Toss an ice cube into the bottom of the oven to add some humidity.
3. Combine tomato sauce, garlic, oregano, and basil in a bowl. Add olive oil, vinegar, and sugar; stir very well.
4. Spread 1 to 2 tablespoons tomato sauce on each dough ball. Sprinkle 1 to 4 tablespoons mozzarella cheese on top and add spinach.
5. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Let cool slightly before serving.
