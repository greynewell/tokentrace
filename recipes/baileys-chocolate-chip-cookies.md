## Ingredients

- 1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¾ cup butter
- 1 ½ tablespoons Irish cream liqueur (such as Baileys®)
- ½ cup packed brown sugar
- ¼ cup sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste
- ½ cup semisweet chocolate chips
- cooking spray

## Instructions

1. Whisk flour, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl and set aside.
2. Heat butter in a small pa on low heat until melted. Remove from heat, stir in Irish cream liqueur, and let cool.
3. Combine white and brown sugar in a large bowl and pour in cooled butter and Irish cream liqueur. Beat with a hand mixer for about 1 minute. Add in egg and mix well, then add vanilla paste.
4. With the mixer on low, slowly add in mixed dry ingredients, about 1 cup at a time, until just mixed together. Fold in chocolate chips and refrigerate dough for 1 hour.
5. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray 2 baking sheets with cooking spray.
6. Using a 1 1/2 tablespoon scooper, scoop out golf-ball sized balls from the cookie dough and set onto the baking sheets, leaving room in between.
7. Bake in the preheated oven until the bottom edges are browned, 9 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and cool for 10 to 15 minutes.
