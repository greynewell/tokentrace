## Ingredients

- 12 cups grape tomatoes
- 1 (32 ounce) carton low-sodium chicken broth
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 2 teaspoons dried minced garlic
- 1 teaspoon ground white pepper
- 3 large sprigs fresh basil
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can low-sodium chicken broth
- 6 tablespoons salted butter
- 6 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
- 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Wash tomatoes thoroughly and add to an 8-quart multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®). Depending on tomato size, you may have to use a little less than 12 cups or cut some of them to fit in the pot. Add 32-ounce carton chicken broth, onion, garlic, pepper, and basil.
2. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 25 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
3. Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions for 15 minutes, then release remaining pressure carefully using the quick-release method. Unlock and remove the lid.
4. Add remaining can of chicken broth and switch to the Saute function. Cook, stirring as needed, until soup has reduced and thickened, about 30 minutes. Use an immersion blender with the chopper attachment to thoroughly blend tomato mixture. Transfer to a very large bowl.
5. Melt butter in the pot using the Saute function. Mix in flour; cook and stir to create a roux, about 3 minutes. Add 4 cups tomato mixture and stir well to prevent lumps.
6. Add remaining tomato mixture, sugar, salt, and red pepper flakes to the pot. Use an immersion blender with the whisk attachment to whisk soup until well blended and no lumps remain. Serve immediately.
