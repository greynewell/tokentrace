## Ingredients

- 1 cup cornmeal
- 2 teaspoons ground cayenne pepper
- 2 teaspoons paprika
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- ⅓ cup extra virgin olive oil
- 4 (4 ounce) fillets catfish
- 1 cup milk
- 4 cloves garlic, minced

## Instructions

1. In a mixing bowl, stir together cornmeal, cayenne pepper, paprika and onion powder. Mix well. Pour mixture onto a large sheet of waxed paper.
2. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
3. Pour milk into a medium bowl. Dip catfish filets into milk and hold up and let the milk drip off. Roll the milk-soaked filet in the cornmeal mixture until completely covered. Set aside.
4. Fry the garlic in the hot skillet, but do not burn. Add the coated catfish filets and cook for 5 to 7 minutes on each side, sprinkling salt on the fish after each turn. Cook until golden brown and fish flakes easily with a fork. Drain on paper towels.
