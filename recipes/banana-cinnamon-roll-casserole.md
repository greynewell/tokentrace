## Ingredients

- 4 large stale cinnamon rolls
- 1 ½ cups milk
- 5  eggs
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 2  bananas, divided
- ½ cup brown sugar

## Instructions

1. Slice cinnamon rolls into 1-inch squares. Whisk milk, eggs, vanilla extract, and cinnamon together in a bowl.
2. Slice 1 banana and layer on bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish; top with brown sugar. Layer cinnamon roll squares on top of banana. Pour egg mixture over cinnamon rolls; press cinnamon rolls with a spatula to allow egg mixture to fully coat. Cover with aluminum foil and refrigerate until egg mixture is absorbed, 1 hour to overnight.
