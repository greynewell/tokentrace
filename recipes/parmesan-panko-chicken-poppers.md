## Ingredients

- 2 cups panko bread crumbs
- 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- 2  eggs
- 1 tablespoon milk
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast, cut in bite-sized pieces
- oil for frying

## Instructions

1. Combine panko bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, salt, pepper, and garlic powder in a food processor; blend until finely crushed. Put panko mixture in a bowl.
2. Whisk eggs and milk in a separate bowl to make an egg wash. Place flour in a bowl.
3. Coat chicken pieces in flour; dip them into egg wash. Press into panko mixture to coat, shaking off excess.
4. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fry chicken in batches, until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 3 to 5 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
