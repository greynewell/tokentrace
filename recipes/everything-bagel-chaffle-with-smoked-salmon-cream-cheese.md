## Ingredients

- 1 large egg
- 3 teaspoons everything bagel seasoning, divided
- 1 teaspoon coconut flour
- ¼ teaspoon baking powder
- ½ cup shredded mozzarella cheese
- 4 tablespoons smoked salmon cream cheese spread (such as Philadelphia®)
- 1 teaspoon capers, drained
- 3  thin red onion slices

## Instructions

1. Preheat a waffle maker according to manufacturer's instructions.
2. Whisk egg, 2 teaspoons bagel seasoning, coconut flour, and baking powder together in a small bowl. Stir in mozzarella cheese.
3. Pour 1/2 of the batter onto the waffle maker and spread it out from the center with a spoon. Close the waffle maker and cook until the chaffle reaches your desired doneness and waffle maker stops steaming, 3 to 4 minutes.
4. Remove chaffle from waffle maker, place on a rack, and repeat process with remaining batter. Cool for several minutes to let them crisp up.
5. Spread each chaffle with 1/2 of the salmon cream cheese and garnish with remaining 1 teaspoon bagel seasoning, capers, and red onion. Cut out a circle in the center of the chaffle with a sharp knife or use a 1 1/2-inch round cookie cutter to make the chaffles look more authentic and fun.
