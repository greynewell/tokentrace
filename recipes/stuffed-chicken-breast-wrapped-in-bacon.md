## Ingredients

- 2  chicken breast fillets
- 1 (4 ounce) ball water-packed fresh mozzarella cheese, drained and sliced
- 2 cloves garlic, cut in half, divided
- 4 slices bacon
- 1  red onion, cut into wedges
- 1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
- 1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Make a pocket in each of the chicken breasts by slicing down one side, making sure to not slice all the way through. Stuff each pocket with mozzarella cheese and a 1/4 the minced garlic. Wrap 2 slices of bacon around each stuffed breast and secure in place with toothpicks. The pocket opening should be completely covered.
3. Combine onion and remaining garlic in a shallow baking dish and drizzle with olive oil. Place stuffed chicken breasts on top and sprinkle with rosemary.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
