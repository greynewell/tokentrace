## Ingredients

- 2  fennel bulbs
- 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
- 1  lemon, juiced
- 1 teaspoon lemon zest
- ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 pinch dried thyme
- 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

## Instructions

1. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.
2. Use a vegetable peeler or paring knife to slice a very thin layer from the bottom of each fennel bulb; leave core in place to hold bulb intact. Remove fennel stalks, reserving fronds. Slice bulbs vertically into 1/4-inch slices. Brush slices with 1 tablespoon olive oil; sprinkle ground black pepper and salt on each side.
3. Grill fennel slices in the preheated grill until charred, about 5 minutes per side; transfer to a serving platter.
4. Whisk remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil, basil, parsley, lemon juice, lemon zest, freshly ground black pepper, thyme, and reserved fennel fronds together in a bowl.
5. Sprinkle fennel slices with Parmesan cheese and drizzle lemon mixture on top.
