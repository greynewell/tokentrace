## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 ½ cups panko bread crumbs
- ¼ teaspoon garlic powder
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
- cooking spray
- ½ cup all-purpose flour
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 2 large eggs
- 2 tablespoons water
- 1 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- 8 cups mixed spring salad greens
- 2 large carrots, peeled and sliced diagonally
- 1 cup sliced radishes
- ¾ cup mayonnaise
- 3 tablespoons prepared yellow mustard
- 3 tablespoons honey
- 4 teaspoons Dijon mustard
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in an extra-large skillet over medium heat. Add panko and garlic powder. Cook, stirring, until toasted, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a shallow dish and let cool, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in parsley.
2. Coat an air fryer basket with cooking spray and preheat air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
3. Meanwhile, in another shallow dish, stir together flour, salt, and pepper. In a third shallow dish, whisk together eggs and water.
4. Cut chicken breasts lengthwise into 1x3-inch strips. Dip chicken strips into flour mixture, then egg mixture, then panko mixture to coat.
5. Working in batches, add chicken to the preheated air fryer. Cook, turning once, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest parts registers 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a plate; cover and keep warm.
6. Toss together salad greens, carrots, and radishes in a large bowl.
7. Stir mayonnaise, yellow mustard, honey, Dijon mustard, and lemon juice for dressing together in a small bowl.
8. Divide salad among plates, top with chicken, and drizzle with dressing.
