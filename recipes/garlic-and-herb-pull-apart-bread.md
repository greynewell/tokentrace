## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- ½ cup butter, melted
- 2 teaspoons dried parsley
- 2 teaspoons dried rosemary, crushed
- 2 teaspoons dried basil
- 7 cloves garlic, crushed and chopped
- 2 (10 ounce) cans refrigerated biscuit dough

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a fluted tube pan (such as a Bundt® with cooking spray.
2. In a bowl, mix together the melted butter, parsley, rosemary, basil, and garlic. Separate the biscuits, and dip each biscuit into the butter and herbs; place biscuits in a random pattern into the prepared pan. If there is any unused butter mixture, pour it over the biscuits.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until the bread is browned and cooked through in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from oven, and invert the pan on a cutting board; the bread will fall out of the pan in one piece. Serve by pulling the bread apart into individual servings.
