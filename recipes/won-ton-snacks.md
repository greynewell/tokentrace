## Ingredients

- 2 pounds ground pork
- 2 stalks celery
- 2  carrots
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1 small onion
- 1 (8 ounce) can water chestnuts
- ½ cup prepared Thai peanut sauce
- 1 (14 ounce) package round wonton wrappers

## Instructions

1. In a food processor, finely chop the celery, carrots, garlic, onion, and water chestnuts.
2. The pieces should be small and fairly uniform, but not liquid.
3. In a large skillet, combine the ground pork and chopped vegetables.
4. Cook over medium heat until the vegetables are soft, and the pork is no longer pink.

7. Press one wonton wrap into each cup of a mini muffin pan, with the edges flared out to the sides.
8. Place one scoop of the meat mixture into each cup.
9. Bake for about 12 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the outer wrappers are crisp and golden.
10. Allow to cool slightly in the pan before removing to a serving tray.
