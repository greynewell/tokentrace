## Ingredients

- 2 cups milk
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 2  egg yolks
- 1  egg
- ¼ cup cornstarch
- ⅓ cup white sugar
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Stir together milk and 1/4 cup sugar in a heavy saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat.
2. Whisk together egg yolks and egg in a medium bowl. Stir together 1/3 cup sugar and cornstarch in a separate bowl; stir into eggs until smooth.
3. Pour boiled milk into egg mixture in a thin stream while mixing so eggs do not cook. Return egg mixture to the saucepan; slowly bring to a boil, stirring constantly to prevent curdling and scorching.
4. When mixture thickens, remove from the heat and stir in butter and vanilla until thoroughly blended. Pour into a heat-proof container; place a piece of plastic wrap directly on the surface to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate until chilled before using.
