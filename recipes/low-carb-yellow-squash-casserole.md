## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 teaspoon butter
- 1 small onion, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 4 cups peeled and cubed yellow squash
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- ⅓ cup finely chopped raw almonds
- 1 cup shredded Colby-Monterey Jack cheese, divided
- ½ cup heavy whipping cream
- 2  eggs
- ⅓ cup coarsely chopped roasted, salted almonds

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Heat olive oil and butter in a skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir onion and garlic in the hot oil-butter mixture until softened, about 3 minutes. Add squash, salt, and pepper; stir to combine. Cover skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until squash is softened, about 5 minutes. Transfer squash mixture to a large bowl.
