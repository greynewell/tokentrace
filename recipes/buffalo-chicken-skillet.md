## Ingredients

- ¾ teaspoon salt
- ¾ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 3 pounds chicken breast tenderloins
- 6  eggs
- 1 ½ cups panko bread crumbs
- 9 tablespoons canola oil, divided
- ¾ cup Buffalo wing sauce (such as Frank's®), or to taste

## Instructions

1. Sprinkle salt and black pepper over chicken breast tenderloins.
2. Whisk eggs in a shallow bowl until smooth. Place panko in a separate shallow bowl.
3. Dip both sides of each chicken breast in the eggs and then in the panko.
