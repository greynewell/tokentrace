## Ingredients

- 1 cup unsalted butter
- 6 (1 ounce) squares unsweetened chocolate, chopped
- 3 cups white sugar
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 4 large eggs, at room temperature
- 1 ⅔ cups all-purpose flour

- 3 cups roughly chopped chocolate sandwich cookies (such as Oreo®)  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 9x13-inch baking dish with aluminum foil and lightly grease the foil.
2. Combine butter and chocolate in a medium saucepan over low heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until melted, about 5 minutes. Whisk in white sugar, vanilla extract, and salt. Turn off the heat.
3. Whisk in eggs, 1 at a time. Stir in flour and cocoa powder until mixture is well combined. Fold in chopped cookies. Pour batter into the prepared baking dish and sprinkle with crushed cookies.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out mostly clean with a few moist crumbs, about 35 minutes. Place on a wire rack until completely cool, about 30 minutes.
5. Meanwhile, whisk powdered sugar and milk together in a small bowl until mixture has reached a drizzling consistency. Drizzle glaze over the top of the brownies.
