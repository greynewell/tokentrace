## Ingredients

- 8  mangoes - peeled, seeded, and sliced
- 2 cups water
- ½ cup white sugar
- 2 cups white sugar
- ½ cup butter, softened
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 4 teaspoons baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup milk
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
