## Ingredients

- 4 tablespoons cinnamon bun topping (such as Popcorn Powder®)
- ¼ cup unsalted butter, melted, or more as needed
- ½ cup semisweet chocolate chips
- 1 (8 ounce) package refrigerated crescent rolls

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Mix cinnamon bun topping and melted butter in a small bowl until well combined.
3. Melt chocolate chips in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in the microwave for 15-second intervals, stirring after each interval, about 1 minute. Be careful not to burn the chocolate.
4. Separate crescent dough into 16 triangles. Spread 1/2 teaspoon of the cinnamon mixture onto each triangle and drizzle some of the chocolate on top. Carefully begin to roll starting at shortest side of triangle up to the opposite point. Once rolled, spread another 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon mixture on top.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 10 to 13 minutes.
