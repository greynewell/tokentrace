## Ingredients

- 3 ½ cups all-purpose flour, or as needed
- 1 envelope Fleischmann's® Pizza Crust Yeast
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt
- 1 ⅓ cups very warm water (120 degrees to 130 degrees F)*
- ⅓ cup oil
- 1 tablespoon Additional flour for rolling
- 1 teaspoon Additional oil for grilling
- ½ cup Pizza sauce
- Other toppings as desired
- 1 ounce Shredded mozzarella cheese

## Instructions

1. Start a charcoal fire or preheat a gas grill to medium-high heat.
2. Combine 2 cups flour, undissolved yeast, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Add warm water and 1/3 cup oil; mix until well blended, about 1 minute. Gradually add enough flour to make a soft dough that forms a ball and is slightly sticky. Knead on a floured surface, adding additional flour if necessary, until smooth and elastic but not sticky, about 5 minutes.
3. Divide dough into 8 portions. Pat or roll dough on a well-floured counter to about 8-inch circles; they do not need to be perfect.
4. Brush both sides of crusts with additional oil. Using hands, lift each crust carefully and place on grill. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes until bottoms are lightly browned and tops look set. Using long handled tongs, remove crusts from grill and place on a baking sheet with grilled-sides facing up.
5. Lightly add sauce to the top of each grilled crust, then top with mozzarella cheese.
6. Carefully slide pizzas back onto the grill. Cook an additional 3 to 4 minutes until bottom crusts are browned and cheese is melted. Remove from the grill and serve immediately.
