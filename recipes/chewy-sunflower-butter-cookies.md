## Ingredients

- 1 cup shortening
- 1 cup crunchy sunflower seed butter (such as SunButter®)
- ¾ cup white sugar

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
2. Combine shortening, sunflower seed butter, white sugar, and brown sugar in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until light and airy. Add eggs one at a time and continue beating on medium speed until very light.
3. Sift flour, baking soda, ground ginger, and salt into a separate bowl. Mix well. Stir in candied ginger, chocolate, and sunflower seeds.
