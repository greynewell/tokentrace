## Ingredients

- ⅓ cup packed brown sugar
- ¼ cup maple syrup
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- ¾ teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper  (Optional)
- 3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
- 2 cups rolled oats
- ¾ cup chopped almonds

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).
2. Combine brown sugar, maple syrup, vegetable oil, vanilla extract, salt, cayenne pepper, and cocoa powder in a bowl. Whisk thoroughly. Add oats and almonds. Toss and smear the mixture together using a spatula until well coated. Spread mixture evenly over a silicone-lined baking sheet.
3. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Toss granola with a fork, breaking up any clumps to get a finer texture. Continue baking until desired texture is reached, 30 to 60 minutes more. Sprinkle some granola onto a plate; if it clinks, it is ready. Turn off the oven and leave granola inside the oven to dry and cool to room temperature.
