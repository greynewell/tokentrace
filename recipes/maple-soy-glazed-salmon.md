## Ingredients

- 1  untreated cedar plank
- 2 ½ pounds boneless salmon fillet
- 1 teaspoon coarse salt
- ½ teaspoon black pepper
- ¼ cup maple syrup
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons melted butter
- 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
- ½ teaspoon lime zest
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives

## Instructions

1. Soak the cedar plank in water for 2 hours.
2. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil grate. Place the cedar plank across the grate of the grill as it preheats.
3. Season the salmon fillet with salt and pepper, and place onto the hot cedar plank skin-side down. Close the lid on the grill, and whisk together the maple syrup, soy sauce, butter, lime juice, and lime zest.
