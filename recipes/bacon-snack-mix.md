## Ingredients

- 12 slices bacon, or more to taste
- ½ cup butter
- ½ cup light brown sugar
- ⅓ cup light corn syrup
- 2 tablespoons bourbon
- 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1 teaspoon chipotle chile powder, or more to taste
- 2 (10 ounce) cans mixed nuts
- 4 cups crispy rice cereal squares
- 4 cups crispy corn cereal squares
- 3 cups mini pretzels
- 1 cup oatmeal cereal squares (such as Quaker® Oatmeal Squares), crushed

## Instructions

1. Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until very crisp and evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels.
2. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line 1/2-sheet cake pans or large baking pans with parchment paper, allowing paper to overlap the sides and ends.
3. Microwave butter in a large heat-proof glass measuring cup until melted. Mix in brown sugar, corn syrup, bourbon, and Worcestershire sauce. Return butter mixture to the microwave and heat on high for 2 minutes.
4. Whisk chipotle powder into the butter mixture until mixture thickens to a sticky, very light caramel.
5. Combine mixed nuts, rice squares, corn cereal, pretzels, and oatmeal squares in a very large mixing bowl. Crumble in the cooled bacon and stir to combine. Pour the caramel-bourbon mixture evenly on top. Gently fold in using a large silicone spatula, hugging the sides of the bowl and working spatula inward, until pieces are evenly coated.
6. Pour snack mix into a thin, even layer on the prepared baking pans.
7. Bake in the preheated oven until dry and crispy, 20 to 25 minutes. Flip pieces over halfway through using the silicone spatula. Remove from oven and let cool completely on the pan, at least 30 minutes.
8. Pull the edges of the parchment paper up to create a pouch and pour finished mix into a large, clean mixing bowl. Gently separate any clumps. Transfer snack mix to clean, airtight storage containers or resealable zip-top bags.
