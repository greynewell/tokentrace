## Ingredients

- 1 (8 ounce) package vegetarian sausage links (such as Morningstar Farms®)
- ½ cup water, or more as needed
- 4 cups shredded sweet potatoes
- ¼ cup butter, melted
- 1 ½ (8 ounce) packages shredded, reduced-fat mild Cheddar-mozzarella cheese blend
- ½ cup finely chopped onion
- 1 cup finely sliced fresh spinach leaves
- 1 (16 ounce) container low-fat small curd cottage cheese
- 8 jumbo eggs

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
2. Place sausage in a large skillet and pour in about 1/4 inch of water; cook sausage over medium heat until water evaporates and sausages are evenly browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Crumble cooked sausages into a bowl.
3. Mix sweet potatoes and butter together in a bowl; evenly spread into the bottom of the prepared 9x13-inch dish.
4. Stir Cheddar-mozzarella cheese blend, onion, spinach, cottage cheese, eggs, and crumbled sausage together in a large bowl; spoon over sweet potato layer.
5. Bake casserole in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean and eggs are set, about 1 hour. Cool 5 minutes before serving.
