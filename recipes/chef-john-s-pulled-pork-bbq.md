## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons dry barbeque rub, or more as needed
- 1 (3 1/2) pound bone-in pork shoulder blade roast
- ½ teaspoon liquid smoke flavoring, divided
- 1 cup water, divided
- ¾ cup barbeque sauce, or as needed
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 12  soft white hamburger buns
- ¾ cup barbeque sauce, divided

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 210 degrees F (100 degrees C).
2. Sprinkle dry rub generously on all sides of pork roast and place meat into a heavy pan or Dutch oven.
3. Pour 1/4 teaspoon of liquid smoke flavoring into each of two 6-ounce ramekins; fill ramekins with 1/2 cup water each. Place ramekins into the Dutch oven on either side of the roast. Place lid onto Dutch oven.
