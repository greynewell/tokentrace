## Ingredients

- 1 pound peppercorn bacon, diced
- 5 pounds ground venison
- 2 cups bread crumbs
- ½ cup Worcestershire sauce
- ¼ cup evaporated milk
- 5 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper

## Instructions

1. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
2. Place bacon in a stainless steel bowl; add venison, bread crumbs, Worcestershire sauce, milk, garlic, and cayenne pepper. Mix venison mixture using your hands and form into 5-ounce balls. Press balls with the back of a side dish to form patties.
