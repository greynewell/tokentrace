## Ingredients

- 2 ½ cups walnut halves
- 1 cup shelled pistachios
- 1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon
- ½ cup unsalted butter, melted
- 12 sheets phyllo dough, thawed if frozen
- 1 ½ cups sugar
- ¾ cup water
- ¼ cup honey
- 3  whole cloves
- ¼ teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 ½ teaspoons orange flower water

## Instructions

1. Place walnuts, pistachios, and cinnamon in bowl of a food processor. Pulse on and off until mixture is chopped but not too fine.
2. Brush bottom of 9-inch round baking pan with melted butter. Place one round of phyllo dough in the pan; add a second round of dough. Drip about 1 tablespoon of melted butter over the top. Add 2 more sheets and drizzle with butter. Add 2 more sheets and drip with butter creating 6 layers for the bottom. (While you work keep the phyllo sheets covered with a damp, nearly dry, cotton towel to keep dough from drying out.)
3. Sprinkle with 1/3 of the nut mixture. Top with a sheet of phyllo and drip with melted butter; repeat with 1 more sheet of filo. Add another 1/3 of the nut mixture.
4. Place another sheet of phyllo on the nuts; drip with butter. Top with another sheet and drip with butter. Add the remaining nut mixture.
5. Top with 2 sheets of phyllo; drip with butter. Add 2 more sheets; drip with butter. Top with the last 2 sheets and drizzle generously with the remaining butter. Cover pan with plastic and refrigerate until completely chilled, about 1 hour.
6. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
7. Cut baklava into about 12 diamond-shaped pieces approximately the same size.
8. Bake in preheated oven until browned and crisp, about an hour.
9. Place sugar, honey, and cloves in a saucepan. Pour in water. Place pan over medium-high heat and whisk to combine. Bring to a boil; remove from heat. Whisk in vanilla and orange blossom water.
10. After baklava has rested 5 minutes, ladle syrup over the top. Cool down to room temperature before serving.
