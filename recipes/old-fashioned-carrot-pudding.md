## Ingredients

- ½ cup shortening
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ½ teaspoon ground cloves
- 1 cup grated carrots
- 1 cup raisins
- 1 cup chopped walnuts
- ¾ cup white sugar
- 1 ½ teaspoons cornstarch
- 1 pinch salt
- 1 ¼ cups hot water
- 3 ½ teaspoons butter
- 3 ½ teaspoons lemon juice
- 1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. In a large bowl, cream together the shortening and 1 cup of sugar until light and fluffy. Combine the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves; stir into the creamed mixture until well blended. The mixture will be dry. Stir in the carrots, raisins and chopped walnuts. Pour into a well-greased pudding mold or coffee can. Cover the top with aluminum foil.
2. Place the pudding mold into a large kettle or Dutch oven filled with 2 inches of water. Cover the pan, and bring to a simmer. Allow the pudding to steam for 4 to 4 1/2 hours over low heat. Remove from the mold. Serve with warm lemon sauce.
3. To make the lemon sauce, mix together 3/4 cup of sugar, cornstarch and salt in a saucepan. Stir in hot water, butter, lemon juice and vanilla. Cook over medium heat until thickened. Serve warm over the pudding.
