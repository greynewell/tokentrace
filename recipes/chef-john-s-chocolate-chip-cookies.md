## Ingredients

- 2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 ¼ teaspoons kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 cup unsalted butter, very soft
- 1 cup white sugar
- ½ cup light brown sugar
- 1  large egg
- 2 tablespoons milk
- 1 ¼ teaspoons vanilla extract
- 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. Whisk flour, salt, and baking soda together in a bowl. In a separate bowl, cream the butter, white sugar, and brown sugar together until mixture is light and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the egg, milk, and vanilla extract. Whisk liquids together in small areas around the bowl, then all together to avoid separation.
2. Pour dry ingredients into the wet ingredients; stir until flour is thoroughly mixed in. Stir in the chocolate chips.
3. Transfer dough to a resealable plastic bag. Refrigerate until dough is firm, at least 2 hours.
4. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line baking sheet with parchment paper.
5. Scoop out rounded tablespoons of dough and place on prepared baking sheet, leaving 4 inches of space between cookies (about 8 per sheet). Bake in preheated oven until cookies are golden brown, about 12 minutes. Slide parchment and cookies onto a cooling rack for a few minutes. Remove parchment and finish cooling the cookies on the rack.
