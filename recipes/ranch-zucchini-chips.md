## Ingredients

- 1 medium zucchini, sliced
- salt to taste
- 2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 tablespoon ranch dressing mix (such as Hidden Valley Ranch®)
- 1 teaspoon freeze-dried dill
- cooking spray

## Instructions

1. Slice the zucchini using a mandoline into 1/16-inch-thick rounds. Spread out on a clean work surface and sprinkle with salt. Let sit for 10 minutes. Remove as much moisture from the zucchini slices as you can with a paper towel.
2. Preheat the oven to 220 degrees F (105 degrees C).
3. Combine zucchini chips and olive oil in a large bowl and stir to coat. Season with ranch powder and dill and gently stir to coat.
4. Spray 2 large baking sheets with nonstick cooking spray. Arrange zucchini slices on the sheets in one layer, making sure none are overlapping.
5. Bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes. Carefully flip the slices and continue baking for 30 minutes, or until desired crispiness is reached. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.
