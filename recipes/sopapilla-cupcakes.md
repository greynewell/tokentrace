## Ingredients

- 1 (16.5 ounce) package white cake mix
- 1 cup water
- 3  large egg whites
- ¼ cup oil
- 2 tablespoons ground cinnamon, divided
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ½ teaspoon lemon extract
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- ½ cup butter, room temperature
- 3 cups confectioners' sugar, or more as needed
- 3 tablespoons honey
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 2 tablespoons milk, or as needed
- 1 tablespoon honey, for drizzling

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line 18 muffin cups with paper liners.
2. Mix cake mix, water, egg whites, oil, 1 tablespoon cinnamon, vanilla extract, and lemon extract together in the bowl of a stand mixer; mix on low for 30 seconds. Increase speed to medium and mix batter for 2 minutes. Fill muffin cups 2/3-full with batter.
3. Combine white sugar and 1 tablespoon cinnamon together in a small bowl; sprinkle over batter.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in a cupcake comes out clean, about 15 minutes. Cool cupcakes to room temperature.
5. Beat butter in a bowl using an electric mixer until creamy and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes. Add confectioners' sugar, 3 tablespoons honey, and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon; beat until just combined. Mix milk, 1 tablespoon at a time, into creamed butter mixture until desired consistency of frosting is reached. Spoon frosting into a piping bag or a plastic bag with a snipped corner; pipe onto each cupcake. Drizzle honey over each frosted cupcake.
