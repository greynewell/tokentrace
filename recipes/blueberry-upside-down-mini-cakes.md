## Ingredients

- 2 cups frozen blueberries
- 1  lemon, zested and juiced, divided
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- ½ cup unsalted butter, softened
- ½ cup white sugar
- 2  eggs
- 1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 ¾ teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon ground ginger
- 1 pinch salt
- ½ cup milk

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter six 4-inch ramekins and place in a 9x13-inch baking pan.
2. Mix blueberries, lemon zest, and 2 tablespoons white sugar together in a small bowl.
3. Microwave 2 tablespoons butter in a microwave-safe bowl until melted, about 30 seconds. Stir in brown sugar. Spread equal amounts into the bottom of each ramekin. Divide the blueberry mixture evenly into the ramekins.
4. Beat 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup white sugar in a large bowl using an electric mixer until fluffy. Add eggs 1 at a time, mixing after each addition. Mix in lemon juice and vanilla extract. Add flour, baking powder, ginger, and salt; stir until combined. Mix in milk. Spoon batter into the ramekins over the blueberry mixture.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 25 to 35 minutes.
6. Let cool in the ramekins for 5 minutes. Run a knife around the edges of the cakes; invert onto a plate.
