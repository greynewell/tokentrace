## Ingredients

- 4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- ½ cup milk
- 1 cup butter, melted
- 3 tablespoons butter, melted

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.
2. Stir together the flour, salt, baking powder, milk, and 1 cup of melted butter. When the dough begins to pull together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic.
3. Roll out the dough to 1/8 inch thickness and cut into 8-inch circles. Brush the circles with the remaining melted butter. Fold each circle in half and then in half again, into triangles; press firmly to seal the layers. Place the rolls on the prepared baking sheet.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Serve warm.
