## Ingredients

- ¼ cup olive oil
- 4 large carrots, chopped
- 1 large white onion, finely chopped
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt
- 2 teaspoons chopped fresh parsley
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ teaspoon ground ginger
- ½ teaspoon dried tarragon
- ½ teaspoon cumin
- 1 (16 ounce) package dry lentils
- 1 cup crushed tomatoes
- 2 quarts vegetable broth
- 1 (10 ounce) package spinach
- 1 large zucchini, cut into small pieces
- 1 pinch salt to taste
- 1 teaspoon olive oil, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir carrots, onion, salt, parsley, black pepper, ginger, tarragon, and cumin in the hot oil until the onion is translucent, 5 to 7 minutes.
