## Ingredients

- ⅛ cup chopped dried cherries
- ⅛ cup chopped dried mango
- ¼ cup dried cranberries
- ¼ cup dried currants
- 2 tablespoons chopped candied citron
- ¼ cup dark rum
- ½ cup butter
- ¼ cup packed brown sugar
- 1  egg
- ½ cup all-purpose flour
- ⅛ teaspoon baking soda
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ¼ cup unsulfured molasses
- 2 tablespoons milk
- ¼ cup chopped pecans
- ¼ cup dark rum, divided

## Instructions

1. Soak the fruit: Place cranberries, currants, cherries, mango, and citron into a medium bowl and stir to combine. Pour in rum and mix again. Cover tightly, and store at room temperature for at least 24 hours.
2. When ready to make the fruitcake, preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Cut a 6-inch circle of parchment paper. Spray a 6x3-inch round pan with cooking spray. Place the parchment circle in the bottom of the pan, and spray it with cooking spray.
3. Beat butter and brown sugar in a large bowl until light and creamy, about 3 minutes. Beat in egg until incorporated.
4. Whisk together flour, salt, cinnamon, and baking soda in a separate bowl. Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture in 3 batches, alternating with molasses, beating batter briefly after each addition.
5. Stir in soaked fruit and pecans. Scrape batter into the prepared pan and smooth out the top.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes.
7. While the fruitcake is baking, cut one piece parchment paper and one piece cheesecloth, each large enough to wrap around the cake.
8. Remove fruitcake from the oven and cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then drizzle 2 tablespoons rum over top.
9. Moisten the cheesecloth with 1 tablespoon rum. Place it on top of the parchment paper, and unmold fruitcake onto it. Brush the top and sides of fruitcake with remaining 3 tablespoons rum. Wrap the cheesecloth closely to the surface of the cake, then wrap with the parchment paper.
10. Transfer the wrapped fruitcake to airtight container or tin. Seal the container and let age at room temperature for at least 10 weeks before serving.
