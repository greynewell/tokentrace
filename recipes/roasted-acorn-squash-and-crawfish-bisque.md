## Ingredients

- ½ cup light brown sugar
- ¼ cup butter
- 1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder
- 4  acorn squash, halved and seeded
- ¼ cup butter
- 1 cup minced yellow onion
- 1 cup minced celery
- 1 cup minced red bell pepper
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic
- 2 quarts seafood stock
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1 cup thinly sliced fresh basil
- 1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- sea salt and white pepper to taste
- 2 (16 ounce) packages cooked and peeled whole crawfish tails

## Instructions

1. Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
2. Combine the brown sugar with 1/4 cup butter, cinnamon, and five spice powder in a microwave safe bowl. Cook in the microwave on High until the butter has completely melted. Place the acorn squash cut side up onto the aluminum foil; brush with the brown sugar mixture.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until the squash is tender and golden brown, about 1 1/2 hours. Remove from the oven, allow to cool, and scoop out and reserve the flesh.
4. Melt the remaining 1/4 cup of butter in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in the onion, celery, and bell pepper. Cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the acorn squash, garlic, and seafood stock. Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 30 minutes.
5. Stir the cream and basil into the simmering soup; season with nutmeg, salt, and white pepper. Pour the soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until smooth and pour into a clean pot. Alternately, you can use a stick blender and puree the soup right in the cooking pot. Once pureed, add the crawfish tails, and simmer a few minutes until hot.
