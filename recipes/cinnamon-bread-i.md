## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 cup white sugar
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- 1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup buttermilk
- ¼ cup vegetable oil
- 2  eggs
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 2 teaspoons margarine

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
2. Make bread: Beat flour, sugar, buttermilk, eggs, oil, vanilla, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, and baking soda in a large mixing bowl until well combined, about 3 minutes. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan; smooth the top.
3. Make topping: Stir together sugar, margarine, and cinnamon in a small bowl until crumbly; sprinkle over batter. Use a paring knife to swirl batter for a marbled effect.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 50 minutes. Remove bread from the pan to a wire rack to cool completely.
