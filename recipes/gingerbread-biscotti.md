## Ingredients

- ⅓ cup vegetable oil
- 1 cup white sugar
- 3  eggs
- ¼ cup molasses
- 2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 cup whole wheat flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1 ½ tablespoons ground ginger
- ¾ tablespoon ground cinnamon
- ½ tablespoon ground cloves
- ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a cookie sheet.
2. In a large bowl, mix together oil, sugar, eggs, and molasses. In another bowl, combine flours, baking powder, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg; mix into egg mixture to form a stiff dough.
3. Divide dough in half, and shape each half into a roll the length of the cookie. Place rolls on cookie sheet, and pat down to flatten the dough to 1/2 inch thickness.
4. Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove from oven, and set aside to cool.
5. When cool enough to touch, cut into 1/2 inch thick diagonal slices. Place sliced biscotti on cookie sheet, and bake an additional 5 to 7 minutes on each side, or until toasted and crispy.
