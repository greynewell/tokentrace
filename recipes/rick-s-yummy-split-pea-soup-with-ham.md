## Ingredients

- 1 (14 ounce) bag green split peas, rinsed
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 ½ cups finely chopped onion
- 1 ½ cups finely chopped carrots
- 1 cup finely chopped celery
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic, or to taste
- 7 cups chicken broth, or more as needed, divided
- 1  bay leaf, or more to taste
- ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon ground thyme
- 2 pounds smoked pork neck bones (such as Smithfield®)
- 10 ounces cubed smoked ham (such as Carolina Pride®)

## Instructions

1. Place the split peas into a large container and cover with several inches of cool water; let stand for at least 3 hours. Rinse peas until the water runs clear; drain.
2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion, carrots, and celery in hot oil until soft, 8 to 12 minutes. Add garlic and saute until fragrant, about 1 minute.
3. Combine peas, onion mixture, 6 cups chicken broth, bay leaf, black pepper, and thyme together in a large pot. Stir neck bones into chicken broth mixture, adding more chicken broth as necessary to cover bones completely. Bring mixture to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, cover the pot, and simmer until peas have dissolved and meat is falling from the bones, 2 to 3 hours. Transfer bones to a plate to cool.
4. Stir cubed ham into soup. When neck bones are cool enough to handle, remove remaining meat from the bones; discard bones and stir meat into soup. Continue to simmer until ham and meat are heated through, about 5 minutes.
