## Ingredients

- ⅓ cup salted butter
- ⅓ cup chopped fresh rosemary
- 2 cloves garlic
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 2 teaspoons lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
- 4  skinless, boneless chicken breasts (such as Perdue®)
- 1  lemon, zested

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Blend butter, rosemary, garlic, 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons lemon juice, thyme, and olive oil together in an electric blender. Pour a small amount into a skillet placed over high heat, covering the bottom.
3. Place chicken breasts in the skillet and pour remaining butter mixture on top. Cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes, flipping as needed. Transfer to a baking dish and pour mixture from the skillet over the chicken. Lightly dust with lemon zest.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the centers and juices run clear, 25 to 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a chicken breast should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove and let stand for 5 minutes before serving.
