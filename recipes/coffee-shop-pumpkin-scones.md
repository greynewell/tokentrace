## Ingredients

- 2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
- ¾ cup white sugar
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ¼ teaspoon ground cloves
- ¼ teaspoon ground ginger
- 3 tablespoons cold butter
- 3 tablespoons shortening
- ¾ cup canned pumpkin
- 1  egg
- 2 tablespoons half-and-half
- 1 cup confectioners' sugar

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.
2. Mix flour, white sugar, baking powder, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, salt, nutmeg, cloves, and ginger together in a large bowl; cut in butter and shortening using a pastry cutter or 2 knives until mixture is crumbly.
