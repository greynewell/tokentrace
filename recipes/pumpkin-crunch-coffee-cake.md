## Ingredients

- 1 cup packed brown sugar
- ¾ cup chopped pecans
- ¼ cup melted butter
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon ground cloves
- ½ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1 (15.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
2. Stir brown sugar, pecans, butter, flour, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg together in a bowl to make crunch mixture.
