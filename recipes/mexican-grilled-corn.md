## Ingredients

- ½ cup mayonnaise
- 1  lime, juiced
- 1 tablespoon ground ancho chile pepper
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 8 ears corn on the cob, husked
- ¼ cup butter, melted, or as needed
- ½ cup freshly grated Cotija cheese
- 1 pinch salt to taste
- 1  lime, sliced

## Instructions

1. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.
2. Combine mayonnaise, lime juice, ancho chile powder, and smoked paprika in a bowl; whisk until smooth. Refrigerate until needed.
3. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Boil corn in the salted water for 5 minutes. Drain the corn.
4. Place ears of corn on hot grill and cook until the kernels begin to brown and caramelize, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn the corn and continue to cook, turning ears after 1 to 2 minutes, until they are browned with slightly charred, caramelized spots.
5. Generously brush corn with melted butter and ancho-lime mayonnaise until kernels are coated. Sprinkle ears with Cotija cheese and salt. Garnish with slices of lime.
