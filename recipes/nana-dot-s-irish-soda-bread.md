## Ingredients

- 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ teaspoons baking soda
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 3 tablespoons white sugar
- ½ cup butter, cut into pieces
- 1 cup raisins
- ½ cup currants
- 2 teaspoons caraway seed  (Optional)
- ¾ cup milk
- 3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 2 baking sheets.
2. Stir together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and sugar in a large bowl until evenly blended. Cut in the butter using a pastry blender or your hands until the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal. Stir in the raisins, currants, and caraway seeds, then make a well in the center and pour in the milk and vinegar. Stir with a spoon until the dry ingredients are moistened.
3. Turn the dough out onto a well floured work surface, and knead gently 8 to 10 times. Divide the dough into two balls, and place onto the prepared baking sheets.
4. Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes, then reduce heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C), and bake until the top of the bread is golden brown, about 15 minutes more.
