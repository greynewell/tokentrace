## Ingredients

- red food coloring
- 1 cup vegetable shortening, plus
- 3 tablespoons vegetable shortening
- 1 cup sugar
- 1  egg, beaten
- 1 teaspoon almond extract
- 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Pour a few drops of red food coloring into a small bowl, and set aside.
2. With an electric mixer, beat the shortening together with the sugar in a mixing bowl until creamy. Beat in the egg and almond extract.
3. In another bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Stir the flour mixture into the sugar-shortening mixture, and mix well. Scoop up a scant tablespoon of dough with a spoon, and form into a walnut-sized ball. Place the ball onto an ungreased cookie sheet, and press the ball slightly with your thumb to create a flat spot on top (don't flatten the cookie). Dip the end of a bamboo chopstick into the red food coloring, and touch the center of each cookie to make a red dot.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until slightly browned, 15 to 18 minutes. Cool on a rack.
