## Ingredients

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 cup whole milk
- 2  eggs
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 3 tablespoons beef or bacon drippings

## Instructions

1. In a large bowl, mix together the flour, milk, eggs and salt. Using an electric mixer, beat 5 minutes, until smooth. Cover and refrigerate 1 hour.
2. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Coat a 9x13 inch baking pan with beef or bacon drippings. Preheat the pan 15 minutes so the drippings are hot and sizzling.
3. Remove the mixture from the refrigerator. Beat briefly, then scoop into the baking pan. Bake 20 minutes.
4. Lower oven temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Without opening the oven, continue baking 15 minutes. The mixture should be puffed and golden brown. Remove from oven and serve hot.
