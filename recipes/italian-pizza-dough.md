## Ingredients

- 1 ½ teaspoons active dry yeast
- ½ teaspoon white sugar
- ½ cup lukewarm water
- 2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1  egg, beaten

## Instructions

1. Stir yeast and sugar into lukewarm water, using a fork. Let stand in a warm place until a creamy layer forms on top of the water, about 10 minutes.
2. Mix flour and salt in a large bowl. Mix olive oil into flour and stir for 2 minutes. Pour yeast mixture and beaten egg into flour mixture and stir to make a stiff dough. Turn dough out onto a floured work surface and knead until springy and smooth, about 8 minutes. Place dough into a floured bowl and cover with a piece of plastic wrap wiped with a thin film of olive oil.
3. Let dough rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch down and roll out to desired shape.
