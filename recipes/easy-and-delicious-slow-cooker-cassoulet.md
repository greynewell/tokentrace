## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 6 slices turkey bacon
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 4  boneless, skinless chicken thighs, chopped
- ¼ pound fully-cooked smoked sausage, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme leaves
- 2  bay leaves
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ¼ cup tomato paste
- 3 (15 ounce) cans great Northern beans, drained and rinsed
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, drained

## Instructions

1. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat and cook bacon until crisp and brown, turning often, about 10 minutes. Remove bacon and drain on paper towels; crumble when cool. Set bacon aside.
2. Cook and stir onion in the same skillet until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in chicken, sausage, garlic, thyme, bay leaves, and black pepper; cook until chicken pieces are browned, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir in tomato paste.
