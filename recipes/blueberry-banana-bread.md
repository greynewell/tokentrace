## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ cup butter, softened
- 1 cup white sugar
- 2  eggs
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 2  ripe bananas, mashed
- 1 cup fresh blueberries

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 3 mini loaf pans.
2. Mix together flour, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl.
3. Beat sugar and butter with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light in color and fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in vanilla extract; beat in mashed bananas. Add flour mixture a little at a time, beating until just combined into a thick batter. Fold in blueberries until evenly distributed. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pans.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then transfer loaves to cool completely on a wire rack.
