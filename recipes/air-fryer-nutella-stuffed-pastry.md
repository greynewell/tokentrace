## Ingredients

- 1 (10 ounce) can refrigerated biscuit dough (such as Pillsbury Grands Jr.®)
- 5 tablespoons chocolate-hazelnut spread (such as Nutella®), or more to taste
- cooking spray
- 2 tablespoons salted butter, melted
- 1 tablespoon powdered sugar, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Lightly flour a clean work surface and a rolling pin.
2. Separate each biscuit and roll each dough piece into an 8x3 1/2-inch sheet. Spread 1 1/2 teaspoons chocolate-hazelnut spread down the center of each piece, keeping 1 inch bare at the top and bottom. Fold the top and bottom down towards the center of the sheet. Roll up the remaining dough tightly to create a cigar shape.
3. Preheat the air fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly spray the basket with cooking spray.
4. Set pastries into the air fryer basket, seam-side down, leaving at least 2 inches between individual pastries since they will expand. Work in batches depending on the size of your air fryer. Brush tops with butter.
5. Air fry until golden browned and puffed up, about 5 minutes.
6. Transfer pastries to a serving dish. Brush with more butter and lightly dust with powdered sugar.
