## Ingredients

- 2 cups vegetable broth
- 1 cup brown lentils, rinsed
- 1 cup quick-cooking oats
- 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
- ½ cup panko bread crumbs
- 2  eggs, beaten

- 4 tablespoons ketchup
- 2  garlic cloves, crushed
- 1 tablespoon dried parsley
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- ½ teaspoon red pepper flakes
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Combine broth and lentils in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until lentils are soft and broth is absorbed, 20 to 30 minutes. Drain extra broth, if necessary. Mash lentils slightly and transfer to a large mixing bowl.

3. Add oats, Cheddar cheese, panko, eggs, onion, ketchup, garlic, parsley, Worcestershire sauce, basil, red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper to the bowl with the lentils and mix well. Transfer mixture to the prepared loaf pan.
