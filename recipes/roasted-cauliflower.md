## Ingredients

- ¼ cup butter, softened
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon grated lemon zest
- ½ teaspoon ground cumin
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 large head cauliflower, leaves trimmed

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Mix butter, dill, garlic, lemon zest, cumin, salt, and ground black pepper in a bowl.
3. Cut cauliflower stem flush with the rest of the head so it can stay upright in a casserole dish. Spread butter mixture evenly over the top and sides of cauliflower, place in a casserole dish, and cover with foil.
4. Roast in the preheated oven until tender and cooked through, about 1 1/4 hours. Transfer to a platter and spoon any liquid in the casserole dish over the cauliflower.
