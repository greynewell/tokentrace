## Ingredients

- oil for frying
- 2  eggs, beaten
- ¼ cup milk
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
- ½ (8 ounce) package panko bread crumbs
- ½ cup seasoned bread crumbs
- 1 pound halibut, cut into 2-inch squares

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Whisk eggs, milk, and flour together in a shallow bowl. Stir panko bread crumbs and seasoned bread crumbs together in another bowl.
3. Gently dip halibut into egg mixture, then press gently into bread crumbs to coat both sides. Place the breaded halibut, unstacked, onto a plate. Repeat with remaining halibut.
