## Ingredients

- ½ pound lean ground beef, or more to taste
- ½ small onion, minced
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- 1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 2 cups water
- 2 cups elbow macaroni
- 8 ounces reduced-fat processed cheese food (such as Velveeta®), cut into small pieces
