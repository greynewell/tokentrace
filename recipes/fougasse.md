## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
- 1 teaspoon active dry yeast
- 4 cups all-purpose flour
- ½ tablespoon dried basil
- ½ tablespoon ground savory
- ½ tablespoon dried thyme
- ½ tablespoon dried rosemary
- 2 tablespoons sea salt
- 4 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 tablespoons cornmeal

## Instructions

1. Pour water into a large bowl. Sprinkle yeast into water; let stand undisturbed until dissolved.
2. Mix together basil, savory, thyme, and rosemary in a small bowl.
3. Stir 1 cup flour, 1 tablespoon herb mixture, sea salt, and 2 tablespoons oil into yeast mixture until well blended. Mix in remaining flour, 1 cup at a time, until a thick and somewhat sticky dough forms.
4. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic. Form into a ball and place into an oiled bowl. Flip dough to coat the surface. Cover the bowl with a clean dish towel; let dough rise until doubled, about 1 hour.
5. Punch dough down and divide in half. Shape each piece into an irregular oval, about 1 1/2-inches thick. Sprinkle cornmeal over 2 baking sheets; transfer dough to the prepared baking sheets.
6. Brush each loaf with remaining olive oil; sprinkle remaining herbs on top. Make several slashes in bread, cutting through dough with a knife. Cover loaves with clean dish towels. Let rise again until dough begins to rise, about 20 minutes.
7. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (220 degrees C).
8. Place the baking sheet with loaves in the preheated oven. Quickly splash a small amount of water onto the oven floor to create steam, then close the oven door. Bake loaves until golden, about 20 minutes.
