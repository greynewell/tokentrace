## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
- ¼ teaspoon dried parsley flakes
- ⅛ teaspoon seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®)
- 2 large (blank)s lobster tails
- 2 bamboo skewers
- 1 teaspoon olive oil
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- lemon wedges for serving

## Instructions

1. Whisk melted butter, parsley, and seafood seasoning together in a bowl. Refrigerate until ready to use.
2. Preheat an outdoor grill to medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
3. Using kitchen shears, cut the top portion of each lobster shell lengthwise down the middle. Crack shells open to expose meat. Separate meat from sides of shell. Insert a skewer in each tail lengthwise (this will prevent curling as it is grilled). Brush 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil on the exposed meat of each tail. Season with salt and pepper.
4. Place tails on the grill grate, flesh-side down, and grill for 6 minutes. Using tongs, flip tails, and spoon reserved seasoned butter over the top. Grill for 4 minutes more. Serve with lemon wedges.
