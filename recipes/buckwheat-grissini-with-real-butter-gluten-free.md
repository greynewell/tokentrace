## Ingredients

- ⅓ cup buckwheat flour
- ⅓ cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
- ¼ cup gluten-free all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons butter, divided
- 1 tablespoon black sesame seeds
- 1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves
- 3 tablespoons water, or more as needed

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Mix buckwheat flour, Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, gluten-free flour, and 1 1/2 tablespoon butter in a bowl with your hands until the mixture resembles small pebbles. Mix in sesame seeds and thyme. Add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the mixture pulls together into a soft dough.
3. Divide dough into 6 portions. Let dough rest for 5 minutes.
4. Roll each portion of dough into a long, thin stick about 6 to 7 inches long. Arrange side by side on the baking sheet. Brush remaining 1 1/2 teaspoon butter over dough.
