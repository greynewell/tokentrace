## Ingredients

- 1 (16 ounce) box tagliatelle pasta
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 3 ½ ounces crumbled blue cheese
- ⅔ teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice
- 1 pinch salt
- 1 pinch ground black pepper
- 1 pinch ground white pepper  (Optional)
- 1 pinch ground nutmeg
- 1 pinch dried oregano
- 1 pinch dried basil
- 1 tablespoon toasted walnuts, chopped

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Boil the tagliatelle until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, heat cream in a saucepan over low heat until warm; stir in blue cheese, lemon juice, garlic powder, nutmeg, oregano, basil, salt, white pepper, and black pepper. Cook very gently until blue cheese has melted and sauce is hot; make sure the sauce doesn't boil.

4. Pour blue cheese sauce over tagliatelle. Top with walnuts to serve.
