## Ingredients

- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 cups white sugar
- 1 ½ cups vegetable oil
- 3 large eggs
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 ½ cups diced apples
- 1 cup chopped pecans
- ¾ cup dried cranberries
- 1 cup light brown sugar
- ½ cup butter
- ¼ cup milk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ½ teaspoon salt

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a tube pan.
2. Place flour, white sugar, oil, eggs, vanilla extract, baking soda, and salt in a mixing bowl. Beat using an electric mixer until smooth. Stir in apple, pecans, and cranberries until well blended. Pour batter into the prepared pan.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven and set aside.
4. Combine brown sugar, butter, and milk in a small saucepan. Bring mixture to a rolling boil over high heat; continue to boil, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in vanilla extract and salt.
5. Pour glaze over the hot cake. Let cake sit in the pan to cool and for glaze to set, about 2 hours.
6. Remove cake from the pan. Place onto a plate, top-up; the glaze may puddle around the bottom edge of the cake. Serve when completely cool.
