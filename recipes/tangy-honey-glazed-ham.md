## Ingredients

- 1 (10 pound) fully-cooked, bone-in ham
- 1 ¼ cups packed dark brown sugar
- ⅓ cup pineapple juice
- ⅓ cup honey
- ⅓ large orange, juiced and zested
- 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
- ¼ teaspoon ground cloves

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Place ham in a roasting pan.
2. Bake ham, uncovered, in the preheated oven for 2 hours.
3. While the ham is baking, combine brown sugar, pineapple juice, and 1/3 cup honey in a saucepan. Zest orange into the saucepan, then squeeze in the juice. Add Dijon mustard and ground cloves; whisk mixture over medium-high heat as it comes to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until glaze thickens slightly, 5 to 10 minutes.
4. Taste glaze and adjust seasonings. Add lemon juice for more tang, or honey to make it sweeter. Set aside.
5. Remove ham from the oven after it has baked for 2 hours. Brush with glaze. Bake for an additional 30 to 45 minutes, brushing ham with glaze every 10 minutes.
