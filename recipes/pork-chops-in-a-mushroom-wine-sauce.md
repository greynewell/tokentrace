## Ingredients

- 6  pork chops
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 small onion, diced
- 1 (10.75 ounce) can  cream of mushroom soup
- 1 cup dry white wine
- 1 (8 ounce) package sliced mushrooms, cleaned

## Instructions

1. Heat a fry pan to medium-high. Season the pork chops on both sides with salt and pepper. Quickly brown the pork chops in the pan, 3 to 4 minutes per side. No need to cook them all the way, as they'll finish cooking in the oven. Remove them from the pan and set aside.
2. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
3. Leave the juices from the browned pork chops in the pan. Add the diced onion and saute until tender, about 5 minutes. Add the soup, white wine, and mushrooms. Stir until mixed. Remove from heat.
4. Add the browned pork chops, and any juices that may have accumulated, back into the pan with the sauce. Spoon some sauce on top of the pork chops. Cover and place in the oven; bake for about 45 minutes. Take the lid off and bake an additional 15 minutes. Serve with the sauce.
