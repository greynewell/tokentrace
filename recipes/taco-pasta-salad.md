## Ingredients

- 2 cups spiral pasta
- 1 pound ground beef
- 1 (1.25 ounce) package taco seasoning
- 3 cups shredded lettuce
- 2 cups halved cherry tomatoes
- 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
- ½ cup chopped onion
- ½ cup French salad dressing
- 1 (7 ounce) bag corn chips

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spiral pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain.
