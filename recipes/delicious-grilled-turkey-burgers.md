## Ingredients

- 1 pound 93% lean ground turkey
- 2 tablespoons chopped red onion
- 2 tablespoons sour cream
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- 1 teaspoon Montreal steak seasoning
- 1 tablespoon olive oil, or to taste
- salt to taste
- 4 thin slices  Swiss cheese
- 4  Hawaiian-style hamburger buns

## Instructions

1. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
2. Combine turkey, red onion, sour cream, mustard, and steak seasoning in a bowl until well mixed. Form into four 3/4-inch thick patties. Drizzle with olive oil on both sides and season with salt.
3. Cook on the preheated grill until cooked through, about 5 minutes per side, laying Swiss cheese over burgers just before removing from the grill. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the burgers should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
