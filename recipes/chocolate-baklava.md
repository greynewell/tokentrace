## Ingredients

- 1 pound pecans, finely chopped
- 8 ounces dark chocolate (such as Callebaut®), finely chopped
- ¾ cup white sugar
- 1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 1 pound phyllo dough, thawed
- 1 ¼ cups unsalted butter, melted
- ¾ cup orange juice
- ½ cup honey
- ½ cup water
- ½ cup white sugar
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 2 ounces semisweet chocolate
- 1 teaspoon butter

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 10x14-inch baking pan with butter.
2. Mix pecans, dark chocolate, 3/4 cup sugar, and cinnamon in a bowl.
3. Trim phyllo dough to fit prepared baking pan. Layer 8 sheets of phyllo dough in prepared baking pan, brushing each sheet with melted butter; sprinkle with 2 cups pecan mixture. Spread butter on 4 more sheets of phyllo and layer over pecans; sprinkle with 2 more cups pecans. Repeat layers with 4 more sheets of phyllo and remaining pecans. Pour any leftover butter over baklava.
4. Cut through the top few layers of phyllo lengthwise, leaving bottom layer intact, to create 4 long rows. Make evenly-spaced zigzag cuts along each row to create 48 small triangles, again leaving bottom layer of phyllo intact.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until phyllo dough is golden brown and flaky, about 1 hour; immediately finish cutting through to bottom layer of baklava.
6. Bring orange juice, honey, water, 1/2 cup sugar, and lemon juice to a boil in a saucepan; reduce heat to medium and simmer until thickened, about 20 minutes. Pour sauce over baklava.
7. Melt remaining 2 ounces semisweet chocolate and 1 teaspoon butter in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching.
8. Drizzle chocolate over baklava. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.
