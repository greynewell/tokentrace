## Ingredients

- ½ cup bulgur
- ½ cup hot water
- ½ teaspoon dried mint
- ¼ teaspoon ground allspice
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ⅛ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1  onion, minced
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
- 1 pound ground lamb
- 2 tablespoons pine nuts

## Instructions

1. Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8 inch square baking dish.
2. Soak bulgur in hot water until the bulgur expands and cools, about 10 minutes. Place the bulgur, mint, allspice, pepper, cinnamon, salt, onion, parsley, and lamb in a food processor. Process until well mixed, about 1 minute. Divide the lamb mixture and layer half in the baking dish, creating a large patty. Sprinkle pine nuts over the meat, then layer the remaining lamb on top, patting firmly. Cut the kibbee into 1 1/2 inch squares.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until the lamb is no longer pink in the middle, 30 to 35 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
