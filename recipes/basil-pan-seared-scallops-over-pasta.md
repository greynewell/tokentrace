## Ingredients

- 1 (16 ounce) package farfalle (bow tie) pasta
- 24  scallops, rinsed and drained
- ¾ cup olive oil
- ¼ cup lemon juice
- 1 ½ teaspoons dried minced garlic
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons dried basil
- 9 tablespoons whipped butter

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook pasta in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes, or until al dente. Drain, rinse, and transfer to a large serving bowl.
2. Meanwhile, place scallops in a large bowl. In a small bowl, mix together 1/4 cup olive oil, lemon juice, 1 teaspoon garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and the black pepper. Pour mixture over scallops. Arrange scallops in a single layer in a large baking dish or plate. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon dried basil over scallops so that only one side is sparsely coated with basil.
3. Heat a large skillet over medium-high, and melt one tablespoon of butter in the pan. Place 12 scallops basil-side down, and cook for about 3 to 4 minutes until dark golden brown. Turn scallops, and cook the other side. Cook the remaining 12 scallops the same way.
4. In a small saucepan, melt remaining butter with 1/2 cup olive oil, 1 tablespoon basil, 1/2 teaspoon garlic, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
5. Toss pasta with butter and olive oil mixture. Divide pasta onto plates, and top with scallops.
