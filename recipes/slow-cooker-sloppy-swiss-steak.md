## Ingredients

- 2 pounds boneless beef round steak, cut into 6-ounce pieces
- ½ teaspoon seasoned salt (such as LAWRY'S®), or to taste
- ½ teaspoon paprika, or to taste
- ⅔ cup all-purpose flour

## Instructions

1. Sprinkle both sides of the steak pieces with seasoned salt and paprika.

6. Mix together the diced tomatoes with green chiles, sloppy joe sauce, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, and wine, and pour over the steak and vegetables.
