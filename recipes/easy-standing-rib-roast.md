## Ingredients

- 1 (4 pound) rib roast
- 2 tablespoons olive oil, or as needed
- ¼ cup sea salt
- 2 tablespoons freshly ground black pepper
- 2 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C).
2. Brush rib roast lightly with olive oil. Rub sea salt, black pepper, and garlic into the roast. Place fatty-side up on a rack set inside a shallow pan.
