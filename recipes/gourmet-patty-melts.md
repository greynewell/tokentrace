## Ingredients

- 1 pound ground sirloin
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- 2 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 medium onions, sliced
- cooking spray
- 4 slices Cheddar cheese
- 4 teaspoons Dijon mustard  (Optional)
- 8 slices rye bread, lightly toasted

## Instructions

1. Mix sirloin, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, salt, and pepper together by hand in a medium bowl. Form into 4 hamburger patties and wrap in plastic wrap. Place in the refrigerator until flavors have melded, 4 hours to overnight.
2. Heat butter and olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat until melted. Add onions and saute until they begin to caramelize, about 15 minutes, reducing heat to medium-low if they seem to be sizzling too much.
3. Spray a large skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium heat. Place hamburger patties in the skillet and cook for 3 minutes per side, topping each patty with a slice of Cheddar cheese after flipping.
4. Place patties on toasted rye bread. Top with warm onions, Dijon mustard, and remaining bread.
