## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- ½ cup butter, softened
- ½ cup vegetable oil
- 1 ½ cups white sugar
- 3  eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 3 cups peeled, seeded and chopped mango
- ½ cup raisins
- ½ cup chopped walnuts
- ½ cup shredded coconut

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease two 9x5-inch loaf pans.
2. Sift together flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon in a medium bowl. Set aside.
3. Beat together butter, oil, and sugar in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Stir in eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in vanilla. Add flour mixture and mix just until combined. Fold in mango, raisins, walnuts, and coconut, mixing just enough to evenly combine. Transfer batter to the prepared pans and let stand for 20 minutes.
