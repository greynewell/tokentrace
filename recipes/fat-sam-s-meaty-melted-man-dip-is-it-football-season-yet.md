## Ingredients

- 1 pound pork breakfast sausage
- 2 (1.25 ounce) packages taco seasoning mix, divided
- 3 cups water, divided
- 2 pounds processed cheese food, cubed
- 1 tablespoon Louisiana-style hot sauce

## Instructions

1. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain in a colander and discard grease. Transfer sausage to a large saucepan.
2. Stir 1 package taco seasoning into sausage and cook over medium heat until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Add 2 cups water and remaining package taco seasoning. Stir until seasoning is dissolved; simmer for 5 minutes more. Reduce heat to low.
