## Ingredients

- 1 head green cabbage, cut into bite-size pieces
- 1 pound ground beef
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon dried parsley
- ¼ teaspoon onion powder
- ⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 2 cups water
- 1 cup white rice
- 1 (10.75 ounce) can  condensed tomato soup (such as Campbell's®)
- 1 (32 ounce) container crushed tomatoes (such as Hunt's®)

## Instructions

1. Boil cabbage in a stockpot until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain well.
2. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Mix salt, parsley, onion powder, and black pepper into ground beef.

4. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
5. Combine cabbage, seasoned ground beef, rice, and tomato mixture together in a bowl; transfer to a 9x13-inch baking dish.
