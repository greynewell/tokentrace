## Ingredients

- 4 ounces cream cheese, softened
- 1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
- 2  fresh jalapeno peppers, seeded and minced
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 tablespoon barbecue seasoning
- 2 (8 ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 6 strips thinly sliced bacon

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Combine cream cheese, Cheddar cheese, jalapenos, garlic powder, and barbecue seasoning in a bowl. Mix well until evenly combined.
3. Cut a deep pocket into each chicken breast, being careful not to cut all the way through to the other side. Fill the pocket of each chicken breast with cream cheese mixture. Wrap each chicken breast with 3 slices of bacon.
4. Place a baking rack on top of a baking sheet and place stuffed chicken on top of the rack.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove from oven and let rest for 5 minutes before serving.40
