## Ingredients

- 2 cups panko bread crumbs
- 1 tablespoon parsley flakes
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 (1 pound) pork tenderloin, cut crosswise into 1/2-inch thick slices
- ¼ cup olive oil

## Instructions

1. Stir panko bread crumbs, parsley flakes, garlic powder, onion powder, and black pepper together in a bowl. Dip tenderloin slices in the crumb mixture to coat both sides.
2. Heat olive oil over medium-high heat in a skillet and fry the pork until the crumb coating is browned and the pork is no longer pink inside, 2 to 3 minutes per side. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the center of the pork should read at least 145 degrees F (65 degrees C).
