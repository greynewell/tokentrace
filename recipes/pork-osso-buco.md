## Ingredients

- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 6  thick-cut pork shank sections, 2 to 3 inches thick
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1 large yellow onion, diced
- 1 large carrot, diced
- 2  ribs celery, diced
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- ¼ cup tomato paste
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 cup white wine
- 2 cups chicken broth
- 1  bay leaf
- ½ teaspoon dried thyme
- ½ teaspoon dried rosemary
- ⅛ teaspoon ground cloves
- Chopped Italian parsley
- Freshly grated lemon zest

## Instructions

1. Salt and pepper both sides of pork shank sections.
2. Heat oil and butter in a heavy pot over high heat. Brown pork until it gets a nice sear, 3 or 4 minutes per side. Transfer pork to a plate; reduce heat to medium. Add onions, carrots, and celery to pot. Sprinkle with salt. Cook and stir until onions start to turn translucent. Add tomato paste; cook and stir until tomato paste starts to caramelize, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle in flour; stir for 2 minutes. Add white wine and raise heat to medium high.
3. When sauce comes to a simmer, cook until sauce reduces slightly. Add bay leaf, thyme, rosemary, and ground cloves. Add chicken stock and return to a simmer. Transfer pork back to pot along with any accumulated juices. Bring mixture to a very slow simmer. Cover and cook until fork tender, 3 to 3 1/2 hours.
4. Serve shanks with plenty of sauce, topped with freshly chopped parsley and a sprinkle of lemon zest.
