## Ingredients

- 2 cups flour
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 2  eggs
- ½ teaspoon water, or as needed
- 2  onions, peeled
- ½ pound ground beef
- salt and pepper to taste
- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 tablespoon red pepper flakes
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic
- 1 (8 ounce) container plain yogurt

## Instructions

1. Combine flour and salt in a mixing bowl. Add eggs and water, mixing well with your hands. Add more water, if needed, to form a soft dough. Cover and set aside for at least 30 minutes.
2. Shred onions and place them in a colander or sieve set over a bowl; drain and discard juice. Combine drained onion, ground beef, salt, and pepper in a large bowl; mix well with a spoon until mashed. Set filling aside.
3. Lightly flour a work surface and a large plate.
4. Divide dough in half. Working with one piece at a time, roll dough on the floured surface into a rectangle, as thin as you can. Cut into 2-inch squares with a knife or pastry wheel.
5. Place about 2 teaspoons meat filling in the center of each square. Gather the edges of dough and pinch them together at the top to form a bundle. Transfer manti to the prepared plate; sprinkle more flour on top to prevent sticking.
6. Heat oil and red pepper flakes in a small skillet over low heat just until pepper flakes begin to color oil. Remove from heat and keep warm. Stir together yogurt and minced garlic in a small bowl and set aside.
7. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook manti in boiling water until filling is no longer pink and dough is tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain well.
8. Divide manti onto 4 plates. Spoon yogurt sauce over manti and drizzle each serving with warm red pepper oil.
