## Ingredients

- 1 cup white sugar
- 3 tablespoons cornstarch
- 1 cup cold water
- 1 (21 ounce) can cherry pie filling
- ½ teaspoon almond extract
- 4 cups chopped fresh rhubarb
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 cup rolled oats
- 1 cup packed brown sugar
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ½ cup margarine or butter

## Instructions

1. Stir sugar and cornstarch together in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in cold water and cook, stirring constantly, until thick and bubbly. Stir in cherry pie filling and almond extract. Set aside to cool.
2. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
