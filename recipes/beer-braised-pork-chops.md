## Ingredients

- 4 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 4  boneless pork chops, 1/2-inch thick
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 cup beer
- 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
- 2 tablespoons stone ground mustard
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh rosemary

## Instructions

1. Combine flour, salt, and pepper in a large resealable plastic bag. Add pork chops and shake well to coat thoroughly.
2. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add olive oil and heat until sizzling. Add pork chops in a single layer. Saute until browned on one side, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Turn pork chops over and cook for an additional 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Transfer pork chops to a plate.
3. Add beer, vinegar, mustard, brown sugar, and rosemary to the skillet and mix well. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Return pork chops to the skillet, cover, and reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer until pork chops are no longer pink in the center, 10 to 12 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
4. Transfer pork chops to a plate. Increase heat to medium and boil pan juices in the skillet until thickened, whisking often, about 3 minutes. Top pork chops with sauce.
