## Ingredients

- 1 (1 1/2 pound) beef tri tip roast, trimmed
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- 1 teaspoon dried marjoram
- 1 teaspoon dry mustard
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ⅓ cup red wine
- 1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Rub beef all over with thyme, basil, marjoram, dry mustard, salt, and black pepper; transfer into a resealable plastic bag. Seal the bag and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight. Pour red wine into the bag 4 hours before cooking.
2. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Drizzle olive oil over the bottom of a roasting pan; transfer beef into the prepared roasting pan.
3. Roast in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue roasting until slightly pink in the center, 20 to 25 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C).
4. Let rest for 5 to 10 minutes before thinly slicing against the grain.
