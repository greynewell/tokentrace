## Ingredients

- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 3 teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¾ cup white sugar
- ½ cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
- ¼ cup shortening
- 4 large eggs
- 2 tablespoons lemon extract
- 1 ½ cups confectioners' sugar
- 4 tablespoons milk, or more as needed
- 1 teaspoon lemon extract
- 2 tablespoons multicolored candy sprinkles, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl.
2. Cream sugar, butter, and shortening together in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Add eggs. Beat in lemon extract. Add flour mixture gradually, beating well to combine. Wrap dough in waxed paper and refrigerate for 1 hour.
3. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 baking sheets.
4. Place the dough on a lightly-floured surface. Break off golf ball-sized pieces of dough. Roll each piece into a rope about 7 inches long and 1/2 inch in diameter. Tie into a knot with one end poking up in the center. Place 1-inch apart on the prepared baking sheets.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes.
6. While cookies bake, combine confectioners' sugar, milk, and lemon extract in a bowl for icing until smooth.
7. Transfer baked cookies to a wire rack to cool slightly, about 5 minutes. Spread icing evenly on top of the slightly warm cookies and add sprinkles.
