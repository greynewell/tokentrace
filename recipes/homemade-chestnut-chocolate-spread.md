## Ingredients

- 1 cup milk, or more as needed
- ½ cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 cups roasted and peeled chestnuts
- ½ cup honey

## Instructions

1. Mix milk, cocoa powder, sugar, and vanilla extract in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a simmer. Add chestnuts; cook until chestnuts soften and milk has reduced by a little more than half, about 10 minutes.
2. Carefully pour milk mixture into a blender. Cover and hold lid down with a potholder; blend until smooth. Add extra milk, a few tablespoons at a time, if mixture isn't blending well. Avoid adding too much milk as the spread should be thick.
3. Add honey and continue to blend until smooth. Transfer to small jars and let cool. Serve immediately or seal jars and store in the refrigerator.
