## Ingredients

- 1 ¾ cups heavy whipping cream
- ¼ cup whole milk
- ½ cup white sugar
- 1 ¼ cups semisweet chocolate chips, divided
- 1 large egg
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 4 cups French bread, with crust, cut into 1-inch cubes
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 1 cup prepared chocolate sauce, warmed

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
2. Combine cream, milk, and 1/2 cup sugar in a heavy saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium-low heat, stirring until sugar dissolves, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat, add 1 cup chocolate chips and whisk until melted and smooth.
3. Whisk egg and vanilla extract together in a large bowl to blend. Gradually whisk in hot chocolate mixture. Set custard aside to cool, stirring often, for about 10 minutes.
4. Add bread cubes and remaining chocolate chips to the custard and toss to coat. Transfer to a 1 1/2-quart shallow oval baking dish. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons sugar over the pudding.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until custard thickens and center is just set, about 50 minutes.
6. Serve pudding warm, drizzled with warm chocolate sauce.
