## Ingredients

- 1 ¾ cups whole wheat flour
- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- ⅓ cup vegetable oil
- 1 cup water
- salt for sprinkling

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. In a medium bowl, stir together whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, and 3/4 teaspoon salt. Pour in vegetable oil and water; mix until just blended.
3. Roll dough out on a lightly floured surface to a thickness of 1/8 inch or less. Place dough on an ungreased baking sheet, and mark squares out with a knife, but don't cut through. Prick each cracker with a fork a few times, and sprinkle with salt.
4. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until crisp and light brown. Cool on the baking sheet, then separate into individual crackers.
