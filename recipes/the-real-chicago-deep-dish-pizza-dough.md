## Ingredients

- 2 ¼ teaspoons active dry yeast
- 1 ½ teaspoons white sugar
- 1 ⅛ cups warm water - 110 to 115 degrees F (43 to 45 degrees C)
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- ½ cup corn oil
- 1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt

## Instructions

1. Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water in a bowl. Let stand for 5 to 10 minutes until the yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam.
