## Ingredients

- 1 ½ pounds bottom round steak, 1 inch thick and trimmed of fat
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons avocado oil, divided, or as needed
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- ½ cup carrot, chopped
- ½ cup chopped celery
- 1  green bell pepper, chopped  (Optional)
- 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- ¼ cup Merlot wine
- 2 ¾ cups canned chopped Italian-style tomatoes in juice
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon oregano
- 1 teaspoon paprika

## Instructions

1. Dry steak well with paper towels and cut into four 4-inch pieces. Season with salt and pepper.
2. Place flour into a shallow bowl. Dredge steak pieces in flour, shaking off excess.
3. Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and select Saute function. Once the pot is hot, add 1 tablespoon avocado oil. Brown the steak in batches, so you don't crowd the pot, 2 minutes per side. Transfer browned meat to a warm plate and set aside.
4. Add 1 tablespoon of avocado oil to the pot and cook onion, carrot, celery, and bell pepper until onions are soft and translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Deglaze the pot with Merlot. Mix in tomatoes, Worcestershire sauce, 1 teaspoon salt, oregano, and paprika. Return steak to the pot and push down into the tomato mixture.
5. Close and lock the lid. Select manual pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 30 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
6. Allow pressure to release naturally according to manufacturer's instructions for 5 minutes. Carefully open the valve to release the remaining pressure, about 5 minutes more. Unlock and remove the lid.
