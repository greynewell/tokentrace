## Ingredients

- ½ cup butter
- ½ cup all-purpose flour
- 3 cups milk
- 6 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
- 1  egg, beaten
- 2 tablespoons heavy cream
- salt and pepper to taste
- 2 pounds sliced roasted turkey
- 1  tomato, thinly sliced
- 8 slices white bread, toasted
- ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 8 slices crispy bacon

## Instructions

1. Make sauce: Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in flour; cook and stir until it begins to brown slightly. Gradually whisk in milk so that no lumps form; bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Mix in Parmesan cheese and stir in beaten egg to thicken; remove from heat and stir in cream.
2. Preheat the oven's broiler.
3. Make sandwiches: For each hot brown, place two slices toast into the bottom of an individual-sized casserole dish. Cover with a liberal amount of roasted turkey and tomato slices. Season with salt and pepper; spoon sauce over top of each one and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
4. Place the dishes under the preheated broiler and cook until speckled brown on top, about 5 minutes. Remove and arrange two slices bacon in a cross shape on top of each sandwich.
