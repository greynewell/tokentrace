## Ingredients

- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature
- ¾ cup sugar
- 4 medium eggs
- 7 ounces almond meal
- 2 cups cherimoya pulp, seeds removed (about 2 small cherimoya)
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ¼ cup sliced almonds
- 2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch round cake pan.
2. Combine butter and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment; beat until smooth and creamy. Add eggs, 1 at a time, and beat until well combined. Add almond flour and mix until smooth. Fold in cherimoya pulp and cinnamon. Pour batter into the prepared cake pan.
3. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Top cake with sliced almonds and continue baking until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 15 more minutes.
4. Cool cake on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Run a table knife around the edges to loosen and invert carefully onto a serving plate or cooling rack. Let cool completely. Dust cooled cake with confectioners' sugar to serve.
