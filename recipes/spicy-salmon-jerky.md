## Ingredients

- 3 pounds salmon fillet, skin removed
- 1 cup soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons molasses
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 1 ½ tablespoons ground black pepper
- 2 teaspoons liquid smoke flavoring
- 12 dashes hot sauce (such as Tabasco®), or more to taste

## Instructions

1. Slice salmon fillets into 4 equal sections, width-wise. Rotate each section 90 degrees and slice lengthwise, about 1/4-inch thick. Remove pin bones with needle-nose pliers. Don't slice bony sections near the center of the fillet.
2. Stir soy sauce, molasses, sugar, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, black pepper, liquid smoke, and hot sauce together in a glass or plastic bowl until marinade is well-mixed. Place salmon in the marinade, ensuring every strip is covered. Cover bowl and refrigerate for 4 hours.
3. Remove salmon from bowl and drain liquid using a colander. Pat the salmon dry using paper towels.
4. Place each salmon strip in a dehydrator and run the dehydrator according to manufacturer's instructions until desired doneness is reached, about 6 hours. Check every few hours for doneness.
