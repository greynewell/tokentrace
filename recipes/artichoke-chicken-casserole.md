## Ingredients

- 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 cup light mayonnaise
- 1 pinch garlic powder, or to taste
- 4 (4 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- 1 (14 ounce) can artichoke hearts, drained

2. Mix Parmesan cheese, mayonnaise, and garlic powder together in a bowl.
3. Arrange chicken breasts in a 9x13-inch baking dish; top with artichoke hearts and crimini mushrooms. Spread cheese mixture over the artichoke and mushroom layer.
