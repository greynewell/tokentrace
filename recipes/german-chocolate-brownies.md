## Ingredients

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ½ cup unsalted butter
- 4 (1 ounce) squares sweet baking chocolate (such as Baker's German's Sweet Chocolate®), broken into pieces
- ½ cup white sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 large eggs, beaten
- ½ cup brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
- 2 tablespoons corn syrup
- 2 tablespoons milk
- 1 cup flaked coconut
- ½ cup finely chopped pecans

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Butter an 8- or 9-inch square glass baking pan.
2. Mix flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl.
3. Melt butter in a saucepan over low heat. Add chocolate and stir until melted. Remove from the heat and cool for 10 minutes or more.
4. Combine cooled chocolate mixture, sugar, and vanilla extract in a bowl. Add eggs; mix well. Add flour mixture and stir until well combined. Spread batter into the prepared baking pan.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and set the oven to broil.
6. Combine brown sugar, melted butter, corn syrup, and milk for topping in a bowl. Stir in coconut and pecans. Drop and gently spread mixture evenly over the warm brownies.
7. Broil 4 inches from the heat until topping is bubbly, 1 to 2 minutes. Cool for 1 hour before slicing and serving.
