## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 1 (18.5 ounce) package yellow cake mix
- 2 (3.9 ounce) packages instant vanilla pudding mix
- 1 cup chopped walnuts, divided
- 1 cup Irish whiskey, divided
- ½ cup milk
- ½ cup vegetable oil
- 4 large eggs
- ½ cup butter
- 1 cup brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon water

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease 6 mini loaf pans with cooking spray.
2. Combine cake mix, pudding mixes, and 1/2 cup walnuts in a large bowl.
3. Whisk 1/2 cup Irish whiskey, milk, and oil together in a separate bowl. Whisk in eggs. Pour over cake mixture and stir until blended. Divide batter among the prepared loaf pans.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes.
5. Meanwhile, melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in brown sugar. Add remaining walnuts, 1 tablespoon whiskey, and water. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until smooth, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and whisk in remaining whiskey.
6. Cool cakes for 5 minutes before inverting a wire rack set over a baking sheet. Use a toothpick to poke small holes across the tops. Pour whiskey topping over cakes and leave to soak in as they cool.
