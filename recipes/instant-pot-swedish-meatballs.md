## Ingredients

- 1 ¼ pounds lean ground turkey
- 1 large egg, beaten
- 3 tablespoons panko bread crumbs
- 1 teaspoon granulated onion
- ½ teaspoon granulated garlic
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 pinch ground allspice
- 1 pinch ground nutmeg
- 2 tablespoons salted butter
- 1 ½ tablespoons olive oil
- 1 ¼ cups beef broth
- ¾ cup half-and-half, divided
- ½ teaspoon Dijon mustard
- 1 ½ teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
- 2 tablespoons sour cream
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley

## Instructions

1. Combine ground turkey, egg, bread crumbs, onion, garlic, salt, pepper, allspice, and nutmeg in a large bowl; mix until well combined. Use a spring-hinged scoop to form about 12 meatballs.
2. Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and select Saute function. Add butter and oil; heat until butter is melted. Cook meatballs in the hot fat until browned on all sides, about 4 minutes. Work in batches if necessary. Transfer browned meatballs to a shallow dish and loosely cover with foil.
3. Pour broth into the pot and scrape off all the browned bits from the bottom of the pot using a wooden spoon. Mix in 1/2 cup half-and-half, Dijon mustard, and Worcestershire sauce. Return meatballs to the pot and coat with the sauce.
4. Cancel Saute mode. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 5 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
5. Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, for 7 minutes. Release remaining pressure carefully using the quick-release method, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Transfer meatballs carefully to a shallow dish and cover loosely with foil.
6. Whisk together remaining 1/4 cup half-and-half, sour cream, and flour in a small bowl. Stir into the pot and simmer until thickened, 3 to 5 minutes. Serve meatballs with sauce and garnish with parsley.
