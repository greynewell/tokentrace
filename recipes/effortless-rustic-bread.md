## Ingredients

- 3 cups warm water
- 1 ½ tablespoons active dry yeast
- 1 ½ tablespoons coarse salt
- 6 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- ½ cup cornmeal

## Instructions

1. Mix water, yeast, and salt together in a large bowl. Let stand until mixture becomes foamy, about 10 minutes.
2. Stir flour into yeast mixture until well incorporated; the dough will be loose and look wet. Cover bowl loosely with a damp towel and let sit for about 5 hours.
3. Shape dough into 2 loaves using damp hands. Place loaves on a cornmeal-dusted work surface and score tops a few times with a sharp knife. Transfer to a baking sheet and allow loaves to double in size, 30 to 60 minutes.
4. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
5. Bake loaves in the preheated oven, spraying surface of dough occasionally with water, until golden brown, about 20 minutes.
