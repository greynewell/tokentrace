## Ingredients

- 2 (10 ounce) porterhouse steaks
- kosher salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 4 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- ½ cup olive oil, divided
- ¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 1 medium lemon, cut into quarters

## Instructions

1. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Season steaks with salt and pepper.
2. Cook steaks on the preheated grill until they are beginning to firm and are hot and slightly pink in the center, about 12 to 14 minutes, flipping halfway. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C) for medium.
3. While the steaks are cooking, place garlic in a microwave-safe bowl. Sprinkle some salt over top and pour in 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Mash garlic with the back of a sturdy knife into a fine paste. Stir in remaining oil and red pepper flakes. Heat in the microwave until hot, about 1 to 1 1/2 minutes, mixing every 30 seconds.
4. Remove steaks from the oven and let sit covered for 4 to 5 minutes. Drizzle 2 tablespoons oil mixture over each steak and squeeze lemon wedges over top.
