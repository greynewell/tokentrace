## Ingredients

- 4 slices bacon
- ½ small onion, chopped
- 3 cups shredded, cooked chicken breast meat
- ⅔ cup barbeque sauce
- 1 (10 ounce) can refrigerated pizza crust dough
- 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels; crumble.
3. Add shredded chicken and onion to hot bacon grease in the pan. Cook and stir over medium heat until onion is tender. Stir in 1/3 cup barbeque sauce; remove from heat. Mix in crumbled bacon.
4. Roll pizza crust dough onto a greased cookie sheet. Press out to an even thickness, then cut in half. Divide chicken mixture between dough pieces, spreading over 1/2 of each dough piece to within 1/2 inch of the edge.
5. Drizzle remaining barbeque sauce over the filling. Sprinkle with cheese and cilantro. Fold uncovered portion of dough over the filling. Press the edges together with a fork to seal.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until browned, about 25 minutes. Cool for a few minutes, then cut each calzone in half for 4 servings. Serve with additional barbeque sauce if desired.
