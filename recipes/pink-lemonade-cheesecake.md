## Ingredients

- 1 (16 ounce) package fresh strawberries, hulled and thinly sliced
- 1  lemon, zested and juiced, divided
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 2 cups crushed graham crackers
- 2 tablespoons butter, melted
- 2  eggs, separated
- ½ cup white sugar
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
- ½ cup frozen pink lemonade concentrate, thawed, undiluted
- 1 pinch salt
- 2 drops red food coloring, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
2. Place strawberries in a covered container. Coat with 1 tablespoon lemon juice. Add 2 tablespoons sugar and shake to coat. Place in the refrigerator. Save remaining lemon juice for another use.
3. Combine graham crackers and melted butter in a bowl. Mix until evenly moistened; press into the bottom and sides of an 8-inch pie pan.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until crust is firm, about 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool.
5. Meanwhile, beat egg whites in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl until foamy. Gradually add sugar, continuing to beat until stiff peaks form.
6. Combine cream cheese, lemonade concentrate, lemon zest, and salt in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until creamy. Add egg yolks, 1 at a time, blending well after each addition. Gently fold egg whites into the cream cheese mixture. Add food coloring until mixture is the desired shade of pink. Pour into the prepared pie crust.
7. Bake in the preheated oven until set in the center, 25 to 30 minutes. Set the pan on a wire rack, and allow the cheesecake to cool at room temperature, about 1 hour. Refrigerate until completely chilled, at least 2 hours.
8. Cover with the sliced strawberries. Chill 1 more hour before serving.
