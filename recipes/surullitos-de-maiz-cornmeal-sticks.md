## Ingredients

- 2 cups water
- 1 ¼ teaspoons salt
- 1 ½ cups yellow cornmeal
- 5 tablespoons white sugar, or to taste  (Optional)
- 4 ounces Edam cheese, shredded
- 2 cups oil for deep frying
- 1 cup ketchup
- 1 cup mayonnaise

## Instructions

1. Combine water and salt in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Remove from heat and stir in cornmeal and sugar. Return to medium heat; cook stirring constantly until mixture pulls away from the sides of the pan. Remove from heat and stir in Edam cheese until well blended.
2. Roll tablespoonfuls of cornmeal mixture into balls. Then roll balls into small fat sticks about 3 inches long. In a medium bowl, mix ketchup and mayonnaise to make a dipping sauce. Set aside.
3. Heat oil in a large heavy skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Carefully place some cornmeal sticks into hot oil so they are not crowded. Fry until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from hot oil and drain on paper towels. Serve immediately with dipping sauce.
