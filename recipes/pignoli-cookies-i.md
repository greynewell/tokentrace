## Ingredients

- 12 ounces almond paste
- ½ cup white sugar
- 1 cup confectioners' sugar
- 4  egg whites
- 1 ½ cups pine nuts

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line 2 cookie sheets with foil; lightly grease the foil with cooking spray.
2. Place almond paste and white sugar in a food processor; blend until combined. Add confectioners' sugar and 2 egg whites; blend until smooth.
3. Whisk remaining 2 egg whites in a small bowl. Place pine nuts on a shallow plate.
4. With lightly floured hands, roll dough into 1-inch balls. Coat balls in egg whites, shaking off excess, then roll in pine nuts, pressing lightly to stick. Arrange balls on cookie sheets, and flatten slightly to form a 1 1/2-inch round.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 15 to 18 minutes. Let stand on cookie sheets briefly, then transfer to a wire rack to cool.
