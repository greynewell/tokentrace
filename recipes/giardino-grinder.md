## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1  onion, sliced
- 2  eggplants, peeled and sliced into rings
- 2  zucchini, peeled and sliced
- 1 cup sliced mushrooms
- salt
- 2 tablespoons Marsala wine
- 3  ciabatta sandwich rolls, sliced horizontally
- 1/4 cup garlic basil spread (see footnote for recipe link)
- 1/4 cup garlic roasted tomato spread (see footnote for recipe link)
- 1/4 cup artichoke aioli (see footnote for recipe link)
- 1 pound shredded mozzarella cheese

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).
2. Heat olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Cook and stir onion until it begins to soften and turn translucent, about 5 minutes. Add eggplant and cook until they have absorbed some of the oil, about 1 minute. Stir zucchini into eggplant mixture and cook until softened, 1 to 2 minutes. Mix in mushrooms and salt; cook and stir until mushrooms are softened, 3 to 4 minutes.
3. Pour Marsala wine into eggplant mixture and bring to a boil, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Cook until wine has reduced slightly, 2 to 3 minutes.
4. Spread each ciabatta roll with 1 tablespoon garlic basil spread, 1 tablespoon garlic roasted tomato sauce, and 1 tablespoon artichoke aioli. Top with 1/4 pound mozzarella cheese. Evenly distribute the eggplant mixture among the 4 sandwiches.
5. Place sandwiches on a baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven until the cheese is melted and the bread is toasted, 3 to 4 minutes.
