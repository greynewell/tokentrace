## Ingredients

- 24  frozen ice cream sandwiches, divided
- 1 (16 ounce) jar crunchy peanut butter, divided
- 1 (3.9 ounce) package instant chocolate pudding mix
- 1 (16 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed
- 16  peanut butter cups, chopped, divided
- 1 (12 ounce) jar hot fudge ice cream topping, divided

## Instructions

1. Line the bottom of a 9x13-inch pan with 12 ice cream sandwiches.
2. Open the jar of peanut butter, place into microwave oven, and microwave on low power for about 30 seconds at a time, until the peanut butter is warm and spreads easily. Spread half the peanut butter over the layer of ice cream sandwiches.
