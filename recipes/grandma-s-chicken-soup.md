## Ingredients

- 1 (5 pound) whole chicken
- 1 pound carrots, peeled and sliced
- 1 pound celery, sliced
- 2  tomatoes, seeded and chopped
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 1 bunch fresh dill
- 1 tablespoon kosher salt
- 1 tablespoon ground black pepper

1. Clean chicken and remove some, but not all, fat. Place in a 2-quart soup pot with carrots, celery, tomatoes, and onion. Tie all dill sprigs into a bunch with kitchen string; add to the pot with salt and pepper. Add water until chicken is covered by 2 inches.
