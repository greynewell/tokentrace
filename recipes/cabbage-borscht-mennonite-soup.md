## Ingredients

- 2 pounds beef soup bones
- 2 quarts water, or more as needed
- 12  carrots, chopped
- 6  potatoes, cubed
- 1 head cabbage, finely chopped
- 3  onions, minced
- 1 ½ tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
- 10  whole allspice berries
- 1  bay leaf
- ½  star anise
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 pinch ground black pepper
- 1 ½ cups chopped tomato

## Instructions

1. Bring beef soup bones and water to a boil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Reduce heat and simmer for 1 1/2 hours, adding more water, as necessary, to maintain the 2 quart level. Remove and discard the soup bones, then strain the broth into a fresh pot, and return to the stove.
2. Stir in the carrots, potatoes, cabbage, onions, parsley, allspice berries, bay leaf, star anise, salt, and pepper. Cook until the potatoes are easily pierced with a fork, about 20 minutes. Stir in tomatoes and return soup to a boil. Serve individual bowls of soup topped with heavy cream.
