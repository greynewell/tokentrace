## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
- 2 cups white sugar
- ½ cup milk
- ½ cup butter
- 3 cups quick cooking oats
- ½ cup crunchy peanut butter
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper.
2. Stir together oats, coconut, peanut butter, and vanilla in a large bowl with a spatula until well combined.
3. Combine sugar, milk, butter, and cocoa powder in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir occasionally and gradually bring mixture to a boil. Then, stir constantly and boil for no longer than 90 to 120 seconds; if it boils for too long the cookies will turn out crumbly. Remove from the heat and pour over the oat mixture; stir until well combined.
4. Drop large scoops batter onto the prepared baking sheets. Spray the back of a spoon with cooking spray, and use it to flatten the scoops; respray as needed. Let cool to room temperature.
