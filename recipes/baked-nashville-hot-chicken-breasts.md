## Ingredients

- 1 quart water
- ¼ cup salt
- ¼ cup white sugar
- ¼ cup hot sauce
- 4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into strips
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- ½ teaspoon paprika
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon garlic powder
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper
- ½ teaspoon paprika
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon white sugar
- ¼ teaspoon garlic powder
- cooking spray

## Instructions

1. Mix water, 1/4 cup salt, 1/4 cup sugar, and hot sauce together in a large bowl until sugar and salt are dissolved into the brine. Place chicken pieces in the brine and refrigerate, 30 minutes to 1 hour. Pour brine from the bowl.
2. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place a baking rack onto a baking sheet and coat rack with cooking spray.
3. Combine flour, 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper, 1/2 teaspoon paprika, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder, and black pepper in a shallow bowl until coating is well mixed. Press chicken pieces into the coating until both sides are evenly coated; place on the prepared rack.
4. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Spray each chicken piece with cooking spray; flip and spray the other side. Continue baking until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
5. Heat oil in a small pan over medium heat until shimmering. Mix 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper, 1/2 teaspoon paprika, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon sugar, and 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder together in a bowl; add to oil and cook for 30 seconds. Brush oil mixture onto cooked chicken, adding more layers for extra heat.
