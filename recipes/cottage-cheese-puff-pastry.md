## Ingredients

- 4 ¼ cups 2% cottage cheese
- 2 cups butter, softened
- 5 cups all-purpose flour, or as needed
- 1 ½ cups confectioners' sugar  (Optional)
- 3 tablespoons lemon juice  (Optional)
- 1  lemon, zested  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Beat cottage cheese and butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer until well combined with most cottage cheese curds intact, scraping down the sides of the bowl a few times.
2. Stir flour into butter mixture gradually with a wooden spoon just until a soft dough forms that is no longer sticky; turn dough out onto a floured surface.
3. Bring dough together with floured hands; knead 3 to 4 turns.
4. Roll dough gently into a fairly thick square, fold in half, and pat to flatten again; fold dough in half again in the opposite direction.
5. Repeat rolling and folding process 2 more times.
6. Roll dough into an 8-inch square; divide into 4 equal portions.
7. Wrap each portion in plastic wrap; refrigerate for 4 hours or up to overnight.
8. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
9. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
10. Roll one portion of dough out on a lightly floured surface 1/4-inch thick.
11. Cut dough into 4-inch squares with a sharp knife; cut each square diagonally to make 2 triangles.
12. Roll each dough triangle from the long edge toward the triangle point to form crescent shapes; place on prepared baking sheet.
13. Bake in the preheated oven until golden, about 20 minutes.
14. Remove to cool on a wire rack.
15. Whisk confectioners' sugar, lemon juice, and lemon zest together in a bowl until smooth; brush or drizzle lemon glaze over tops of cooled crescents.
