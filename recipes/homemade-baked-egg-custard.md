## Ingredients

- 1 cup unsalted butter
- ¾ cup white sugar
- 1 large egg
- 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 4  eggs
- ½ cup white sugar
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 2 cups milk
- 1 pinch ground nutmeg, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease the bottom of a deep-dish pie plate.
2. Make pastry: Beat butter, sugar, and egg in a bowl until creamy. Blend in flour to form a dough, using your hands to knead it together at the end.
3. Roll pastry out on a lightly floured surface and place into the prepared pie plate so it covers the bottom and the sides.
4. Make egg custard filling: Beat eggs and sugar in a bowl with an electric mixer until combined. Beat in vanilla extract. Gradually stir in milk until fully incorporated. Pour custard mixture over crust and sprinkle with nutmeg.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until custard is set and a sharp knife inserted near the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes.
6. Remove from the oven and cool completely before serving, about 1 hour.
