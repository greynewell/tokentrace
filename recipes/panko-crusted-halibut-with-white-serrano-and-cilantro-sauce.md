## Ingredients

- 4 (6 ounce) halibut fillets, skin removed
- 1 ½ teaspoons freshly cracked black pepper, divided
- 1 ½ teaspoons sea salt, divided
- ½ cup all-purpose flour
- 2  eggs, lightly beaten
- 1 cup panko bread crumbs
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- ¼ cup minced shallot
- 1 teaspoon minced serrano pepper
- 1 cup half-and-half
- 1 cup roughly chopped cilantro leaves
- 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
- ½ teaspoon sea salt
- ¼ cup canola oil

## Instructions

1. Season halibut fillets all over with 1 teaspoon cracked black pepper and 1 teaspoon sea salt.
2. Whisk flour, remaining black pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon sea salt together in a shallow bowl.
3. Whisk eggs in another shallow bowl.
4. Pour panko bread crumbs into another shallow bowl.
5. Gently roll 1 halibut fillet in flour mixture to coat and shake off any excess.
6. Dip 1 side of fillet into egg, then press egg-coated side into bread crumbs to coat evenly.
7. Place fillet, panko-side up, onto a plate and repeat with remaining fillets.
8. Cover the plate loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate until cold, about 15 minutes.
9. Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium-high heat.
10. Saute shallot and serrano pepper in hot butter until fragrant, about 1 minute.
11. Stir half-and-half and cilantro leaves into shallot mixture, bring to a simmer, and cook, stirring frequently, until reduced by half, 6 to 8 minutes.
12. Remove from heat; stir in lime juice and remaining 1/2 teaspoon sea salt.
13. Puree sauce using an immersion blender until smooth.
14. Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
15. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and place an ovenproof wire rack on the baking sheet.
16. Heat canola oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.
17. Place fillets, panko-side down, in hot oil and cook until golden, about 2 minutes.
18. Flip fillets and transfer, panko-side up, to the wire rack on the prepared baking sheet.
19. Bake fillets in the preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, 6 to 7 minutes.
20. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
21. Transfer fillets to plates and top with cilantro sauce.
