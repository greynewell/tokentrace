## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups whole wheat flour
- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 5 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice
- 2 teaspoons baking soda
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt
- 1 (30 ounce) can pumpkin pie filling (such as Libby's®)
- 3 cups white sugar, or more to taste
- ½ cup vegetable oil
- ½ cup water
- 4 large eggs

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 330 degrees F (166 degrees C). Grease 24 muffin cups or line with paper liners.
2. Mix whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Whisk pumpkin pie filling, sugar, oil, water, and eggs together in a separate bowl until just mixed. Stir flour mixture, about 1/4 cup at a time, into pumpkin mixture until batter is just combined.
