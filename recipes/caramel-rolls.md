## Ingredients

- ¾ cup water
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 cups white bread flour
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 1 ½ tablespoons nonfat dry milk powder
- 1 teaspoon fast-rising dry yeast
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ cup brown sugar
- ¼ cup light corn syrup
- ¼ cup butter
- ¼ cup chopped pecans  (Optional)
- ¼ cup butter, softened
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon

## Instructions

1. Combine water, 2 tablespoons butter, bread flour, white sugar, milk powder, and yeast, in that order, in the bucket of a bread machine. Select the Dough cycle. Remove dough from the machine after the cycle is done, about 1 hour 45 minutes.
2. Combine brown sugar, light corn syrup, and 1/4 cup butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir until sugar is dissolved, about 3 minutes. Pour sauce into an 8-inch square baking pan. Sprinkle with pecans.
3. Turn dough out onto a floured surface, punch it down, and roll into an 8x12-inch rectangle. Dot with 1/4 cup butter and sprinkle with cinnamon. Roll up and pinch seams together. Slice roll into 1 1/2-inch thick slices; place slices into the pan on top of the sauce. Set aside until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
4. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
5. Bake rolls in the preheated oven until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool in the pan for no more than 3 minutes; place a sheet of waxed paper on top of the pan and invert so that sauce and pecans are on top.
