## Ingredients

- 3  lemons, divided
- 3 pounds ripe quinces
- ½  cinnamon stick
- ½ cup white sugar
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, chilled and cubed
- ¾ cup all-purpose flour
- ½ cup brown sugar
- ⅔ cup rolled oats
- 1 pinch salt
- 2 pinches ground nutmeg

## Instructions

1. Wash lemons under cold water and dry well. Thinly peel 2 lemons and juice them. Fill a pot with cold water and add lemon juice and lemon peel.
2. Peel quinces and remove core. Cut into small pieces and immediately drop into the pot with lemon water so they don't turn brown. Add cinnamon stick and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer, cover, and cook until quinces are easily pierced with a knife, 30 to 40 minutes. Drain and remove and discard lemon peel and cinnamon stick.
3. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
4. Zest and juice remaining lemon. Mix cooked quinces, lemon juice, lemon zest, white sugar, and ground cinnamon in a bowl. Pour into a baking dish and level out.
5. Combine butter, flour, brown sugar, oats, and salt in a bowl. Rub between your fingers to create streusel topping. Sprinkle streusel evenly over fruit.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until crumble is lightly browned, about 1 hour.
