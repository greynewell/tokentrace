## Ingredients

- 2 cups water
- ½ cup uncooked short-grain white rice
- 2 cups whole milk
- 4 tablespoons white sugar
- ½ cup whole milk
- 4 tablespoons cornstarch
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon, or more to taste

## Instructions

2. Pour 2 cups milk and sugar into the saucepan and increase heat to high.
3. Meanwhile, stir together 1/2 cup milk and cornstarch in a bowl.
4. Once rice-milk mixture is boiling, add cornstarch mixture and vanilla extract. Stir until well combined. Remove from heat.
