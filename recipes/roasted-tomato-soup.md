## Ingredients

- 3 pounds roma (plum) tomatoes, quartered
- 1  yellow onion, halved and quartered
- ½  red bell pepper, chopped
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 tablespoon sea salt
- 1 ½ teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
- 3 cloves garlic, halved
- 5 cups low-sodium chicken broth
- 2 teaspoons dried basil
