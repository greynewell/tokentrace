## Ingredients

- 4 (5 ounce) cod fillets
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 3 tablespoons butter, melted
- 2 tablespoons sesame seeds
- vegetable oil
- 2 (6 ounce) packages sugar snap peas
- 3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced

## Instructions

1. Brush the air fryer basket with vegetable oil and preheat to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Thaw fish if frozen; blot dry with paper towels, and sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper.
