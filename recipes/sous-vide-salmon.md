## Ingredients

- 1 (8 ounce) salmon fillet
- 1  shallot, finely chopped
- 1 pinch salt and pepper
- 1 teaspoon olive oil

## Instructions

1. Fill a large pot with warm water. Attach a sous vide precision cooker to the pot and set temperature to 125 degrees F (51 degrees C).
2. Place shallot into a plastic bag and lay salmon on top, skin-side down. Use a vacuum sealer to remove air and seal the bag, or use the water-immersion method. Once water temperature has reached 125 degrees F (51°C), add the bag to the pot; set the timer for 45 minutes.
3. Remove the bag from the pot when the timer goes off. Remove salmon and pat dry. Remove and discard shallot.
4. Heat olive oil in a nonstick or cast iron skillet over medium heat until it shimmers. Add salmon, skin-side down, and sear for 1 1/2 minutes. Flip and sear for an additional 1 1/2 minutes.
