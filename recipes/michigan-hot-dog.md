## Ingredients

- 1 pound ground beef
- ⅔ cup finely chopped onion, divided
- 1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
- ⅓ cup ketchup
- 2 tablespoons chili powder
- 1 tablespoon cider vinegar
- 1 tablespoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon hot sauce (such as Frank's® RedHot®)
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon water, or as needed
- 10  hot dog buns
- 10  all beef hot dogs
- 5 teaspoons prepared yellow mustard

## Instructions

1. Brown ground beef and 1/3 cup onion in a large skillet over medium heat, until the meat is no longer pink, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain, and return the skillet to the stove.
2. Stir tomato sauce and ketchup into the ground beef mixture. Add chili powder, vinegar, garlic powder, hot sauce, salt, and pepper; stir until well combined. Reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered until sauce has thickened, 8 to 10 minutes. If sauce gets too thick, add water to thin it out.
3. Meanwhile steam or simmer hot dogs in hot water until hot.
4. Assemble hot dogs: Place a hot dog in a bun and spoon 2 to 3 tablespoons sauce on top. Sprinkle with remaining onions and drizzle with yellow mustard.
