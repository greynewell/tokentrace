## Ingredients

- 1 ½ tablespoons olive oil, divided
- 1 cup pearl (Israeli) couscous
- 1 ½ cups boiling water
- 1  shallot, sliced
- 1 bunch asparagus, cut into 1-inch pieces
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 1  lemon, zested and juiced

## Instructions

1. Heat 1/2 tablespoon olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat; add Israeli couscous. Toast couscous until lightly browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Slowly pour in boiling water. Cover and reduce heat to medium-low; simmer until couscous is tender and water has been absorbed, about 10 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, heat remaining olive oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add shallot and cook until starting to soften, about 1 minute. Increase heat to medium-high. Add asparagus and a pinch of salt; saute until asparagus is tender, 5 to 10 minutes.
3. Stir lemon zest into the asparagus in the last few minutes of cooking. Add cooked couscous and toss with the asparagus mixture. Stir in lemon juice. Taste for seasoning and add salt and pepper if needed.
