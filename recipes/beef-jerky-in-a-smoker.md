## Ingredients

- 4 tablespoons ground black pepper
- 1 cup soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon cider vinegar
- 1 dash hot pepper sauce
- 1 dash Worcestershire sauce

## Instructions

1. In a large, nonporous bowl, combine the ground black pepper, soy sauce, vinegar, hot pepper sauce and Worcestershire sauce. Mix well and add the meat slices. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
