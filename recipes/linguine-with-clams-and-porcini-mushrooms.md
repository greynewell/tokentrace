## Ingredients

- 1 ounce dried porcini mushrooms
- ¼ cup olive oil
- 10 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon dried red pepper flakes
- 36  fresh clams, cleaned
- 2 cups dry white wine
- 4  tomatoes, cubed
- 3 (8 ounce) jars clam juice
- 1 ½ cups chopped fresh parsley
- 1 (16 ounce) package linguine pasta

## Instructions

1. Soak mushrooms 20 to 30 minutes in cold water to rehydrate. Dry, and coarsely chop.
2. Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir in mushrooms, garlic, and red pepper. Cook until browned. Stir in clams and white wine. As clams open, remove to a medium bowl, discarding those that remain closed.
3. Mix tomatoes, clam juice, and parsley into the mushroom mixture. Simmer until slightly thickened, about 15 minutes.
4. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add linguine, and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
5. Return clams to the broth mixture and cook until heated through. Thoroughly mix in cooked linguine just before serving.
