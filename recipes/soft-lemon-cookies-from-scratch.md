## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 1 cup white sugar
- ½ cup butter, softened
- ¼ cup freshly squeezed lemon juice
- 3 tablespoons freshly grated lemon zest, preferably organic
- 1  egg
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- ¼ teaspoon baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon baking soda
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- ½ cup powdered sugar  (Optional)
- 2 tablespoons powdered sugar for sprinkling  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet with cooking spray.
2. Cream sugar and butter in a bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy. Add lemon juice, lemon zest, egg, and vanilla extract; mix on low speed to combine, scraping down the sides of the bowl to incorporate everything evenly.
3. Combine 1 1/2 cups flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a small bowl. Add to the sugar mixture slowly, mixing on low speed until just incorporated. Mix in the remaining 2 tablespoons flour.
4. Place 1/2 cup powdered sugar in a small bowl. Scoop out teaspoonfuls of cookie dough, roll in powdered sugar, and place on the prepared baking sheet, 1 to 2 inches apart.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are light brown on the edges, 9 to 11 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool for 3 minutes on the cookie sheet. Transfer to a cooling rack and sprinkle with additional powdered sugar.
