## Ingredients

- 2 cups vegetable oil for frying
- ¼ cup red cooking wine
- 2 teaspoons water
- ½ cup all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley
- ¾ teaspoon minced garlic
- ½ teaspoon kosher salt
- ground black pepper to taste
- 10  button mushrooms
- 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Whisk the wine, water, flour, parsley, garlic, salt, and pepper together in a bowl until well combined and no lumps are visible. Dip each mushroom individually into the mixture to coat.
