## Ingredients

- 3 cups bread flour
- 3 tablespoons white sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ¼ cup dry milk powder
- 1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
- 2 tablespoons butter, softened
- 1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
- 1  egg white
- 2 tablespoons water

## Instructions

1. Place the bread flour, sugar, salt, milk powder, water, butter, and yeast in the pan of the bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Set on Dough cycle; press Start.
2. Remove risen dough from the machine, deflate, and turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough into twelve equal pieces, and form into rounds. Place the rounds on lightly greased baking sheets. Cover the rolls with a damp cloth, and let rise until doubled in volume, about 40 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
3. In a small bowl, mix together the egg white and 2 tablespoons water; brush lightly onto the rolls. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes, or until the rolls are golden brown.
