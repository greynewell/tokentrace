## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons butter

- 2 tablespoons chopped onion
- ⅓ cup uncooked wild rice
- 1 cup water
- 1 cube chicken bouillon
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 2  Cornish game hens
- salt to taste
- ¼ cup melted butter

## Instructions

1. Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the almonds, onion, and uncooked wild rice. Saute 5 to 10 minutes.
