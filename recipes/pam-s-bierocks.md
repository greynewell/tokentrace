## Ingredients

- 2 cups warm water
- 2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
- ½ cup white sugar
- ¼ cup margarine, softened
- 1  egg
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 7 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 pound lean ground beef
- 1 cup chopped onion
- 6 cups shredded cabbage
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon black pepper
- ¼ cup melted butter

## Instructions

1. Grease a medium bowl and baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray. Set aside.
2. Prepare dough: Stir together warm water and yeast in a large bowl. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.
3. Add 1/2 of the flour, sugar, margarine, egg, and salt to yeast mixture. Beat until smooth; add remaining flour and mix by hand until dough pulls together. Place into the prepared medium bowl; cover with foil. Refrigerate for 2 hours to overnight, or let rise at room temperature for 1 hour.
4. While dough rises, make filling: Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in cabbage, onion, salt, and pepper; cook, stirring occasionally, over medium-low heat until cabbage is tender, about 30 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat and let cool until lukewarm.
5. Punch down dough and divide into 20 equal pieces. Flatten and spread each piece of dough out on an unfloured surface; fill with about 2 tablespoons filling. Fold dough over and seal edges. Place onto the prepared baking sheet and let rise for 1 hour.
6. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
7. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 25 minutes. Brush tops with melted butter and serve warm.
