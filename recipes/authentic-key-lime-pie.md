## Ingredients

- 2 (14 ounce) cans sweetened condensed milk
- 4 jumbo egg yolks
- ½ cup Key lime juice
- 1 (8 inch) graham cracker crust

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Whisk condensed milk and egg yolks together in a large mixing bowl. Mix in Key lime juice; mixture will be thin at first but will thicken as it is whisked. Whisk until smooth and thick. Pour into the graham cracker crust.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until filling is firm to the touch and only slightly jiggly in the center, 12 to 15 minutes.
4. Cool to room temperature, then refrigerate before serving, 5 hours to overnight.
