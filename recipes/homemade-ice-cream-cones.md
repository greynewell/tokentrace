## Ingredients

- 2  eggs
- ½ cup white sugar
- ¼ cup butter, melted and cooled
- 3 tablespoons milk
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- ⅓ cup all-purpose flour
- ⅛ teaspoon salt
- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Whisk together eggs and sugar in a large bowl until frothy. Whisk in butter, milk, and vanilla. Gradually whisk in flour and salt until smooth. The batter should be thin; you can stir in more milk if needed.
2. Heat a small skillet or griddle over medium heat. Brush the pan lightly with oil. Pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet and turn to spread out the batter into a thin circle. When the underside is golden brown, flip over and cook until golden on the other side. Remove from the pan and form into a cone while it's hot, squeezing the end to seal.
3. Place on a wire rack to cool and harden completely. Repeat with the remaining batter.
