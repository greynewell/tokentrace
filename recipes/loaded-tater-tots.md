## Ingredients

- 1 (32 ounce) package frozen bite-size potato nuggets (such as Tater Tots®)
- 4 slices bacon
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1  shallot, minced
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ cups whole milk
- 2 tablespoons sour cream  (Optional)
- 1 pinch ground black pepper
- 1 pinch nutmeg
- 1 ½ cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese, divided
- 3  green onions, sliced
- 2 tablespoons sour cream, or to taste  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Arrange potato nuggets in a single layer on a baking sheet.
2. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden, 20 to 25 minutes.
3. Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels and chop coarsely.
4. Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat; add shallot and cook until fragrant. Stir in flour and cook until light golden, about 2 minutes. Whisk in milk and 2 tablespoons sour cream; stir until smooth and thick, about 5 minutes. Season with black pepper and nutmeg. Stir in 1 cup Cheddar cheese until fully melted.
5. Transfer potatoes to a 9x13-inch baking dish. Sprinkle bacon on top. Pour cheese sauce over the potatoes. Sprinkle remaining 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese on top.
6. Bake in the preheated oven just until cheese melts, about 7 minutes. Remove from the oven; top with green onions and 2 tablespoons sour cream.
