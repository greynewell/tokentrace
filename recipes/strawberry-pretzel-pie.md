## Ingredients

- 2 cups coarsely crushed pretzels
- ¾ cup margarine, melted
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 (8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed
- 2 (3 ounce) packages strawberry flavored Jell-O®
- 2 cups boiling water
- 2 (10 ounce) packages frozen sweetened strawberries (do not thaw)

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
