## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 1  white onion, chopped
- ½ cup dry white wine
- ½ cup cooking sherry
- 5 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- ½ (6 ounce) can tomato paste
- 1 ½ cups chicken broth
- 5 cups milk
- ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste
- ⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ teaspoon seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®)
- 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
- 1  green onion, finely chopped
- 1 ½ cups cooked lobster claw, cut into bite-sized pieces

## Instructions

1. Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the chopped onion, and cook until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the white wine and sherry. Cook and stir until the liquid has reduced by half. Sprinkle in the flour while stirring to ensure there are no lumps. Once a thick paste has formed, stir in the tomato paste, then pour in the chicken broth and milk. Season with cayenne pepper, black pepper, seafood seasoning, Worcestershire sauce, and green onion.
2. Cook and stir over medium heat until the bisque begins to simmer, about 15 minutes. Stir in the lobster meat, and reheat before serving.
