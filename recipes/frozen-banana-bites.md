## Ingredients

- 1 cup peanut butter
- 4  bananas, sliced into 1-inch rounds
- 8 (1 ounce) squares semisweet chocolate
- 1 tablespoon shortening
- ⅓ cup toffee baking bits

## Instructions

1. Cover a baking sheet with waxed paper.
2. Spoon a thin layer of peanut butter on top of each banana slice. Insert a toothpick through the peanut butter layer into the banana. Place banana bites onto the prepared baking sheet; freeze for 30 minutes to overnight.
3. Melt chocolate and shortening in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching.
