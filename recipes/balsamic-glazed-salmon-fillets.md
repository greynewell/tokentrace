## Ingredients

- 6 (5 ounce) salmon fillets
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon white wine
- 1 tablespoon honey
- ⅓ cup balsamic vinegar
- 4 teaspoons Dijon mustard
- salt and pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil, then spray with nonstick cooking spray.
2. Coat a small saucepan with nonstick cooking spray; place over medium heat. Cook and stir garlic in the hot pan until soft, about 3 minutes. Stir in balsamic vinegar, mustard, honey, white wine, salt, and pepper. Simmer, uncovered, until slightly thickened, about 3 minutes.
3. Arrange salmon fillets on the prepared baking sheet. Brush fillets with balsamic glaze; sprinkle with oregano.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until flesh flakes easily with a fork, 10 to 14 minutes. Brush fillets with remaining glaze; season with salt and pepper. Use a spatula to transfer fillets to a serving platter, leaving the skin behind on the foil.
