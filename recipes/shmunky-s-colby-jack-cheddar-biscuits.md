## Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon olive oil
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1 ½ teaspoons dried parsley
- ⅛ teaspoon ground thyme
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- 1 cup shredded Colby-Monterey Jack cheese
- ¼ cup shredded white Cheddar cheese
- 6 tablespoons butter
- 1 cup 2% milk

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Using olive oil, grease a baking sheet.
2. With a fork, mix together the flour, baking powder, parsley, thyme, salt, sugar, Colby-Monterey Jack cheese, and white Cheddar cheese together in a bowl. Cut the butter into the flour mixture in coarse chunks, then use the fork to further cut the butter into the flour-cheese mixture until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Lightly stir in the milk just until the dough holds together.
3. Drop the batter by heaping 1/8-cup measuring cup onto the prepared baking sheet, and bake in the preheated oven until risen and golden brown, 20 to 30 minutes.
