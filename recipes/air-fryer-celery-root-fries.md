## Ingredients

- ½  celeriac (celery root), peeled and cut into 1/2-inch sticks
- 3 cups water
- 1 tablespoon lime juice
- ⅓ cup vegan mayonnaise
- 1 tablespoon brown mustard
- 1 teaspoon powdered horseradish
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Put celery root in a bowl. Pour in water and lime juice. Mix and let sit for 20 minutes.
2. Preheat the air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
3. Make the mayo sauce. Mix together vegan mayonnaise, mustard, and horseradish powder. Keep covered in the refrigerator until needed.
