## Ingredients

- vegetable oil for frying
- 2 pounds chicken wing pieces
- ¼ cup margarine, melted
- ¼ cup hot sauce (such as Frank's RedHot ®)
- 6 cloves garlic, chopped
- 1 (1 ounce) envelope dry onion soup mix
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 1 pinch dried basil

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Fry chicken in the hot oil, working in batches, until no longer pink in the center and is crispy on the outside, 10 to 15 minutes per batch. Transfer chicken to a paper towel-lined plate using a slotted spoon; set aside until cool enough to touch.
3. Stir margarine, hot sauce, garlic, onion soup mix, lemon juice, and basil together in a bowl until sauce is smooth.
4. Put chicken in a large resealable bag; add the sauce, seal the bag, and shake until wings are coated. Spread wings into a baking sheet.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until sauce has baked onto the chicken, about 5 minutes.
