## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, chopped
- 2 slices bacon, chopped
- 4 cups chicken stock
- ½ cup dry white wine
- 4 tablespoons salted butter
- 4 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- ½ cup cream
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add chicken, onion, garlic, and bacon. Cook and stir until chicken is browned on all sides, 5 to 7 minutes.
2. Add stock and white wine. Lower heat and simmer for 15 minutes. Remove chicken to a plate. Strain liquid into a bowl and separate onion and bacon.
