## Ingredients

- 1 (8 ounce) package linguine pasta
- 1 (12 ounce) bag broccoli florets, cut into bite-size pieces
- ¼ cup olive oil
- 4 teaspoons minced garlic
- ½ teaspoon red pepper flakes
- ½ cup finely shredded Romano cheese
- 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- salt to taste

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain and return to pot.
