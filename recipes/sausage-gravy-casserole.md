## Ingredients

- 1 (16 ounce) package Jimmy Dean® Premium Pork Regular Sausage
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon chicken bouillon powder, or more to taste
- ground black pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons quick-mixing all-purpose flour, or more to taste
- 3 cups milk
- 1 teaspoon unsalted butter, or as needed
- 1 (10 count) package refrigerated buttermilk biscuits

## Instructions

1. Add sausage to a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir with a spatula, breaking apart the sausage until cooked, 5 to 7 minutes. Season with onion powder, garlic powder, chicken bouillon, and pepper. Mix until well combined and fully cooked, 5 to 7 minutes.
2. Stir quick-mixing flour into the sausage. Pour in milk and stir until well combined.
3. Bring gravy to a boil. Reduce heat and stir until the gravy thickens, 5 to 7 minutes. Taste for seasoning and adjust according to taste. Set aside while preparing the biscuits.
4. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking dish with butter and set aside.
5. Cut each individual biscuit into 4 pieces. Arrange 1/2 of the biscuit pieces in the bottom of the baking dish. Completely cover biscuits with gravy. Place remaining biscuit pieces on top.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until the biscuits are fully cooked and golden brown, 13 to 15 minutes.
7. Remove from the oven and let stand for 3 to 5 minutes before serving.
