## Ingredients

- 1 cup orange juice
- ⅓ cup soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary
- 3 teaspoons minced garlic
- 2 (3/4 pound) whole pork tenderloins
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Make the orange marinade by whisking together the orange juice, soy sauce, rosemary, and garlic. Pour over pork tenderloin and marinate for at least one hour, preferably overnight.
