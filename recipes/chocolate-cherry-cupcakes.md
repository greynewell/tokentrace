## Ingredients

- 2 ½ cups frozen tart cherries, pitted
- ½ cup white sugar
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 2 teaspoons baking soda
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar
- ½ cup unsalted butter, softened
- ½ cup white sugar
- 2 large eggs, at room temperature
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 cup sour cream, at room temperature
- ½ cup strongly brewed coffee, cooled to room temperature
- 1 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 4 cups powdered sugar, or as needed
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons heavy cream

## Instructions

1. Bring cherries, sugar, and lemon juice to a simmer in a medium pot over medium-low heat. Cook until sugar is dissolved, stirring frequently. Remove 2 tablespoons of cherry juice from the pot and place in a small bowl. Stir in cornstarch until thoroughly combined. Add cornstarch mixture to the pot and simmer until thickened and slightly reduced, about 5 minutes more.
2. Remove compote from heat and cool completely. Measure out 1 cup for the cupcake batter. Reserve remaining compote, about 6 tablespoons, for the frosting.
3. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line or grease two standard 12-cup muffin tins.
4. Whisk flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl. Set aside.
5. Beat brown sugar, butter, and white sugar together in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in vanilla extract. Mix in 1/3 of the flour mixture, stirring until just combined. Pour in 1/2 of the sour cream and cooled coffee; mix until just combined.
6. Continue alternating additions of the flour mixture with sour cream and coffee, beginning and ending with the flour mixture, until batter is smooth. Do not overmix. Gently fold in 1 cup cherry compote. Fill each prepared muffin cup 2/3 full of batter.
7. Bake in the preheated oven until the tops of the cupcakes spring back lightly when touched, 15 to 18 minutes. Cool in the tins for a few minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
8. Prepare cherry buttercream while the cupcakes are cooling. Beat butter in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Add powdered sugar, 1 cup at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix in vanilla and salt. Add 2 tablespoons of cherry compote and beat on medium-high speed until thoroughly combined. Repeat twice more with remaining cherry compote, beating well after each addition. Add heavy cream and beat until frosting is fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes.
9. Spread or pipe frosting over the cooled cupcakes.
