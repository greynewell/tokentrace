## Ingredients

- 2 pounds quinces - peeled, cored, and diced
- 2 cups hard apple cider
- ½ cup sugar, or more to taste
- ½  lemon, juiced
- ½ teaspoon orange flower water
- ½ teaspoon grated orange zest
- ½ cup heavy cream
- 2 teaspoons vanilla sugar
- 3 tablespoons creme fraiche

## Instructions

1. Place quinces, cider, and sugar in a pressure cooker. Close cooker securely and place pressure regulator over vent according to manufacturer's instructions. Heat until steam escapes in a steady flow and makes a whistling sound, about 10 minutes. Adjust temperature until regulator is gently rocking. Cook for 15 to 20 minutes until quince are soft. Let pressure release naturally according to manufacturer's instructions, 5 to 10 minutes. Unlock lid and remove.
2. Transfer cooked quinces and liquid to a serving bowl and season with lemon juice, orange flower water, and orange zest.
3. Beat cream in a chilled glass or metal bowl using an electric mixer until frothy. Add vanilla sugar gradually, continuing to beat until soft peaks form. Mix in creme fraiche and serve with the quince compote.
