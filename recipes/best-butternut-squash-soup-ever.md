## Ingredients

- 1 ½ tablespoons butter
- ½  onion, sliced
- 2 cloves garlic
- 2 sprigs fresh thyme
- ½  butternut squash - peeled, seeded, and cut into 1-inch cubes
- 4 cups chicken stock
- ½ cube chicken bouillon
- 1 pinch ground cumin
- 1 pinch ground allspice
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat; cook the onion, garlic, and thyme in the hot butter until the onion has softened, about 5 minutes. Add the squash and chicken stock; bring to a simmer and cook until the squash is tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Crumble the bouillon into the soup; season with cumin, allspice, salt, and pepper; remove from heat.
2. Pour the soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway. Hold the lid of the blender in place with a kitchen towel and carefully start the blender using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until smooth and pour into a serving bowl. Alternately, you can use a stick blender and puree the soup in the pot.
