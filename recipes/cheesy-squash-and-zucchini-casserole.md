## Ingredients

- 1 pound yellow squash, sliced
- 1 pound zucchini, sliced
- ½  onion, diced
- 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
- ½ cup biscuit baking mix (such as Bisquick®)
- ½ cup butter
- 2  eggs
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 10  saltine crackers, or as needed, crushed
- ¼ cup bread crumbs

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
2. Fill a large pot with water and bring to a rolling boil. Add yellow squash, zucchini, and onion; bring back to a boil, and cook vegetables until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain and transfer vegetables to a large bowl.
3. Mix Cheddar cheese, baking mix, butter, eggs, sugar, and salt with the cooked vegetables using a large spoon; stir until butter has melted and baking mix has dissolved.
