- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- 2 teaspoons olive oil
- 1 large onion, sliced
- 1 large green pepper, sliced

## Instructions

1. Place beef in the slow cooker crock. Pour beef stock, vinegar, and Worcestershire over beef. Cook on Low until beef is cooked to medium, 3-4 hours. Remove cooked beef from broth and set aside. Reserve broth.
