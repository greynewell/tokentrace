## Ingredients

- 1 (10 pound) bone-in spiral-cut ham
- 1 cup orange marmalade
- 1 teaspoon McCormick® Mustard, Ground
- ½ teaspoon McCormick® Garlic Powder
- ¼ teaspoon McCormick® Black Pepper, Ground
- ¼ teaspoon McCormick® Cloves, Ground

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Place ham on its side in a roasting pan. Mix marmalade and spices in a small bowl until well blended. Brush 1/2 of the marmalade mixture over ham, gently separating slices so mixture can reach middle of ham. Cover loosely with foil.
2. Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour, basting occasionally with pan drippings. Remove foil. Brush with remaining marmalade mixture. Bake 45 minutes longer. Serve ham with pan drippings.
