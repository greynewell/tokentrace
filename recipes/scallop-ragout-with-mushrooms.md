## Ingredients

- ¼ cup canola oil, divided
- 6  large chanterelle mushrooms, quartered
- 2 strips applewood-smoked bacon, chopped
- ½ cup peeled and chopped celery root
- 1 medium shallot, finely chopped
- 1 cup vegetable broth
- 1 cup whipping cream
- ½ cup dry white wine
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- coarse salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 pound large sea scallops

## Instructions

1. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned, 5 to 7 minutes.
2. Add bacon, celery root, and shallot to the skillet; cook until shallot is tender, about 5 minutes. Add broth, cream, and wine and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, until liquid is reduced by half, 8 to 10 minutes.
3. Whisk butter into the skillet until melted. Stir in parsley and lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer mixture to a bowl and keep warm.
4. Sprinkle scallops lightly with salt and pepper. Wipe out the cast iron skillet and place over medium-high heat. Add remaining oil. Add scallops to hot oil and cook until slightly browned, firm, and opaque, about 2 minutes per side. Serve scallops and ragout together.
