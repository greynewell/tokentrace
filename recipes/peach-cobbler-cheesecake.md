## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 1 ½ cups graham cracker crumbs
- 5 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- ¼ teaspoon kosher salt
- 3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, at room temperature
- 1 cup white sugar
- 3 large eggs
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon kosher salt
- ¼ cup bourbon
- ¼ cup peach preserves
- 2 cups peeled, pitted, and chopped peaches
- ½ cup unsalted butter, softened
- ½ cup white sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ¼ teaspoon kosher salt

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a 9-inch springform pan with cooking spray.
2. Stir together graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, sugar, and salt for crust in a medium bowl until evenly combined. Press crumb mixture along the bottom and up the sides of the prepared pan.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until set and golden, about 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack for 30 minutes. Leave the oven on.
4. Prepare the cheesecake while crust cools: Beat together cream cheese and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating on low until just combined after each addition. Beat in flour and salt on low until just combined. Beat in bourbon and preserves on low until just combined. Fold in chopped peaches until just combined. Pour filling into the cooled crust.
5. Gently jiggle pan to smooth top. Place cheesecake in a plastic slow cooker liner; transfer to a large roasting pan. (Or double wrap the springform pan with heavy-duty aluminum foil.) Place roasting pan in the oven. Pour warm water into the roasting pan to come halfway up sides of pan, making sure you do not get any water into the slow cooker liner.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until cheesecake is just set on top, about 35 minutes.
7. While cheesecake bakes, prepare the topping: Beat butter and sugar in a medium bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Add egg, beating on low until just combined. Whisk together flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt in a small bowl; add to butter mixture with mixer on low, beating until just combined.
8. Open the oven door and carefully slide out rack with cheesecake without removing from oven. Carefully dollop topping mixture by spoonfuls over cheesecake. Carefully slide rack back in and close oven.
9. Continue baking until topping is golden on top and cheesecake is almost set in center, about 1 hour. Turn oven off and prop oven door ajar about 1 inch. Let cheesecake stand in oven for 1 hour.
10. Remove cheesecake from oven and remove from roasting pan. Let cool at room temperature for 1 hour. Remove cheesecake from the liner and transfer to the refrigerator. Chill, uncovered, at least 6 hours or up to 12 hours. Remove metal collar from cheesecake before slicing and serving.
