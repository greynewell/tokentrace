## Ingredients

- 7  egg yolks
- ½ cup Marsala wine
- ⅓ cup white sugar
- 1 cup heavy cream, whipped to stiff peaks

## Instructions

1. Fill a large saucepan with several inches of water, and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat until the water maintains a strong simmer. Place the egg yolks, Marsala wine, and sugar into a metal mixing bowl. Place the bowl over the simmering water. Beat constantly with a wire whisk until the zabaglione turns pale yellow and thickens to the consistency of softly whipped cream.
2. Scrape the zabaglione into a clean mixing bowl and set over ice, stirring occasionally until cold. Once cold, fold in the whipped cream.
