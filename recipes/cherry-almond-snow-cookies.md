## Ingredients

- 1 cup softened butter
- 2 cups powdered sugar, divided, or more as needed
- ½ cup white sugar
- ¼ cup finely chopped maraschino cherries
- 3 tablespoons amaretto liqueur
- 2 tablespoons tart cherry juice concentrate
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon almond extract
- 1 cup ground almonds
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- ¼ teaspoon salt

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
2. Combine butter, 1 cup powdered sugar, and white sugar in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until creamy. Mix in cherries, amaretto liqueur, cherry juice concentrate, vanilla extract, and almond extract. Beat in ground almonds.
3. Combine flour and salt in a separate bowl; add to butter mixture and blend until well combined. Roll dough into 1 1/2-inch balls and place on the prepared baking sheets with room in between, as cookies will expand with baking.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden, about 20 minutes. Cool on the baking sheets for 10 minutes.
5. While cookies are cooling, place remaining 1 cup powdered sugar in a bowl. Coat each cookie in powdered sugar until completely covered. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
