## Ingredients

- 1 cup chopped walnuts
- 1 (18.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix
- 1 (3.4 ounce) package instant vanilla pudding mix
- 4  eggs
- ½ cup water
- ½ cup vegetable oil
- ½ cup dark rum
- ½ cup butter
- ¼ cup water
- 1 cup white sugar
- ½ cup dark rum

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10-inch Bundt pan. Sprinkle chopped walnuts evenly over the bottom of the pan.
2. Combine cake mix and pudding mix in a large bowl. Mix in eggs, 1/2 cup rum, 1/2 cup water, and oil until well-blended. Pour batter over chopped nuts in the pan.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into cake comes out clean, about 1 hour.
4. Meanwhile, combine sugar, butter, and remaining 1/4 cup water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat; cook, stirring constantly, until it thickens and slightly darkens, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in remaining 1/2 cup rum.
5. Let baked cake sit in the pan for 10 minutes, then invert onto a serving plate. Brush glaze over top and sides. Allow cake to absorb glaze and repeat until all glaze is used.
