## Ingredients

- 4 large Golden Delicious apples
- ¼ cup water
- 2 tablespoons muscovado (dark brown) sugar
- 2 tablespoons apricot jam
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1 tablespoon water
- 1 teaspoon cornstarch

## Instructions

1. Heat a large skillet over medium-low heat. Peel and core apples. Cut them into quarters, then each quarter into 3 pieces. Add apples to the skillet immediately after they are cut.
2. Add 1/4 cup water, muscovado sugar, jam, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Mix to combine all ingredients and to coat apples evenly. Cover and cook until tender, about 10 minutes. Do not open the lid during this time. Shake the skillet to stir around the apples but do not stir them with utensils.
