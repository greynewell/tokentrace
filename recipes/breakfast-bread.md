## Ingredients

- 2 cups milk
- ½ cup unsalted butter
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
- ⅔ cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
- 1  egg, beaten
- 7 cups all-purpose flour

## Instructions

1. Heat the milk in a small saucepan until it bubbles, then remove from heat.
2. Add the butter, salt and sugar and stir until melted; let cool until lukewarm.
3. In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water.
4. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.
5. In a large bowl, combine milk mixture with the yeast mixture.
6. Mix in the egg and 3 cups of flour.
7. Stir in the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, beating well after each addition.
8. When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.
9. Lightly oil a large bowl, place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil.
10. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
11. Deflate the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface.
12. Divide the dough into two equal pieces and form into loaves.
13. Place the loaves into two lightly greased 9x5 inch loaf pans.
14. Cover the loaves with a damp cloth and let rise until dough reaches the pan tops, about 30 minutes.
15. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
16. Bake in preheated oven for 45 to 50 minutes, or until bottom of the loaves sound hollow when tapped.
17. Place on wire racks to cool.
