## Ingredients

- ½ cup butter
- 1 ½ cups white sugar
- 2  eggs
- 1 cup buttermilk
- 1 fluid ounce red food coloring
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 ½ teaspoons baking soda
- 1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar
- 2 cups all-purpose flour

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 12 cup muffin pans or line with 20 paper baking cups.
2. In a large bowl, beat the butter and sugar with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Mix in the eggs, buttermilk, red food coloring and vanilla. Stir in the baking soda and vinegar.
