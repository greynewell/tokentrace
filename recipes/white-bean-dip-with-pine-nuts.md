## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons pine nuts
- 2 teaspoons chopped fresh basil
- 1 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano
- 1 cup cooked Great Northern beans
- 2 cloves garlic, cut in half
- 1 teaspoon lime juice
- 1  roma (plum) tomato, roughly chopped
- sea salt to taste
- black pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon olive oil

## Instructions

1. Place the pine nuts, basil, and oregano into a food processor. Cover, and pulse 2 or 3 times to finely grind the nuts. Add beans and garlic; process until smooth, about 30 seconds to 1 minute.
