## Ingredients

- ¼ cup butter
- ¾ cup light brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon pineapple juice
- 1 tablespoon dark rum  (Optional)
- ½ small fresh pineapple - peeled, cored, and sliced
- ½ cup butter
- 1 ¼ cups gluten-free all-purpose baking flour
- ¼ cup almond flour
- ½ cup white sugar
- 2 ⅛ teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ⅛ teaspoon ground cardamom
- 2 large eggs
- ½ cup cold milk
- 1 (4 ounce) jar maraschino cherries for garnish

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Melt 1/4 cup butter in a 12-inch cast iron skillet over medium-low heat. Stir in brown sugar, pineapple juice, and rum. Cook until sugar is dissolved and mixture is bubbling, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and place pineapple slices in the skillet in a single layer, covering sugar mixture completely. Set skillet aside.
3. Melt 1/2 cup butter in small skillet over low heat until butter begins to brown and releases a nutty fragrance, about 5 minutes, being careful to not burn the butter. Remove from heat and let cool for 10 minutes.
4. Combine gluten-free flour and almond flour in a bowl. Mix in white sugar, baking powder, salt, and cardamom until well combined. Whisk in eggs and cold milk; mix until just combined. Pour in melted butter from the small skillet and stir until batter is mixed thoroughly. Pour batter over pineapple slices in the 12-inch skillet. Use a spatula to smooth out surface and spread evenly.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until cake begins to bubble around the edges, the top is browned, and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Let cool in the skillet for 10 minutes.
6. Run a knife around the edge of the cake to loosen it from the skillet. Place a large plate on top of the skillet and flip over, presenting the cake with pineapple slices on top. Garnish with maraschino cherries.
