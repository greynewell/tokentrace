## Ingredients

- 2 ⅛ cups all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon cream of tartar
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ cup white sugar
- ½ cup confectioners' sugar
- ½ cup butter
- ½ cup vegetable oil
- 1  egg
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- ⅓ cup white sugar
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- 3 cups fresh strawberries, hulled and halved

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 10-by-15 inch jelly roll pan.
2. For the crust, sift together the flour, cream of tartar, and baking soda into a mixing bowl. In a separate bowl, cream together white and confectioners' sugars, butter, vegetable oil, egg, and vanilla. Add the dry ingredients. Blend well. Spread the dough evenly on the bottom of the greased pan. Bake until golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Allow to cool completely.
3. For the filling, cream together the cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla. Spread over the cooled crust. Arrange the fruit on the cream cheese filling and refrigerate.
4. For the glaze, mix together the sugar and cornstarch in a small saucepan. Whisk in the water, orange juice, and lemon juice. Bring to a boil over medium heat; boil gently for one minute. Remove from heat and allow to cool completely.
5. Spoon or brush the glaze evenly over the fruit. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
