## Ingredients

- 3 strips bacon, divided
- 2 ounces Cheddar cheese, cubed, divided
- ¼ cup barbeque sauce, divided
- 2 (4 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breasts
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat an air fryer to 380 degrees F (190 degrees C). Cook 1 strip of bacon in the air fryer for 2 minutes. Remove from air fryer and cut into small pieces. Line the air fryer basket with parchment paper and increase the temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Combine cooked bacon, Cheddar cheese, and 1 tablespoon barbeque sauce in a bowl.
3. Use a long, sharp knife to make a horizontal 1-inch cut at the top of each chicken breast, creating a small internal pouch. Stuff each breast equally with bacon-cheese mixture. Wrap remaining strips of bacon around each chicken breast. Coat chicken breast with remaining barbecue sauce and place into the prepared air fryer basket.
4. Cook for 10 minutes in the air fryer, turn, and continue cooking until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 10 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
