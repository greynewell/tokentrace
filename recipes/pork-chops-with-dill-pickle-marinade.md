## Ingredients

- 4  center cut pork chops
- 1 cup dill pickle juice
- salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Arrange pork chops in a shallow dish. Cover with pickle juice. Marinate in refrigerator at least one hour, but I recommend from 8 to 24 hours.
2. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil grate.
3. Drain pork chops and discard marinade. Cook the pork chops on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center, 6 to 8 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
