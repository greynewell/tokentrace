## Ingredients

- 2 cups flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 ¼ cups white sugar
- ½ cup shortening
- 2  egg, beaten
- 1 cup mashed ripe banana
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ½ cup buttermilk

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a loaf pan.
2. Sift flour, baking soda, and cinnamon together in a bowl.

Beat sugar and shortening together in a separate large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy; add 1 egg at a time, thoroughly beating the first into the sugar mixture before adding the second.
