## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- ½ cup orange-cranberry muffin mix (such as Krusteaz®)
- ¼ cup packed brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 5 tablespoons butter, chilled and diced
- 1  apple, diced
- ⅓ cup sweetened dried cranberries (such as Craisins®)
- ¾ cup half-and-half
- 1  egg
- 1  egg white
- 1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.
2. Whisk flour, muffin mix, brown sugar, baking powder, nutmeg, and salt together in a bowl. Cut butter into flour mixture using a pastry blender or fork until it resembles coarse crumbs.
3. Combine apple and dried cranberries together in a bowl; mix into flour mixture.
4. Beat half-and-half and egg together in a bowl until frothy; slowly stir into flour mixture using a rubber spatula until dough forms. Knead dough 4 to 5 times. Roll dough into a rectangle onto a lightly floured work surface using your hands. Cut rectangle in half diagonally and each half into 4 triangles, making 8 triangles. Arrange triangles on the prepared baking sheet.
5. Whisk egg white and confectioners' sugar together in a bowl; brush over each triangle.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until scones are golden brown, about 20 minutes.
