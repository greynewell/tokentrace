## Ingredients

- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 cup dark corn syrup
- 1 tablespoon vinegar
- 1 tablespoon baking soda
- 1 pound chocolate confectioners' coating

## Instructions

1. Butter a 9x13 inch baking dish.
2. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine sugar, corn syrup and vinegar. Cook, stirring, until sugar dissolves. Heat, without stirring, to 300 to 310 degrees F (149 to 154 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms hard, brittle threads.
3. Remove from heat and stir in baking soda. Pour into prepared pan; do not spread. (Mixture will not fill pan.) Allow to cool completely.
4. In the microwave or over a double boiler, melt coating chocolate, stirring frequently until smooth. Break cooled candy into bite-sized pieces and dip into melted candy coating. Let set on waxed paper. Store tightly covered.
