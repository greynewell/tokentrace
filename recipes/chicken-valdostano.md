## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 6  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded thin
- ¼ cup unsalted butter
- 10  fresh mushrooms, sliced
- ¾ cup dry white wine
- ¾ cup chicken stock
- 3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground white pepper
- 6 slices thinly sliced prosciutto
- 6 slices fontina cheese

## Instructions

1. Lightly flour chicken breasts, shaking off excess flour. In a large skillet over low heat, melt butter/margarine. Add chicken and saute until lightly browned, about 2 minutes each side. Remove with slotted spatula and set aside.
2. Increase heat to medium low. Add mushrooms and saute until juices are rendered, about 4 minutes. Add wine and simmer until reduced by 1/4, about 3 to 4 minutes. Increase heat to medium high. Add stock, parsley and pepper and simmer until sauce reduced to 1 cup, about 10 minutes.
3. Reduce heat to low. Top each chicken breast with a slice of prosciutto and a slice of fontina cheese. Return chicken to skillet and cook just until cheese melts. Transfer chicken to individual plates and top each with some of the mushroom sauce before serving.
