## Ingredients

- 2 pounds salmon fillets
- 2  lemons
- 1 ½ cups pesto
- ½ cup white wine

## Instructions

1. Lightly oil a baking pan large enough to accommodate the fish. Place salmon in pan skin-side down. Squeeze juice of 1 lemon and white wine over salmon; set aside to marinate for 15 minutes.
2. Set an oven rack about 9 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
3. Spread a 1/4-inch thick layer of pesto on top of salmon.
4. Cook under the preheated broiler until a crust forms and fish flakes easily with a fork, about 8 to 10 minutes.
5. Remove salmon and set aside for a few minutes. Squeeze juice from 1/2 lemon over fish. Slice the remaining 1/2 lemon into thin slices; arrange on salmon.
