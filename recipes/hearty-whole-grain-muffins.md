## Ingredients

- ½ cup raisins
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 cup whole wheat flour
- ⅔ cup white sugar
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 18 muffin cups with paper liners.
2. In a small bowl, cover the raisins with water, and set aside to plump. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, allspice, dry milk powder, wheat bran, and farina cereal until thoroughly combined.
3. Drain water from the raisins. In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until frothy, then mix in the drained raisins, applesauce, carrot, vegetable oil, and bran cereal. Pour the liquid ingredients into the flour mixture, and briefly mix just to moisten (do not overmix). Fill muffin cups about 2/3 full, and sprinkle each muffin with about 1/2 teaspoon of raw sugar.
