## Ingredients

- ½ cup Mexican crema, crema fresca
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- 1 tablespoon chicken bouillon granules
- 5  poblano peppers
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1  onions, thickly sliced
- 1 cup drained canned corn kernels

## Instructions

1. Blend the crema, cream cheese, and chicken bouillon in a blender until smooth; set aside.
2. Place the peppers on a large griddle over medium-high heat. Roast until the skin blisters and turns black. Remove peppers from griddle and place in a plastic bag, allowing them to sweat for 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate to cool. Peel and discard the outer skin of the peppers; halve length-wise and remove the seeds and veins. Slice into thick strips. Set aside.
3. Heat the vegetable oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat; cook the onion in the hot oil until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir the corn into the onions, reduce the heat to medium, and cook another 5 minutes. Add the poblano strips to the saucepan. Pour the cream mixture over the vegetables and bring to a simmer; cook at a simmer until hot, about 5 minutes more.
