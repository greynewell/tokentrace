## Ingredients

- 12  small chicken wings
- ¼ teaspoon seasoned salt, or to taste
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon coarse salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- ¼ teaspoon paprika
- 1 (12 fluid ounce) bottle Buffalo wing sauce (such as Frank's®), or to taste
- 2 quarts vegetable oil for frying

## Instructions

1. Season chicken wings lightly with seasoned salt.
2. Mix flour, salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and paprika together in a wide, shallow bowl. Press wings into flour mixture to coat and arrange in a single layer on a large plate. Refrigerate coated wings for 15 to 30 minutes.
3. Dredge wings again in flour mixture and return to the plate. Refrigerate wings once more for 15 to 30 minutes.
4. Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
5. Fry chicken wings in hot oil until crisp and juices run clear, 10 to 12 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the meat, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
6. Transfer fried wings to a large bowl. Drizzle sauce over wings and toss to coat.
