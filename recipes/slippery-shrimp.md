## Ingredients

- 2 cups peanut oil for frying
- 1 pound peeled and deveined large shrimp
- ¼ cup cornstarch
- 2 large cloves garlic, minced
- ½ teaspoon minced fresh ginger
- ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper

- 1 tablespoon white vinegar

## Instructions

1. Heat peanut oil in a wok to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
