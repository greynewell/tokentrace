## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons butter
- ½ large onion, diced
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
- 6 cups chicken stock, divided
- 2 cups chopped fiddlehead ferns
- 1  carrot, diced
- 1  potato, diced
- 2 cups heavy whipping cream
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce  (Optional)
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce  (Optional)
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Melt butter in a large pot over medium-high heat until foamy, about 1 minute. Stir in onion and garlic; cook and stir until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes.
2. Stir in flour and cook, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes.
3. Pour 4 cups chicken stock into the onion mixture, and bring to a full boil; stir in fiddleheads, carrot, and potato. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes.
4. Blend soup until smooth with a hand-held blender. Stir in cream; cook and stir until heated through, about 5 minutes.
5. Taste soup, and stir in Worcestershire sauce and soy sauce. If you prefer a thinner soup, add additional chicken stock up to 2 cups. Season with salt and pepper. Garnish with Cheddar cheese.
