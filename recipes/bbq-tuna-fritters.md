## Ingredients

- 1 (5 ounce) can light tuna in water, drained
- 1  egg
- ⅔ cup quick-cooking oats
- 3 tablespoons barbeque sauce
- 3 tablespoons chopped green onion
- ½ teaspoon hot pepper sauce, or to taste
- ½ teaspoon dried savory
- 1 pinch salt
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil

## Instructions

1. In a medium bowl, stir together the tuna, egg and oats until blended. Mix in the barbeque sauce, green onion, hot pepper sauce, savory, and salt.
2. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Spoon tablespoonfuls of the tuna mixture into the pan, and flatten slightly. Smaller patties hold together better. Cook until browned on each side, about 3 minutes per side.
