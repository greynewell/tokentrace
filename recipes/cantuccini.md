## Ingredients

- 9 ounces all-purpose flour
- 9 ounces superfine sugar
- 2 medium eggs
- 1  egg yolk
- ½ teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 ounces roughly chopped hazelnuts
- 1 ½ ounces roughly chopped almonds
- 1 teaspoon whole anise seeds
- 1  egg yolk
- 1 tablespoon water

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Combine flour, sugar, eggs, egg yolk, baking powder, and vanilla extract in a food processor. Blend until the mixture forms a ball, scraping the sides of the bowl once or twice. Turn mixture onto a lightly floured surface and knead in hazelnuts, almonds, and anise seeds.
3. Beat egg yolk and water together in a bowl.
4. Divide dough into 3 pieces and roll into logs about 1 1/2 inches wide. Place onto the prepared baking sheet at least 2 inches apart. Brush with egg yolk-water mixture.
5. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes.
6. Remove from oven and reduce heat to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Cut logs diagonally into 1-inch slices and lay cut-sides down on the baking sheet. Return cantuccini to the oven until dry and firm, 30 to 40 minutes more.
7. Cool on a wire rack and store in an airtight container.
