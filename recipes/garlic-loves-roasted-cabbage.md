## Ingredients

- 1 head cabbage, or more to taste, quartered and cored
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 8 cloves garlic, crushed, or to taste
- ¼ cup olive oil, or to taste
- ¼ cup water  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Center a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
