## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups whole wheat flour
- 1 ½ cups unbleached all-purpose flour
- 1 ¼ cups rolled oats
- ¾ cup brown sugar
- 1 ½ teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2  eggs
- ½ cup honey
- ¼ cup molasses
- 1 cup applesauce
- ½ cup vegetable oil

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 9 inch square baking pans.
2. In a large bowl, stir together the whole wheat flour, white flour, oats, brown sugar, baking powder, and salt. In a separate bowl, stir together the eggs, honey, molasses, applesauce, and vegetable oil. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, and stir until well blended.
