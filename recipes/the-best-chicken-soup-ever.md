## Ingredients

- 1 (2 to 3 pound) whole chicken
- 3 stalks celery with leaves, chopped
- 1 pound baby carrots
- 2  onions, chopped
- 2 cubes beef bouillon, crumbled
- 1 packet
- mix
- 2 (14.5 ounce) cans low-sodium chicken broth
- 1 pinch dried thyme
- 1 pinch poultry seasoning
- 1 pinch dried basil
- 5  black peppercorns
- 2  bay leaves
- 1 pinch dried parsley
- 1 (8 ounce) package farfalle (bow tie) pasta

## Instructions

1. Place chicken into a large pot; cover with water. Add celery leaves. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until chicken is cooked through, 30 to 40 minutes. Remove chicken from the pot and place in a bowl until cool enough to handle.
2. Meanwhile, strain cooking liquid, discard celery leaves, and return cooking liquid to the pot. Place celery, carrots, onion, chicken broth, bouillon, and soup mix into the pot and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Season with peppercorns, bay leaves, thyme, poultry seasoning, basil, and parsley.
3. Bone chicken; cut meat into bite-sized pieces. Add meat to the pot. Simmer until vegetables are tender and flavors are well blended, about 90 minutes.
4. Stir pasta into the pot; cook until noodles are al dente, 10 to 15 minutes. Serve hot.
