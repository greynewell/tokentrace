## Ingredients

- ½ pound thin skirt steak, trimmed of excess fat
- 1 tablespoon Montreal steak seasoning
- ½ pound thin asparagus spears, trimmed
- 1 teaspoon olive oil
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ⅓ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- ½  jarred roasted red pepper, cut into six 1/2-inch strips
- 6  toothpicks
- 1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Butterfly or pound steak with a meat mallet to 1/4-inch thickness. Cut into 6 strips, each approximately 2 inches wide by 5 inches long. Season both sides with Montreal steak seasoning and place in the refrigerator.
2. Preheat a Panasonic Countertop Induction Oven to medium-high on the "Grill" setting.
3. Place asparagus in a shallow dish; drizzle olive oil on top. Season with salt and pepper.
4. Grill asparagus for 2 minutes, turning after 1 minute. Transfer to a plate.
