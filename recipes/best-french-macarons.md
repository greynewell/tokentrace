## Ingredients

- 1 ¾ cups confectioners' sugar
- 1 cup blanched almond flour
- 1 teaspoon salt, divided
- ¼ teaspoon cream of tartar
- 3  egg whites, room temperature
- ¼ cup superfine sugar
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 drops gel food coloring
- 1 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 3 cups confectioners' sugar
- 3 tablespoons heavy cream
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Combine confectioners' sugar, almond flour, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse a few times until extra-fine. Sift through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl.
2. Beat egg whites with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and cream of tartar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment until frothy. Gradually add superfine sugar and vanilla and continue to beat on medium speed until stiff peaks form. Do not overbeat; tips of peaks should hold their shape but curl over slightly.
3. Gently fold 1/3 of the almond flour mixture into the egg whites, turning bowl occasionally, until nearly combined. Drop in food coloring. Add remaining almond flour mixture in 2 additions, gently folding until a batter comes together. Batter should fall off the spatula in thick ribbons without breaking.
4. Transfer batter to a piping bag with a #804 pastry tip. Line 2 light-colored baking sheets with silicone macaron mats. Pipe batter into each circle on the mats. Tap baking sheets 4 times against the counter to release any air bubbles. Let macarons sit at room temperature until dry to the touch, 30 minutes to 1 hour.
5. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
6. Bake macarons in the preheated oven until bottoms rise slightly off the mats to form 'feet', 17 to 20 minutes. Switch baking sheets positions halfway through.
7. Let macarons cool on the mats for 15 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely, at least 15 minutes.
8. Meanwhile, beat butter and confectioners' sugar together using an electric mixer until creamy. Add heavy cream and vanilla extract; beat until combined.
9. Transfer buttercream to a piping bag with a #4 pastry tip. Pipe buttercream onto 1/2 of the macarons. Top with the other halves to create sandwiches.
