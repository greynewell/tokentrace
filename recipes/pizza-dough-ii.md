## Ingredients

- 1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 2 ½ cups warm water (110 degrees F)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 tablespoon salt
- ½ cup whole wheat flour
- 5 ½ cups bread flour

## Instructions

1. Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water in a large bowl. Let sit until creamy, about 10 minutes.
2. Stir whole wheat flour, oil, and salt into yeast mixture, then stir in 4 cups bread flour. Add remaining 1 1/2 cups bread flour, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring well after each addition. When dough pulls together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.
3. Lightly oil a large mixing bowl. Place dough into the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
4. Punch down dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide into thirds and form each piece into a round. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes.
