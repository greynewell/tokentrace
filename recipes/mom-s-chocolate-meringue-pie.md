## Ingredients

- ¾ cup white sugar
- 5 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
- 3 tablespoons cornstarch
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 2 cups milk
- 3  egg yolks, beaten
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 (9 inch) pie crust, baked
- 3  egg whites
- ¼ teaspoon cream of tartar

## Instructions

1. Mix together sugar, cocoa, corn starch and salt in a medium saucepan. Gradually mix in milk. Cook and stir over medium high heat until thickened and bubbly.
