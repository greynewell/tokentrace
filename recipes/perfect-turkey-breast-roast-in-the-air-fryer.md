## Ingredients

- 1 (3 pound) frozen turkey breast roast
- 2 cups water
- ⅓ cup kosher salt
- ⅓ cup brown sugar
- ground black pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons butter, or as needed
- 1 pinch seasoned salt, or to taste (such as Texas Roadhouse®)

## Instructions

1. Thaw frozen turkey breast in the refrigerator for about 24 hours.
2. Bring water to a boil and stir in kosher salt, brown sugar, and pepper. Remove brine from heat and let cool completely, about 30 minutes. Remove turkey breast from wrapper and leave netting in place if possible. Place turkey into a container and cover with cooled brine; add more water if necessary to completely cover, stirring to ensure brine is mixed with water. Let turkey brine for 8 hours, or overnight, in the refrigerator.
3. Preheat an air fryer to 390 degrees F (200 degrees C) according to manufacturer's instructions.
4. Remove turkey and discard the brine. Pat turkey dry. Rub with butter and coat with seasoned salt and pepper.
5. Cook turkey in the preheated air fryer for 15 minutes; turn, remove netting, and season once more. Reduce temperature to 360 degrees F (182 degrees C). Continue to cook for 20 minutes, turning after 15 minutes. Increase temperature to 390 degrees F (200 degrees C), turn, and cook until no longer pink in the center, about 15 minutes more. Remove turkey and let rest for about 5 minutes before cutting and serving.
