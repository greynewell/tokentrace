## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 small red onion, thinly sliced
- 1 (5 ounce) can tuna packed in olive oil, undrained
- 1 tablespoon capers, drained
- ¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
- ½ pound spaghetti
- ½ tablespoon chopped fresh parsley

## Instructions

1. Heat olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add onion and cook until beginning to caramelize, about 10 minutes. Add tuna with oil, capers, and crushed red pepper flakes; heat through.
2. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water for 1 minute less than the package instructs, about 10 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking. Drain, reserving 1/2 cup of the starchy pasta water.
3. Add the cooked pasta to the pan and mix to combine. Add some of the pasta water and toss lightly until the pasta is tender yet firm to the bite, 1 to 2 more minutes. Sprinkle with chopped parsley and serve immediately.
