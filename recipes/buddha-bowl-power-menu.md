## Ingredients

- 1 cup raw cashews
- 6  dates, pitted
- 1 tablespoon flaxseed meal
- ⅛ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 pinch salt
- 1 tablespoon coconut oil
- 1 cup water
- ½ cup brown rice
- 1 pinch salt
- ½ cup fresh fava beans, shelled
- ¼  red bell pepper, diced
- ¼ cup frozen peas
- ¼ cup diced Swiss cheese
- ¼ cup canned artichoke hearts, drained and chopped
- 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 teaspoon white wine vinegar
- 1  hard-boiled egg
- ½ cup plain yogurt
- ¼  avocado, diced
- 2 tablespoons pomegranate seeds
- 1 teaspoon chia seeds
- ¼ cup frozen blueberries
- 2 tablespoons pomegranate seeds
- 3 jasmine flower buds
- 2 cups water

## Instructions

1. Combine cashews, dates, flaxseed meal, cinnamon, and 1 pinch salt in a food processor and blend until very well mixed. Add coconut oil and continue to blend until mixture sticks together. Roll into 20 gumball-sized bites and place on a baking tray. Freeze at least 30 minutes. Store cinnamon energy bites in freezer or refrigerator until ready to serve.
2. Bring water, brown rice, and 1 pinch salt to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 8 minutes. Add fava beans, red bell pepper, and peas. Cook until rice is tender, about 6 minutes more. Drain if necessary, but do not rinse. Allow to cool completely, about 30 minutes.
3. Combine cooled cooked rice, Swiss cheese, and artichoke hearts in a bowl. Mix olive oil, mustard, and white wine vinegar together in a small bowl; pour dressing over rice mixture and toss. Transfer to a bento box with the hard-boiled egg.
4. Place yogurt in a separate compartment of the bento box and top with avocado, 2 tablespoons pomegranate seeds, and chia seeds. Add energy bites to another compartment of the bento box. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
5. Combine blueberries, 2 tablespoons pomegranate seeds, and jasmine buds in a portable drink container. Add water. Refrigerate 8 hours to overnight. Serve with the bento box.
