## Ingredients

- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided
- 2 large onions, very thinly sliced
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1  bay leaf
- 1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 (16 ounce) package elbow macaroni
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 cup beef broth
- 1 cup milk
- 1 pinch freshly grated nutmeg, or to taste
- ¾ pound shredded Gruyere cheese

## Instructions

1. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir onions, thyme, and bay leaf in the butter for 5 minutes; season with salt and pepper. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook until onions are browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer to a plate and discard the bay leaf. Reserve the skillet.
2. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, melt remaining butter in the reserved skillet over medium heat. Whisk in flour for 1 minute, then whisk in beef broth and milk and bring to a boil; season with nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Reduce heat and cook until thickened, about 5 minutes. Stir in Gruyere cheese until melted.
4. Drain macaroni and toss with onion and sauce until well combined.
