## Ingredients

- 12  frozen dinner rolls (such as Rhodes®)
- cooking spray
- ½ cup white sugar
- ½ cup brown sugar
- 3 tablespoons ground cinnamon
- ¼ cup butter, melted
- 2  apple - peeled, cored, and chopped
- ¼ cup golden raisins
- ½ cup cream cheese, at room temperature
- ½ cup confectioners' sugar
- 3 tablespoons heavy whipping cream, or more as needed
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Put frozen rolls on a baking sheet, spray a piece of plastic wrap with cooking spray and place over rolls. Let rise until doubled in size, about 3 hours.
2. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners.
3. Mix white sugar, brown sugar, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Place melted butter in a small bowl.
4. Grab approximately 1 tablespoon of thawed and risen dough and roll into a ball. Dip the ball in the melted butter and roll in the cinnamon-sugar mixture. Repeat to fill each muffin liner with 3 buttered and sugared dough balls.
5. Combine apples and raisins in a bowl. Sprinkle about 1 teaspoon apple-raisin mixture over each muffin.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 25 minutes.
7. Beat cream cheese, confectioners' sugar, whipping cream, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until glaze is smooth, 3 to 5 minutes. Drizzle glaze over muffins.
