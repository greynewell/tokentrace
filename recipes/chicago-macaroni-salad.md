## Ingredients

- 1 (8 ounce) package salad macaroni
- 1 cup small broccoli florets
- ¾ cup diced Cheddar cheese
- ½ cup chopped green bell pepper
- ½ cup dill pickle relish, with juice
- 1 large dill pickle, chopped
- ½ cup chopped celery
- ½ cup sliced black olives
- ½ cup sliced green olives  (Optional)
- ¼ cup chopped green onion
- 2 tablespoons shredded carrot
- 1 tablespoon chopped pimento peppers
- 1 cup light mayonnaise
- ¼ cup prepared yellow mustard
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon white sugar
- ¼ teaspoon black pepper

## Instructions

1. Fill a pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the salad macaroni, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink, and rinse with cold water until chilled. Drain again to remove excess water.
2. Place macaroni, broccoli, Cheddar cheese, green pepper, pickle relish, dill pickle, celery, black olives, green olives, green onion, carrot, and pimento in a salad bowl, and toss lightly to combine. In a bowl, whisk together the light mayonnaise, mustard, salt, sugar, and black pepper to make a smooth dressing; pour the dressing over the salad, and lightly mix to coat all ingredients with dressing. Refrigerate at least 4 hours to blend flavors before serving.
