## Ingredients

- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- ⅛ teaspoon ground cloves
- ⅛ teaspoon ground allspice
- ⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ⅛ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 (4 pound) whole chicken
- 5 cloves garlic, crushed

## Instructions

1. Mix salt, sugar, cloves, allspice, nutmeg, and cinnamon together in a small bowl until combined. Rub chicken all over with spice mixture. Transfer chicken to a large bowl, cover, and refrigerate for 24 hours.
2. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).
3. Place chicken, breast-side down, on a rack in a roasting pan. Stuff chicken cavity with crushed garlic.
4. Roast chicken in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) and continue roasting for 15 minutes more. Baste chicken with pan drippings; reduce heat to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) and continue roasting for 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
