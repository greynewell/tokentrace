## Ingredients

- 4  eggs
- ½ cup white sugar
- 1 pinch salt
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 cups whole milk
- 3 tablespoons butter
- 1 (9 inch) refrigerated pie crust

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C.)
2. In a large bowl, combine eggs, sugar, salt and vanilla. Mix just enough to incorporate all the ingredients. Set aside. In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, combine milk and butter. Use a wire whisk and stir constantly until the milk begins to rise in the saucepan at a rapid boil - 5 to 8 minutes. NEVER stop stirring, or the milk will burn. Pour the hot mixture into the egg mixture, stirring as you pour.
3. Line a 9 inch pan with dough. Pour custard mixture into crust. Protect the edges of crust with a ring of aluminum foil.
4. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Remove foil and bake for 8 to 10 minutes. Filling will appear slightly jiggly. Allow to cool.
