## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 5 pounds trimmed beef cheeks
- 1 large onion, diced small
- 1  carrot, diced small
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 4 cups beef stock
- 1 cup red wine
- ⅓ cup dried porcini mushrooms
- 2 cubes beef bouillon
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 2  bay leaves

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C).
2. Heat olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add beef in batches and cook until browned, about 4 minutes per side. Add onion and carrot; cook until tender, about 20 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes.
3. Pour beef stock and wine into the Dutch oven; bring to a boil. Stir in porcini mushrooms, bouillon cubes, thyme, and bay leaves. Lay a piece of parchment paper over the surface. Cover with a tight lid.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until beef is very tender, 5 to 6 hours.
