## Ingredients

- Pot Roast:
- 1 (3 pound) beef chuck roast
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 4 (10.5 ounce) cans condensed beef broth (such as Campbell's®)
- 1 cup water
- 1  white onion, cut into large wedges
- 5 cloves garlic
- 1 (16 ounce) package carrots, peeled
- 1 sprig fresh rosemary
- Mashed Potatoes:
- 5 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and diced
- 1 (12 ounce) can evaporated milk, or as needed
- ½ cup butter

## Instructions

1. Season beef chuck roast with salt and black pepper; sear in a large, deep skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat until browned, about 10 minutes per side.
2. Pour beef broth and water into the skillet with roast. Arrange onion wedges and garlic cloves around beef; spread carrots atop and place sprig of rosemary atop carrots. Turn heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 6 hours.
