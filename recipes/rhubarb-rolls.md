## Ingredients

- 1 cup water
- 1 cup sugar
- 3 tablespoons butter
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 3 teaspoons baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ½ cup butter
- ¾ cup milk
- 3 cups finely chopped rhubarb
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 cup sugar

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch pan.
2. Bring water to a boil in a small saucepan. Dissolve 1 cup sugar in boiling water, then add 3 tablespoons butter. Remove from heat, and set syrup aside to cool.
