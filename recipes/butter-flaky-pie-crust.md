## Ingredients

- 1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ½ cup butter, chilled and diced
- ¼ cup ice water

## Instructions

1. Combine flour and salt in a large bowl. Use a pasty blender to cut in chilled, diced butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
2. Add 1 tablespoon cold water at a time, mixing with a spatula or your hands until the dough comes together; you may need less than 1/4 cup water. Shape dough into a disc, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight.
3. Place chilled dough on a generously floured surface and roll out to an 11-inch circle, adding more flour to your rolling pin as needed. Carefully roll dough onto the rolling pin, then unroll over a 9-inch pie dish. Press dough evenly into the bottom and sides of the dish. Trim any excess dough and flute the edges.
4. Blind-bake or fill and bake as directed in your pie recipe.
