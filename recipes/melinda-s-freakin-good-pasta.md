## Ingredients

- 1 (16 ounce) package fettuccine noodles
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2  zucchini, shredded
- 5 cloves garlic, minced, divided
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
- 1  onion, sliced
- 2 cups cherry tomatoes
- 1 (4 ounce) log goat cheese, crumbled
- ¼ cup chopped fresh basil, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil.
2. Stir in the fettuccine, bring back to a boil, and cook pasta over medium heat until cooked through but still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain water, reserving 1 cup pasta water.
3. Melt butter in a large skillet or frying pan over medium heat; add zucchini, 3 cloves minced garlic, salt, and pepper.
4. Cook and stir zucchini mixture in the melted butter until most of the moisture has evaporated, 10 to 15 minutes.
5. Heat olive oil in a separate skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion until softened, 5 to 10 minutes.
6. Add cherry tomatoes, remaining 2 cloves minced garlic, salt, and pepper to onion; cook and stir, crushing tomatoes to desired consistency, until heated through, about 5 minutes.
7. Mix fettuccine and zucchini mixture into onion mixture, adding as much reserved pasta water to keep pasta moist.
8. Stir goat cheese and basil into pasta mixture.
