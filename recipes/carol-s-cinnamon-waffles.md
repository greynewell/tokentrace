## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- ¼ cup white sugar
- ½ cup brown sugar
- 2 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 4 teaspoons baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1 ¾ cups milk
- ½ cup vegetable oil
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2  egg whites
- cooking spray

## Instructions

1. Whisk flour, white sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl until no lumps remain.
2. Pour milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract into the flour mixture; stir until just combined.
3. Beat egg whites until foamy in a large glass or metal mixing bowl until soft peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites will form soft mounds rather than a sharp peak.

5. Preheat a waffle iron and coat with cooking spray.
