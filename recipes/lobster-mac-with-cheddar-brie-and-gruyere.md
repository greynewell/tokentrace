## Ingredients

- 1 (16 ounce) package uncooked elbow macaroni
- ¼ cup butter, divided
- 2  shallots, finely chopped
- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 2 cups milk

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

5. Stir flour into shallot mixture and cook for 1 minute; whisk in milk.
6. Bring milk mixture to a gentle boil, whisking constantly.
7. Set aside a large pinch of the Cheddar cheese, Gruyere cheese, and a few cubes of the Brie cheese to use for topping.
8. Stir Dijon mustard and remaining Cheddar cheese, Gruyere cheese, and Brie cheese into milk mixture; remove from heat and stir until all cheese is melted, about 2 minutes; season with salt and pepper.
9. Stir macaroni and lobster meat into cheese mixture; pour into a baking dish.
10. Whisk panko bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, and reserved Cheddar and Gruyere cheese together in a bowl; sprinkle over the top of lobster mixture.
11. Cut remaining 1 tablespoon butter and reserved Brie cheese into tiny pieces and scatter evenly over crumb mixture.
12. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and golden, about 20 minutes.
