## Ingredients

- 2 slices bacon, chopped
- 1 cup peeled and cubed potatoes
- ⅓ cup chopped onion
- 1 cup chopped assorted mushrooms
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon onion powder
- 1 ½ cups water
- ½ cup milk
- 1 sprig fresh thyme
- 1 ½ tablespoons all-purpose flour
- salt and coarsely ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Fry bacon in a stockpot over medium heat until it is semi-crispy, about 5 minutes. Stir in potatoes and onion and cook until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Mix in mushrooms, garlic powder, and onion powder; cook and stir until mushrooms have softened, about 5 minutes more.
