## Ingredients

- 1 (18.25 ounce) package white cake mix with pudding
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 cup sugar
- ¼ cup instant chai latte powder
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 8 ounces sour cream
- 1 cup melted butter
- 3 large eggs
- ¼ cup heavy whipping cream
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- 1 cup unsalted butter
- 4 cups confectioners' sugar, sifted
- 3 tablespoons chai-flavored coffee creamer, or more to taste
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
