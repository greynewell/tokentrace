## Ingredients

- ¼ large lemon
- 1 (6 ounce) tilapia fillet, patted dry
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 teaspoon butter, divided
- ¼ large red onion, coarsely chopped
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic
- 1 tablespoon grated fresh Parmesan cheese

## Instructions

1. Squeeze lemon juice over tilapia; season lightly with salt and black pepper.
2. Heat olive oil in a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Melt 1/2 teaspoon butter in hot oil. Add chopped onion and minced garlic; cook and stir until onion begins to look translucent, about 5 minutes.
3. Reduce heat to medium-low. Push onion mixture to sides of the skillet. Melt remaining 1/2 teaspoon of butter in the skillet. Place tilapia in the center of the skillet and cover with onion mixture. Cover skillet and cook tilapia until it starts to turn golden, about 5 minutes. Push onion mixture to the sides again and flip tilapia. Cover and cook until second side is golden and flakes easily with a fork, about 5 minutes more.
4. Remove skillet from heat. Top tilapia with grated Parmesan cheese, cover, and let stand until cheese is melted, 2 to 3 minutes.
