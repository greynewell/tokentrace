## Ingredients

- 1 cup white sugar
- ½ cup shortening
- ½ cup buttermilk
- 1  egg
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup confectioners' sugar, or more as needed
- 1 tablespoon milk, or more as needed

## Instructions

1. Mix sugar, shortening, buttermilk, and egg together in the bowl of an electric stand mixer (such as KitchenAid®) until creamy.
2. Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, vanilla extract, and salt in a bowl. Beat into sugar mixture, 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well after each addition. Leave dough to set in a refrigerator for at least 2 hours to overnight.
3. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
4. Roll dough out on a lightly floured work surface using a lightly floured rolling pin to desired thickness. Cut into shapes using cookie cutters and place onto ungreased cookie sheets.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until bottoms begin to lightly brown, 8 to 12 minutes. Let cookies cool completely on wax paper or a wire rack, 15 to 30 minutes.
6. Combine confectioners' sugar and milk in a bowl. Mix into a paste, adding more sugar or milk as needed. Spread frosting thinly onto cooled cookies and cover with sprinkles.
