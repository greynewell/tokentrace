## Ingredients

- ¼ cup minced garlic
- ¼ cup soy sauce
- ½ cup honey
- 2 tablespoons garlic powder
- 3 tablespoons onion powder
- 1 ½ teaspoons chili powder  (Optional)
- 3 pounds ground moose
- 2 tablespoons canola oil

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Stir together honey, garlic, and soy sauce in a small saucepan, then stir in onion, garlic, and chili powders. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and gently simmer for 15 minutes.
3. While the sauce is simmering, roll 2 tablespoons ground moose into a ball. Repeat to make remaining meatballs.
4. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook meatballs in batches until well browned and cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes per batch; drain well.
5. Transfer drained meatballs to a large baking dish. Pour in sauce and stir until meatballs are well coated.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until meatballs absorb some sauce and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the centers reads 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), about 20 minutes.
