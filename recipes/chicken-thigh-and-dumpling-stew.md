## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons butter
- 2 pounds chicken thighs
- 8 slices bacon
- 2 stalks celery, chopped
- 3  carrots, chopped
- 1  red onion, finely chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- 1 (14 ounce) can vegetable broth
- ½ teaspoon paprika
- ½ cup heavy cream
- 1 (26 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup
- 1 cup water
- 1 (8.75 ounce) can sweet corn, drained
- ground black pepper to taste
- 1 (10 ounce) can buttermilk biscuits

## Instructions

1. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chicken in hot butter on both sides until just cooked through. Transfer chicken to a plate and allow to cool slightly. Scrape chicken drippings into a large stockpot; set the stockpot aside. Use forks to pull chicken meat from the bones and chop into small pieces or shred; set aside.
2. Place bacon in the same large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels; crumble and set aside. Reserve 1 tablespoon bacon drippings.
3. Place the large stockpot with chicken drippings over medium-high heat. Cook and stir carrots, celery, onion, and garlic in hot chicken drippings until onion is soft and transparent. Add vegetable broth, chicken, and reserved bacon grease; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer for 12 minutes.
4. Stir in condensed soup, water, heavy cream, and paprika. Cook, stirring occasionally, until heated through, about 5 minutes. Stir in corn; season with pepper.
5. Tear each biscuit into quarters and drop into stew. Reduce heat to medium-low; stir occasionally until dough is cooked through and forms dumplings on the top of stew, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and garnish servings with crumbled bacon.
