## Ingredients

- 1 ½ pounds ground beef
- 1 ½ pounds ground pork
- 2 cups dry bread crumbs
- 1 cup finely chopped sweet onion (such as Vidalia®)
- 1  egg, beaten
- 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic
- 1 teaspoon dried tarragon
- 1 teaspoon sea salt
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ cup barbeque sauce
- ½ cup ketchup

## Instructions

1. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and scrape the grates clean. Spray grates with nonstick cooking spray.
2. In a bowl, mix together the ground beef, ground pork, bread crumbs, onion, egg, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, tarragon, sea salt, and black pepper. Divide the mixture in half, and form 2 loaves, each about 4 inches in diameter and 6 inches long. In a small bowl, mix the barbecue sauce with ketchup until well combined.
3. Place each meatloaf directly on the prepared grill grates, then spread each with about 3 tablespoons of barbecue sauce mixture; grill until the loaves reach an internal temperature of at least 160 degrees F (73 degrees C), about 1 hour.
