## Ingredients

- 2  eggs
- 1 ½ teaspoons reduced-fat sour cream
- ¼ cup shredded reduced-fat Cheddar cheese
- 2 tablespoons finely chopped onion
- 1 ½ teaspoons prepared pesto sauce
- 3  grape tomatoes, sliced
- 1 slice turkey bacon
- ½ ounce marinated artichoke hearts, drained and thinly sliced
- 1  10-inch flour tortilla
- salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Beat the eggs in a bowl with the sour cream until blended, and stir in the Cheddar cheese.
2. Spray a skillet with cooking spray, and cook and stir the onion and pesto sauce over medium heat until the onion is translucent, about 6 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes, and pour the egg mixture into the skillet. Cook and stir the egg mixture until the eggs are cooked but not dry, about 3 minutes. Remove eggs from the skillet, and set aside.
3. Place the turkey bacon into the skillet, and fry, flipping once, until the bacon is thoroughly cooked and starting to crisp, about 3 minutes per side. When the bacon is cooked, place the artichokes into the skillet to heat for about 1 minute, and remove the bacon and artichokes from the pan.
4. Spray the skillet with cooking spray, and place the tortilla into the hot skillet. Heat the tortilla until warm and flexible, and remove to a plate.
5. Spoon the eggs, turkey bacon, and artichokes into the center of the tortilla, and season with salt and pepper. Fold the bottom 2 inches of the tortilla up to enclose the filling, and wrap tightly.
