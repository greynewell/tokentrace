## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups butter, softened
- 6 tablespoons white sugar
- 1 cup cornstarch
- 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 6 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
- 2 teaspoons grated lemon peel
- 2 cups powdered sugar
- 1 cup butter, softened
- 2 teaspoons grated lemon peel
- 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
- 3 drops yellow food coloring, or as desired  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Combine butter and sugar for cookies in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until fluffy. Mix in cornstarch. Add flour, lemon juice, and lemon peel; beat on low speed until a soft dough forms. Shape dough into a 2-inch diameter log. Wrap in waxed paper and chill in the refrigerator until firm, 1 to 2 hours.
2. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
3. Remove dough from refrigerator and cut into 1/4-inch slices. Place cookies on an ungreased cookie sheet.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until firm, about 10 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 1 minute before removing to a wire rack to cool, 8 to 10 minutes more. Repeat with remaining dough.
5. While cookies are baking, combine powdered sugar, butter, lemon peel, lemon juice, and food coloring for frosting in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until smooth. Spread frosting onto cooled cookies. Let frosting dry completely before storing.
