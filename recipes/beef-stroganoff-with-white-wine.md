## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons butter
- 1 (8 ounce) package sliced mushrooms
- 1 large onion, diced
- 4 cloves garlic, diced
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 ½ pounds beef sirloin steak, cut into 1 inch cubes
- 1 cup white wine
- 2 cups beef bouillon
- 1 teaspoon crumbled dried thyme
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- ½ teaspoon dried oregano
- 2  bay leaves
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- 2 cups half-and-half cream

## Instructions

1. Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook and stir the mushrooms, onion and garlic in the butter until tender. Reserving the liquid in the saucepan, remove the mushroom mixture to a bowl. Return the butter mixture to medium-high heat.

Stir the wine, beef bouillon, thyme, basil, oregano, bay leaves, and pepper; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 10 minutes.
