## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 7 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 3 tablespoons ice-cold water, or as needed
- 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard, or more to taste
- 1 cup grated Gruyere cheese
- 3 large tomatoes, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch slices

4. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 15 minutes.
5. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).

9. If tomatoes are very juicy, drain some of the liquid.
10. Arrange tomato slices like roof tiles on the cheese.
