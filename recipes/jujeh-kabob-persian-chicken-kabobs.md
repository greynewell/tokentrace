## Ingredients

- 1 medium onion, sliced thin
- 1  lime, juiced
- 1  lemon, juiced
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- ⅓ teaspoon crushed saffron
- ¼ cup olive oil
- 3 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch cubes
- metal skewers

## Instructions

1. Combine onion, lime juice, lemon juice, salt, pepper, and saffron in a large glass bowl. Mix in olive oil. Press chicken into the bowl lightly and cover with plastic wrap. Let marinate for 6 hours to overnight, mixing every few hours to make sure chicken is coated.
2. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
3. Remove chicken from the bowl, shake off excess marinade, and discard marinade left in the bowl. Place chicken onto metal skewers, making sure it's not too tightly packed.
4. Cook skewers on the preheated grill until chicken is browned and no longer pink in the center, turning as needed, 10 to 15 minutes total.
