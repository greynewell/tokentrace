## Ingredients

- 1 cup cake flour
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ⅛ teaspoon baking powder
- ½ cup butter, softened
- ½ cup white sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 24  whole pecans

## Instructions

1. Sift cake flour, salt, and baking powder into a medium bowl.
2. Combine butter, sugar, and vanilla extract in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Add dry ingredients and mix thoroughly. Shape dough into a 1-inch diameter log, wrap with plastic wrap, and place in the refrigerator until firm, 1 hour to overnight.
