## Ingredients

- 2 pounds beef stew meat, cubed
- 3 cups dry red wine
- 3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 6 slices center-cut bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
- 3 medium potatoes, peeled and quartered
- 3 medium carrots, peeled and chopped into 1/2-inch pieces
- 6 ounces fresh green beans, trimmed and halved
- 1 stalk celery, chopped into 1/2-inch pieces
- 2 cloves garlic, peeled, or more to taste
- 4 cups low-sodium beef broth
- 1 (15 ounce) can Italian-style stewed tomatoes
- 1 teaspoon dried rosemary
- ½ teaspoon dried sage
- ¾ cup sliced portobello mushrooms
- 4 tablespoons tapioca flour, or as needed  (Optional)
- 4 tablespoons cold water, or as needed  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Marinate the beef in red wine in a 9x13-inch glass baking dish in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours, turning the meat over halfway through marinating time.
2. Remove beef from the wine and pat dry with paper towels. Reserve the wine.
3. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Season beef on all sides with salt and pepper. Brown in the hot oil, about 2 minutes on each side. Remove meat, drain the pot, and add bacon. Cook until semi-crisp and browned, about 5 minutes. Drain bacon grease but do not wipe the pot clean.
4. Drizzle remaining oil into the pot and add potatoes, carrots, green beans, celery, and garlic. Cook and stir for 3 minutes. Pour reserved wine, beef broth, and tomatoes into the pot, scraping up the browned bits that cling to the bottom with a wooden spoon. Add rosemary and sage. Return the meat to the pot and bring the liquid to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and let simmer until meat is very tender and no longer pink, 3 to 3 1/2 hours, adding mushrooms during the last 1 hour of cooking time.
5. Combine tapioca and cold water in a bowl. Mix into the stew to thicken as desired.
