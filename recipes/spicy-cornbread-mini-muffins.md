## Ingredients

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 cup yellow cornmeal
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 4 teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 ½ cups finely shredded Cheddar cheese
- 1 cup milk
- 2  eggs
- ¼ cup vegetable oil
- 3  canned jalapeno peppers - stems and seeds removed and peppers finely diced
- ¼ teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 tablespoon butter, melted - divided
- 3 tablespoons yellow cornmeal, or as needed - divided

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Whisk flour, 1 cup cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, salt, and garlic powder together in a bowl. Mix Cheddar cheese into dry ingredients until coated.
3. Beat milk, eggs, vegetable oil, jalapeno peppers, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl until well mixed. Make a well in the Cheddar cheese mixture and pour egg mixture into the well; stir just until combined. Batter should be slightly lumpy.
4. Brush 18 mini muffin cups with melted butter; spoon about 1 teaspoon cornmeal into each mini muffin cup, tilt pan to coat muffin cups with cornmeal, and tap out the excess. Spoon batter into each muffin cup to about 2/3 full.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 11 to 12 minutes. Allow to cool 5 minutes in the pans before removing to finish cooling.
