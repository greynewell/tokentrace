## Ingredients

- 3 ¼ cups white sugar
- ¾ pound unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 6 extra large eggs, at room temperature
- 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1 cup 1% milk

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour a 12-cup fluted tube pan (such as Bundt).
2. Cream sugar and butter in a large mixing bowl on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, beating for 45 seconds after each addition. Add vanilla extract and beat for 30 seconds.
3. Combine flour, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg in a medium bowl. Add 1/2 of the flour mixture to the butter mixture and mix on low speed until just blended. Add 1/2 cup milk and beat on low speed until just blended. Scrape the sides of the bowl with a spatula between each addition. Repeat with remaining flour mixture and milk.
4. Pour batter into the prepared baking pan, filling no more than 2/3 full. Smooth the top with a spoon or a spatula.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean and the cake is just starting to pull away from the sides of the pan, about 1 hour and 25 minutes.
6. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for about 15 minutes before inverting onto a plate. Allow to cool completely before serving.
