## Ingredients

- 2 pounds boneless country-style ribs, or more as desired
- ¼ teaspoon garlic powder, or to taste
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1  red onion, sliced
- 2 cups barbeque sauce (such as Famous Dave's®)

## Instructions

1. Season ribs with garlic powder, salt, and pepper.
2. Place a layer of onion in the bottom of a pressure cooker. Add a layer of ribs. Repeat with remaining onion and ribs.
