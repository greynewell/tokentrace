## Ingredients

- vegetable oil cooking spray
- 2 cups fresh blueberries
- 2  bananas, mashed
- 2 large eggs
- 2 tablespoons flax seed meal
- 2 tablespoons wheat germ
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 cup rolled oats
- 1 cup whole milk
- ½ cup white sugar
- ½ cup vegetable oil
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¾ cup packed brown sugar
- ½ cup chopped pecans
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
- 1 cup confectioners' sugar
- 3 teaspoons whole milk, or more to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking pan with cooking spray.
2. Combine blueberries, bananas, eggs, flax seed, and wheat germ in a large bowl; mix by hand with a wire whisk until combined. Add flour, oats, milk, sugar, oil, vanilla extract, baking powder, baking soda, and salt; gently mix by hand for 2 minutes until thoroughly combined.
3. Combine brown sugar, pecans, flour, and cinnamon for the topping in a medium bowl; mix with a fork until combined. Add melted butter; stir well.
4. Pour 2/3 of the cake batter into the prepared pan and sprinkle with 1/2 of the topping. Gently ladle the rest of the cake batter over top, and sprinkle with remaining topping.
5. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue baking until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes more. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 15 minutes.
6. While the cake is cooling, combine confectioners' sugar and milk in a bowl. Whisk to desired consistency, adding more milk if necessary. Drizzle over warm cake and serve immediately.
