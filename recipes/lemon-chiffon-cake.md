## Ingredients

- 1 ¾ cups cake flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ cup white sugar
- ½ cup vegetable oil
- 6  egg yolks
- ¾ cup water
- 1 tablespoon lemon zest
- 6  egg whites
- ½ teaspoon cream of tartar
- ¾ cup white sugar
- 1 cup heavy whipping cream
- 2 ½ cups lemon pie filling
- 8 slices  lemon

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. In a large bowl, combine flour, baking powder, salt, and 1/2 cup sugar. Add oil, egg yolks, water and lemon rind. Beat with an electric mixer until smooth.
3. In a small bowl, beat egg whites and cream of tartar until peaks form. Gradually add 3/4 cup sugar, and beat until very stiff and shiny peaks form. Fold 1/3 of the whites into the batter, then quickly fold in remaining whites until no streaks remain. Turn batter into ungreased 10-inch tube pan.
