## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 1 cup gluten-free flour blend (such as Namaste Perfect Flour Blend)
- 1 cup chopped pecans
- 7 tablespoons butter, melted, or more as needed
- ¼ cup packed brown sugar
- 3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, at room temperature
- ⅔ cup sugar, or more to taste
- ⅛ teaspoon salt
- 3  eggs
- 1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract
- ½ teaspoon lemon extract, or more to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a muffin tin with cooking spray.
2. Mix flour, pecans, butter, and brown sugar together in a bowl until mixture has a sandy texture. Drop a heaping tablespoon of the mixture into the bottom of each muffin cup; press to create a flat and even crust.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until crust is dry, about 12 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
4. Beat cream cheese in a large bowl with an electric mixer on low speed until very creamy. Add sugar and salt; mix well. Beat in eggs one at a time until smooth. Beat in vanilla extract and lemon extract.
5. Pour cream cheese mixture evenly over each crust.
6. Bake cheesecakes in the preheated oven until set, about 20 minutes. Let cool completely, about 20 minutes. Cover and refrigerate until firm, at least 2 hours.
