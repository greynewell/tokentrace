## Ingredients

- 1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
- ¾ teaspoon baking soda
- 1 pinch salt
- 5 tablespoons butter, cut into chunks
- ⅔ cup milk
- 1 cup white sugar
- 2  eggs
- 1  egg yolk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ½ cup shredded coconut
- ¼ cup butter, softened
- 4 ounces cream cheese, softened
- 1 cup confectioners' sugar
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon grated lemon zest
- ¼ cup shredded coconut, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners.
2. Mix flour, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl.
3. Heat 5 tablespoons butter and milk together in a saucepan over low heat until butter is melted, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat.
4. Beat white sugar, eggs, egg yolk, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract together in a bowl using an electric hand mixer on low until mixture is smooth and thickened. Slowly pour flour mixture into sugar-egg mixture while mixing with the electric mixer until just incorporated. Slowly add butter-milk mixture; beat until just combined. Fold in 1/2 cup shredded coconut. Fill muffin cups with batter.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a cupcake comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
6. Beat softened butter and cream cheese together in a bowl using an electric mixer on medium. Gradually beat confectioners' sugar into creamed butter mixture on low until incorporated. Beat in 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract and lemon zest until smooth and creamy. Spread frosting over cooled cupcakes; sprinkle about 1 teaspoon shredded coconut onto each cupcake.
