## Ingredients

- 1 pound carrots, peeled
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- ½ teaspoon garlic salt
- ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese, or more to taste

2. Stir olive oil and garlic salt together in a small bowl; pour into a large resealable plastic bag. Add carrots to the plastic bag, seal, and shake to coat carrots completely in oil mixture. Arrange coated carrots onto the prepared baking sheet.
