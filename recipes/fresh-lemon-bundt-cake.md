## Ingredients

- 1 cup butter, softened
- 2 cups white sugar
- 5 large eggs
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- ¼ cup fresh lemon juice
- 1  large lemon, zested

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour a fluted tube pan (such as a Bundt®).
2. Beat butter and sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy. The mixture should be noticeably lighter in color. Add eggs one at a time, alternating with flour, allowing each egg and portion of flour to blend into the butter mixture before adding the next. Stir lemon juice and zest into flour mixture until batter is just combined; pour into prepared pan.
3. Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 45 to 55 minutes.
