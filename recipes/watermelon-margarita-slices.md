## Ingredients

- 1 large seedless watermelon
- 1 (750 milliliter) bottle tequila
- 1 (750 milliliter) bottle orange liqueur
- 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice, or more to taste

## Instructions

1. Wash the outside of your watermelon and place it on a plate so that it doesn't roll - you may need to slice off some of the rind to make a flat spot.
2. Trace the lids from the tequila and orange liquor bottles on either side of the melon. Then cut out with a sharp knife. Insert bottles into the watermelon and do not disturb for 48 hours.
3. Remove liquor bottles. Cut watermelon into slices and drizzle with lime juice.
