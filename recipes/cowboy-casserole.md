## Ingredients

- ½ pound bacon
- 1 pound ground beef
- 1 small onion, chopped
- 2 (15 ounce) cans baked beans with pork
- ⅓ cup barbeque sauce
- 1 (7.5 ounce) package refrigerated biscuit dough

## Instructions

1. Cook bacon in a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat until evenly browned. Drain, and cut into bite size pieces. Set aside. Add hamburger and onion to the skillet, and cook until no longer pink, and the onion is tender. Drain.
2. Stir bacon, baked beans and barbeque sauce into the ground beef, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium low, and place biscuits in a single layer over the top of the mixture. Cover, and simmer for about 10 minutes, or until the biscuits are done. Place two biscuits on each plate, and spoon beans over.
