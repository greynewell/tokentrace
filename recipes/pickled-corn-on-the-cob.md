## Ingredients

- 6 ears corn - husked, cleaned and quartered
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 3 cups white vinegar
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 tablespoon pickling spice
- 2  bay leaves
- 1 (3 inch) cinnamon stick

## Instructions

1. Rinse corn and place in a large bowl with salt and enough water to cover. Refrigerate until needed. Sterilize two 1-quart jars in simmering water for 5 minutes.
2. In a large stock pot, stir together vinegar, sugar, and pickling spice. Add bay leaves and cinnamon stick. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally to be sure the sugar has dissolved.
3. Drain and rinse corn under cold water. Add to the pot with the pickling mixture. Return to a boil, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove corn with a slotted spoon, and fill the sterile jars. Remove cinnamon stick and bay leaves from the liquid and discard. Fill the jars of corn with the vinegar mixture to within 1/2 inch of the top. Corn should be completely covered. Wipe the rims of the jars with a clean cloth. Seal with lids and rings.
4. Process the jars in a hot water bath for the time recommended by your local extension in your area. Most areas require about 10 minutes in a water bath of 180 degrees F (82 degrees C). Refrigerate after opening.
