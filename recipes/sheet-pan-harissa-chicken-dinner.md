## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons harissa sauce, divided
- 4 (5 ounce) bone-in chicken thighs, or more to taste
- 8 ounces multicolored carrots, peeled, halved lengthwise and crosswise
- 8 ounces cauliflower florets
- 8 ounces baby potatoes, halved
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- ½ teaspoon kosher salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- ½ teaspoon grated orange zest

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Spoon 1 teaspoon harissa sauce under the skin of each thigh, then transfer to an aluminum foil-lined 10x15-inch baking pan. Spread carrots, cauliflower, and potatoes onto the pan. Drizzle evenly with oil, then sprinkle with salt and pepper.
3. Roast, uncovered, in the preheated oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted in thickest parts of chicken registers 175 degrees F (80 degrees C), 40 to 55 minutes. Stir vegetables once halfway through.
4. Stir together parsley, garlic, and zest in a small bowl.
5. Toss vegetables with remaining 2 teaspoons harissa sauce. Sprinkle with parsley mixture.
