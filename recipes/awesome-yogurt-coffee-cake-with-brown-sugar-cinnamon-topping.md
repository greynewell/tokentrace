## Ingredients

- 1 cup packed brown sugar
- ½ cup chopped walnuts
- ½ cup chopped pecans
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- ¼ cup softened butter
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- Cake:
- cooking spray
- 1 ½ cups white sugar
- 1 cup yogurt
- ¾ cup softened butter
- 2  eggs
- ⅓ cup milk
- 4 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 3 cups all-purpose flour

## Instructions

1. Mix together brown sugar, walnuts, pecans, flour, butter, and cinnamon for the topping in a bowl until crumbly; set aside.
2. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a fluted tube pan (such as Bundt®) with cooking spray.
3. Combine sugar, yogurt, butter, eggs, milk, baking powder, and salt for the cake in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until smooth. Slowly mix in flour until combined; batter will be thick. Pour 1/2 of the batter into the bottom of the prepared pan. Generously spread 1/2 of the brown sugar-cinnamon topping over top. Top with remaining batter and then remaining topping.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Run a table knife around the edges to loosen. Invert carefully onto a cooling rack, then place brown sugar-cinnamon side up on a plate to serve.
