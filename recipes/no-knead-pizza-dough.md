## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 cup bread flour
- ½ cup rye flour
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt
- 1 cup water  (Optional)
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- ⅛ teaspoon active dry yeast
- 1 tablespoon water  (Optional)
- 1 ½ tablespoons cornmeal, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Combine bread flour, all-purpose flour, rye flour, and salt in a large bowl. Add water, olive oil, and yeast. Mix with a wooden spoon until a sticky, shaggy dough forms. Mix in 1 tablespoon water if dough appears very dry.
2. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let dough rise at room temperature until more than doubled, about 18 hours.
3. Scrape dough carefully onto a floured work surface. Divide dough into 2 pieces. Fold the left edge of one piece of dough into the center. Repeat with the top, right, and bottom edges. Turn dough over so the seam faces down; top should be relatively smooth and round. Repeat with the second piece of dough.
4. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Line a heavy-duty baking sheet with parchment paper. Sprinkle cornmeal across the top.
5. Gently flatten the balls of dough and stretch into rustic rounds or ovals. Top as desired.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes.
