## Ingredients

- ¼ cup sliced almonds
- 2  eggs
- ¾ cup white sugar
- ½ cup vegetable oil
- ¼ cup freshly squeezed lemon juice
- 1  lemon, zested
- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 packet Lievito Pane Degli Angeli (such as Paneangeli®)
- ⅓ cup powdered sugar
- 1 ½ teaspoons lemon juice

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 6-cup, 7-1/2x3-inch Bundt® pan. Sprinkle almonds evenly around the bottom of the pan. Set aside.
2. Beat eggs and sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl. Add oil, lemon juice, and lemon zest; mix until well combined. Gradually beat in flour until it has been incorporated. Add Lievito and mix well. Pour batter evenly into the prepared pan.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 28 to 30 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes. Run a knife down the sides of the pan to assist in releasing the cake from the pan. Place in the freezer for 20 minutes. Remove from the freezer and invert cake onto a serving platter.
4. Mix powdered sugar and lemon juice in a small bowl until glaze is smooth. Place glaze in a small resealable bag and snip the corner of the bag. Drizzle glaze over the top of the cake.
