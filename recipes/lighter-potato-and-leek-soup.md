## Ingredients

- 2  leeks, white parts only, thinly sliced
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 3 cloves garlic, smashed
- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 6 cups water
- 2 cubes  vegetable bouillon, or more to taste  (Optional)
- 1 teaspoon white sugar  (Optional)
- ½ teaspoon chili-garlic sauce
- cracked black pepper to taste
- 5  unpeeled potatoes, diced
- 1 cup low-fat milk

## Instructions

1. Combine leeks and 3 tablespoons olive oil in a stockpot over medium-low heat. Saute until soft, about 15 minutes, adding more oil if needed. Sprinkle flour over leeks and mash in with a wooden spoon. Reduce heat to low and cook for 2 minutes.
2. Slowly add 2 cups water, stirring constantly to create a roux. Slowly add 2 more cups water, stirring constantly. Stir in the remaining 2 cups water. Add bouillon cubes, sugar, chili-garlic sauce, and pepper. Increase heat to medium and stir occasionally until boiling.
3. Add potatoes and reduce heat to a low simmer. Cook until potatoes are soft, 45 to 60 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes or so and scraping the bottom of the pot as needed. Puree soup with an immersion blender until smooth with some chunks remaining. Stir in milk to thin and heat until warmed through.
