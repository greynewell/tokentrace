## Ingredients

- 2  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- 1 teaspoon seasoned salt
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 tablespoon butter
- ½ large onion, sliced
- ½  green bell pepper, sliced
- 2  fresh mushrooms, sliced
- 2  fresh hoagie rolls, split lengthwise
- 4 slices provolone cheese
- 2 teaspoons mayonnaise, or to taste
- 4 slices tomato, or to taste
- 4 leaves lettuce, shredded, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
2. Place chicken between 2 sheets of heavy plastic on a work surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/2 inch.
3. Cook chicken breasts on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 2 to 3 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove from the grill, shred meat, and season with seasoned salt.
4. Heat olive oil and butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion, bell pepper, and sliced mushrooms; cook and stir until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in shredded chicken and cook until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes.
5. Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a sheet pan with aluminum foil.
6. Place hoagie roll bottoms on the prepared pan. Set roll tops aside.
7. Spread 1/2 of the chicken mixture on each roll bottom, then place 2 slices provolone cheese side-by-side over top.
8. Broil until provolone is melted and hoagie rolls are crunchy, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the oven.
9. Divide tomato slices and lettuce between the two sandwiches. Spread mayonnaise on each roll top and close the sandwiches. Wrap each cheesesteak tightly with aluminum foil, using a knife to push any filling back inside. Let sit for 1 to 2 minutes for flavors to blend before serving.
