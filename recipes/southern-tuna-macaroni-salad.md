## Ingredients

- ½ cup diced red onion
- 1 (16 ounce) package elbow macaroni
- 1 cup mayonnaise
- ½ cup chopped pimento peppers
- 5 tablespoons dill pickle relish
- 2 tablespoons chow-chow (optional)
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- 1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 3 ribs celery, diced
- 2 large hard-boiled eggs, chopped
- 2 (6.5 ounce) jars tuna packed in oil

## Instructions

1. Place diced onion in a large bowl and cover with cold water. Let sit for 5 minutes. Drain into a colander.
2. While onion soaks, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain into the same colander as red onion and run under cold water to stop cooking and cool to room temperature.
3. Place mayonnaise, pimentos, relish, chow-chow, mustard, Cajun seasoning, and salt in a large bowl and stir to combine. Add pasta, red onion, and celery and stir to combine. Gently fold in tuna and eggs to combine.
