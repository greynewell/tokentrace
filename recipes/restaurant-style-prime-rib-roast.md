## Ingredients

- 1 (14 pound) roast-ready prime rib roast (ribs cut off and tied to roast)
- ¾ cup all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 2 teaspoons paprika
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ¼ teaspoon celery seed

## Instructions

1. Remove rib roast from the refrigerator. Allow it to come to room temperature for about 3 hours, depending on its size.
2. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a roasting pan with aluminum foil.
3. Place rib roast onto the prepared roasting pan; blot with paper towels. Sift together flour, pepper, salt, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, and celery seed into a bowl. Coat roast all over with flour mixture.
4. Roast in the preheated oven until cooked to your desired degree of doneness, about 4 1/2 hours (20 minutes a pound) for medium-rare. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 120 degrees F (49 degrees C) for medium-rare, 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for medium, or 140 degrees F (60 degrees C) for well-done.
5. Cover roast with aluminum foil. Let rest on the counter in a warm spot for 30 minutes to 1 hour before slicing.
