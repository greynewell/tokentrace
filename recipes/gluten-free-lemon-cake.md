## Ingredients

- 1 (19 ounce) can garbanzo beans, rinsed and drained
- ½ cup white sugar
- 4  eggs, separated
- 1  lemon, zested and juiced
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice concentrate
- 1 teaspoon orange extract
- 1 teaspoon gluten-free vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon gluten-free baking powder
- ½ cup white sugar
- 3 tablespoons margarine
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice concentrate
- ½  lemon, juiced

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan.
2. Blend garbanzo beans, sugar, egg yolks, lemon zest, 1/2 lemon juice, lemon juice concentrate, orange extract, and vanilla extract together in a food processor until smooth. Stir baking powder into bean mixture.
3. Whip egg whites together in a bowl using an electric mixer or a whisk until stiff. Fold bean mixture into egg whites. Gently pour batter into the prepared cake pan.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes. Let cool 20 minutes, then carefully run a knife along the bottom of the pan to release cake and turn onto a wire rack to cool completely.
5. While cake finishes cooling, heat sugar, margarine, lemon juice concentrate, and lemon juice in a saucepan over medium heat until fully combined, about 2 minutes. Drizzle glaze over cooled cake.
