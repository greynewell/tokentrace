## Ingredients

- ½ cup unsalted butter
- 20  mushrooms, stems removed
- ½ (8 ounce) package shredded Monterey Jack cheese
- ¼ teaspoon garlic powder
- ⅛ teaspoon dried thyme
- ¼ cup dry white wine
- 2 teaspoons soy sauce
- ½ cup seasoned dry bread crumbs

## Instructions

1. Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
2. Place butter in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat in the microwave until melted, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Dip the bottom of each mushroom cap in melted butter and place on a rimmed baking sheet.
3. Stir Monterey Jack cheese, garlic powder, and thyme into the remaining melted butter. Stir in wine and soy sauce. Add enough bread crumbs to make a wet and sticky mixture.
4. Spoon bread crumb mixture into each mushroom cap, mounding it slightly to use up all the filling.
5. Broil in the preheated oven until brown and bubbly, 3 to 4 minutes. Cool slightly before serving, about 5 minutes.
