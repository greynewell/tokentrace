## Ingredients

- 2  Roma tomatoes
- 4  guajillo chile peppers, stemmed and seeded
- ⅓ large onion
- 1 stalk celery
- 1  carrot, peeled
- 1 clove garlic
- 1 cup chicken stock
- 2 tablespoons chicken bouillon granules
- 2 pounds chicken breasts
- 3  bay leaves

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Place tomatoes, 2 guajillo peppers, onion, celery, carrot, and garlic into a large pot and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until vegetables are tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain.
3. Blend vegetable mixture, chicken stock, remaining guajillo peppers, and chicken bouillon together in a blender or food processor until sauce is smooth.
4. Place chicken in a baking dish and pour sauce over and around chicken to cover completely. Top with bay leaves.
5. Bake in the preheated oven, stirring sauce every 20 minutes, until chicken is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 60 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
