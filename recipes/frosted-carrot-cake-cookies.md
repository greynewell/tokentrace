## Ingredients

- 1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ cup unsalted butter, softened
- ⅓ cup white sugar
- 2 tablespoons packed brown sugar
- 1 large egg
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 cup shredded carrot
- ½ cup raisins
- ⅓ cup chopped walnuts
- ¼ cup crushed pineapple  (Optional)
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- ¼ cup honey

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 baking sheets.
2. Whisk flour, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl.
3. Beat butter, white sugar, and brown sugar together in another bowl until creamy. Add egg and vanilla extract; continue mixing until pale and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Mix in carrots, raisins, walnuts, and pineapple at low speed. Add flour mixture; beat until just combined.
4. Drop 1 1/2 tablespoons of batter at a time onto the prepared baking sheets, 2 inches apart.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned and springy to the touch, 12 to 16 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool on the sheets for 5 minutes before transferring to wire racks to cool completely, about 30 minutes more.
6. Blend cream cheese and honey together in a food processor or with an electric mixer until smooth. Sandwich flat sides of cooled cookies together with a generous tablespoon of cream cheese filling in between.
