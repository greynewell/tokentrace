## Ingredients

- ⅔ cup uncooked orzo pasta
- ¼ cup mayonnaise
- ¼ cup sour cream
- 1 tablespoon cider vinegar
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- 1 tablespoon yellow mustard
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives
- ½ teaspoon white sugar
- ½ teaspoon black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1 ½ cups chopped fully cooked ham
- 1 cup diced red onion
- ½ cup chopped green bell pepper
- ½ cup halved cherry or grape tomatoes

## Instructions

1. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the orzo, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water in a colander set in the sink.
2. Whisk together the mayonnaise, sour cream, cider vinegar, Dijon and yellow mustard, chives, sugar, black pepper, and salt in a bowl.
3. Place the cooked and cooled pasta, ham, red onion, green pepper, and tomatoes in a large bowl. Toss together with the dressing. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes before serving.
