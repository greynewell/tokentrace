## Ingredients

- ¼ cup light sour cream
- ¼ cup reduced fat blue cheese crumbles
- ¼ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1 ½ pounds ground chicken
- ¼ cup hot pepper sauce
- ½ teaspoon celery salt  (Optional)
- ¼ teaspoon poultry seasoning
- ½ teaspoon paprika
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
- 1 tablespoon hot pepper sauce
- 4  Kaiser rolls, split
- 4 leaves iceberg lettuce
- ½ cup diced celery

## Instructions

1. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Stir the sour cream, blue cheese, and Worcestershire sauce together in a small bowl; set aside.
2. Mix the ground chicken, 1/4 cup hot sauce, celery salt, poultry seasoning, paprika, and cayenne pepper together in a mixing bowl until evenly blended. Form into four 3/4-inch-thick patties.
3. Cook the chicken burgers on the preheated grill 6 to 7 minutes until well marked. Spray the uncooked top of the burger with cooking spray, and flip the burgers over. Brush the cooked side with 1 tablespoon hot sauce, and continue cooking until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 5 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
4. To assemble the burgers, place a lettuce leaf on each roll bottom. Top with a burger patty, then spoon on 2 tablespoons of blue cheese sauce, and 2 tablespoons celery. Place the top of the roll on top to finish the sandwich.
