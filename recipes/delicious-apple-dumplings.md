## Ingredients

- ¾ cup butter
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle caffeinated citrus-flavored soda (such as Mountain Dew®)
- 4 small Granny Smith apple, peeled, cored, and quartered
- 2 (8 ounce) packages refrigerated crescent roll dough

## Instructions

1. Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan.
2. Heat the butter, sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla in a saucepan over medium heat until the sugar dissolves, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat; set aside. Divide the crescent roll dough into 16 triangles. Roll 1 slice of apple with the dough and arrange on the prepared pan.
