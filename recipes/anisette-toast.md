## Ingredients

- 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon baking soda
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ cup softened butter
- 1 cup white sugar
- 3  eggs
- 4 teaspoons anise extract

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl; set aside. Grease 2 baking sheets.
2. Beat butter and sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until fluffy. Beat in one egg until completely incorporated, then another. Beat in last egg along with the anise extract. Mix in flour until just incorporated. Divide dough into two 12-inch long logs, 1/2-inch thick; place on prepared baking sheets.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until golden and firm to the touch, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the oven, and allow to cool, 5 minutes.
4. Cut into 3/4-inch thick slices using a serrated knife, and place cut-side-down onto the baking sheets.
5. Bake 5 to 10 minutes until the bottoms turn golden brown. Turn cookies over, and continue baking until golden brown on the other side, 5 to 10 minutes more. Cool completely on a wire rack before serving.
