## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ cup butter
- 1 cup brown sugar
- 2  large eggs
- 3 medium bananas
- 1 tablespoon rum extract
- 1 cup shredded coconut
- ½ cup chopped dried pineapple

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare 12 muffin cups with paper liners.
2. Sift the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt into a bowl; set aside. In a large bowl, cream together butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition, then beat in the bananas and rum extract. Stir in the flour mixture. Fold in the shredded coconut and pineapple; mixing just enough to evenly distribute. Evenly divide the batter among the prepared muffin cups.
3. Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.
