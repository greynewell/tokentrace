## Ingredients

- 1  egg, beaten
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons milk
- 1 cup sifted all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon baking powder  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Combine egg, milk, and salt in a bowl. Add sifted flour and stir until a dough forms, adding more flour as needed, a little at a time, for the dough to come together. Separate into two balls.
2. Sprinkle a work surface with flour and roll out each piece of dough as thin as you like. Let rolled dough rest for 20 minutes.
3. Cut into strips and spread to dry, dusting with a bit of flour so the noodles don't stick together. Let dry for approximately 2 hours.
4. Cook noodles in boiling salted water, or hot soup, until tender, about 10 minutes.
