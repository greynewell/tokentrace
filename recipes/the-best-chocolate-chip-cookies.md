## Ingredients

- 2 cups butter flavored shortening
- 1 ½ cups packed brown sugar
- 1 ½ cups white sugar
- 4  eggs
- 4 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 4 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
- 1 cup flaked coconut
- 1 cup chopped macadamia nuts

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. In a large bowl, cream together the butter flavored shortening, brown sugar and white sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt; stir into the creamed mixture. Finally, fold in the chocolate chips, coconut and macadamia nuts. Roll dough into 1 inch balls and place them 2 inches apart onto ungreased cookie sheets.
3. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy! - they will be chewy. If you like them crispy, increase the cooking time to about 12 minutes. (My mom loves them burnt!)
