## Ingredients

- ¾ cup small-curd cottage cheese
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill
- 1 tablespoon minced onion
- 3  eggs
- 1 ¾ cups gluten-free baking flour (such as Gluten Free Mama almond or coconut blend)
- ¼ teaspoon xanthan gum
- 1 ¼ cups milk
- 2 tablespoons butter, melted
- 1 teaspoon salt
- cooking spray

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
2. Mix cottage cheese, dill, and onion together in a small bowl.
3. Set aside.
4. Add eggs, flour, xanthan gum, milk, and butter, in that order, to a blender.
5. Blend for 15 to 20 seconds.
6. Scrape down the sides of the blender to incorporate any dry ingredients.
7. Add cottage cheese mixture.
8. Gently pulse just enough to blend in.
9. Scrape down with a rubber spatula to make sure all ingredients are evenly incorporated.
10. Generously spray a popover pan with cooking spray.
11. Fill each cup about 3/4 full of batter.
12. Bake in the preheated oven for 32 to 35 minutes.
13. Do not open the oven while baking.
14. Use the cooking light if you need to check on the popovers; opening the oven will make the popovers deflate and get soggy.
15. Quickly pierce the side of each popover with a sharp knife.
16. Remove from the pan and place on a cooling rack.
17. Serve warm.
