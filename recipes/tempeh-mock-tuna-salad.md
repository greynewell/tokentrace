## Ingredients

- 2 cups vegetable broth
- 1 (8 ounce) package tempeh
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon seaweed flakes or granules
- ½ cup minced red onion
- 1 cup chopped celery
- 1 cup chopped dill pickles
- ¼ cup soy mayonnaise

## Instructions

1. Heat the broth to a light boil over medium-high heat. Add the tempeh to the broth, and simmer for 25 minutes. Drain and let cool to room temperature for 15 minutes. Once cooled, grate tempeh into a large bowl.
