## Ingredients

- 3 (12 ounce) packages refrigerated biscuit dough
- 1 cup white sugar
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- ½ cup margarine
- 1 cup packed brown sugar
- ½ cup chopped walnuts  (Optional)
- ½ cup raisins

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease one 9- or 10-inch tube or Bundt® pan.
2. Mix white sugar and cinnamon in a plastic bag. Cut biscuits into quarters. Shake 6 to 8 biscuit pieces in the sugar-cinnamon mix.
3. Arrange pieces in the bottom of the prepared pan. Continue until all biscuits are coated and placed in the pan. If using walnuts and raisins, arrange in and among the biscuit pieces as you go along.
4. Melt margarine with the brown sugar in a small saucepan over medium heat. Boil for 1 minute. Pour over the biscuits.
5. Bake in the preheated oven for 35 minutes. Let bread cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a plate. Do not cut! The bread just pulls apart.
