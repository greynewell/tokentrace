## Ingredients

- 2 pounds chicken wings
- 2 tablespoons seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®)
- ¼ teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper
- ½ cup cornstarch
- 4 tablespoons butter
- 1 teaspoon seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®)

## Instructions

1. Preheat the air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Place chicken wings in a large bowl and toss with 2 tablespoons Old Bay® seasoning and black pepper. Add cornstarch and toss wings until fully coated. Shake each wing and place in the air fryer basket, making sure they are not touching; cook in batches if necessary.
