## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1 ½ cups fresh black raspberries
- 1 ½  lemons, zested
- 2 large eggs
- 1 cup milk
- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1  lemon, juiced
- ½ cup white sugar
- 1  lemon, juiced

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
2. Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Stir in black raspberries and lemon zest.
3. Beat eggs in a separate bowl using a fork or whisk. Pour in milk, oil, and lemon juice; mix well. Stir in flour mixture until just moistened. Pour into the prepared loaf pan.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour.
