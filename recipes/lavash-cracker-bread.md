## Ingredients

- 1 cup lukewarm water
- ¼ cup whole wheat flour
- 1 (.25 ounce) envelope active dry yeast
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 3 cups all-purpose flour

## Instructions

1. Stir water, flour, and yeast together in the bowl of a stand mixer until moistened. Mix in 1 cup flour and salt. Gradually mix in remaining 2 cups flour with a dough hook attachment until dough comes together.
2. Knead dough until elastic, 8 to 10 minutes. Add more flour or water, if needed, to keep dough from getting sticky or too stiff. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
3. Punch down dough and roll into a long log; cut into 30 small walnut-sized pieces. Roll each piece into a ball. Cover with a damp kitchen towel and let rest for 30 minutes.
4. Place an ungreased baking sheet on the center rack of the oven; preheat to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).
5. Roll each ball into a circle about 8 inches in diameter; dough should be paper thin and almost translucent. (If dough is too thick, it will bubble up like pita bread.)
6. Pull out the oven shelf and place as many crackers onto the hot baking sheet as possible. Close the oven and bake until lightly browned on top with small bubbles, about 3 minutes.
7. Remove crackers from the oven and transfer to a wire rack to cool.
8. Repeat Steps 5 to 7 to bake remaining batches, adjusting dough thickness as necessary.
