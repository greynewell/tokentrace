## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon ghee
- 4 cups grated dried coconut
- ¾ cup brown sugar
- ¾ cup white sugar
- ¼ cup water, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Melt 1 tablespoon of ghee to a pan over low heat; add coconut and roast until lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Set aside.
2. Add brown sugar to a skillet over medium heat and slowly mix in sugar. Put in a glug of water, increase heat, and bring to a boil, about 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Lower the heat, stirring constantly until the mixture starts to solidify, about 2 minutes. Add coconut and mix in until well combined.
3. Transfer mixture to a greased sheet pan or baking dish and spread out. Cut immediately into squares or rectangles and allow to cool completely.
4. Take the coconut you put aside earlier and add it to the mixture, mix well so the coconut is evenly spread throughout the sugar
5. Pour the mixture into a pan and allow to firm up. Cut into pieces. Serve and enjoy.
