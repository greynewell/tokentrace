## Ingredients

- 4 tablespoons butter, softened
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 (8 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, pounded to 1/4-inch thickness
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 2 sheets plastic wrap
- ½ cup all-purpose flour
- 1  egg, beaten
- 1 cup panko bread crumbs
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- nonstick cooking spray

## Instructions

1. Mix butter, parsley, garlic, and salt together in a bowl until evenly combined. Divide herbed butter in half and place on a baking sheet. Freeze for 10 minutes.
2. Place chicken on a clean work surface and season with salt and pepper. Place 1/2 of the herbed butter in the center of each pounded chicken breast. Gather the sides of the chicken up around the butter mixture. Cover each ball of chicken in plastic wrap and twist to secure. Place back on the baking sheet and freeze for 30 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
4. Place flour in a bowl, beaten egg in a second bowl, and panko and paprika in a third bowl. Remove plastic from chicken. Dredge each chicken breast first in flour, then in beaten egg, and finally in panko bread crumb mixture.
5. Place breaded chicken in the basket of the air fryer. Spray the tops with cooking spray.
6. Air fry for 5 minutes. Spray with nonstick spray again and cook for 5 minutes more. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest for 5 minutes.
