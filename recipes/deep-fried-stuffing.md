## Ingredients

- ½ cup all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon poultry seasoning
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 2  eggs
- 2 tablespoons milk
- 1 cup seasoned bread crumbs
- ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 2 ½ cups prepared stuffing
- 1 quart oil for frying, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Combine flour, poultry seasoning, salt, and black pepper in a shallow bowl. Beat eggs and milk together in a second shallow bowl until smooth. Mix bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, and 1 teaspoon black pepper together in a third shallow bowl.
2. Scoop stuffing, about 2 tablespoons per serving, and roll into a ball using your hands, forming about 12 balls. Dredge each ball through flour mixture, shaking off any excess. Transfer each ball to egg mixture and evenly coat. Roll each ball in the bread crumb mixture until evenly coated. Set stuffing balls on a plate; set aside to allow coating to stick.
3. Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
4. Carefully lower 4 to 5 stuffing balls into hot oil and fry until golden brown on all sides, about 4 minutes; transfer to a paper towel-lined plate using a slotted spoon. Repeat with remaining stuffing balls.
