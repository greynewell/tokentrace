## Ingredients

- 1 ½ tablespoons shortening
- 2 cups self-rising flour
- 1 cup milk
- 2 pinches garlic salt

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a well-seasoned cast iron skillet with the shortening, and place it in the oven as it heats.
2. Whisk together flour and milk in a bowl, making a thick but still runny batter.
3. Remove the hot greased skillet from the preheated oven, and quickly sprinkle a pinch of garlic salt over the bottom of the skillet. Immediately pour in the batter, and sprinkle the top with a pinch of garlic salt.
4. Return the skillet to the preheated oven and bake until cake is risen and the top is golden brown, about 20 minutes.
