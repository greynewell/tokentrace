## Ingredients

- 2 cups white sugar
- 1 ½ cups unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 6  eggs, at room temperature, separated
- 1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract
- 3 ½ cups unbleached all-purpose flour
- 4 ½ teaspoons baking powder
- 2 pinches salt, divided
- 1 ½ cups whole milk, at room temperature
- ½ cup chocolate-flavored milk powder (such as Nesquik®)
- ½ cup strawberry-flavored milk powder (such as Nesquik®)
- 9 drops red food coloring, or as desired
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, at room temperature
- ½ cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
- ½ cup shortening
- 1 (16 ounce) package confectioners' sugar

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour three 9-inch round cake pans.
2. Combine sugar and butter in a bowl and cream using an electric mixer until light and fluffy, scraping down the sides and blending for a total of 5 minutes. Add egg yolks slowly, 1 at a time, beating into creamed butter mixture. Beat in vanilla extract.
3. Sift flour, baking powder, and 1 pinch salt together in a separate bowl. Add to creamed sugar mixture in 3 batches, alternating with milk and blending after each addition. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl and blend for 1 minute more; batter should be smooth and consistent. Separate batter evenly into 3 mixing bowls, about 2 1/2 cups in each.
4. Beat egg whites and remaining salt together in a bowl using a whip attachment until stiff peaks form.
5. Fold 1/3 of the whipped egg whites into 1 bowl of batter and pour into a prepared cake pan for the vanilla layer.
6. Fold 1/3 of the whipped egg whites and chocolate-flavored milk powder into another bowl of batter. Pour into another prepared cake pan for the chocolate layer.
7. Fold remaining 1/3 of the whipped egg whites, strawberry-flavored milk powder, and red food coloring into remaining bowl of batter. Pour into the remaining prepared cake pan for the strawberry layer.
8. Bake cake layers in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of each comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool for about 15 minutes before flipping layers onto a wire rack to cool to room temperature, 20 to 30 minutes more.
9. Combine cream cheese, butter, and shortening in a bowl and cream together until smooth. Scrape down the bowl and add confectioners' sugar. Blend until frosting is smooth.
10. Assemble and frost the cooled cake layers and decorate as you please.
