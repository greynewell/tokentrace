## Ingredients

- oil for deep frying
- 1 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- ¼ teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon paprika
- 1  egg
- 1 cup milk
- 3  skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into 1/2-inch strips
- ¼ cup hot pepper sauce
- 1 tablespoon butter

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Combine flour, salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika, and garlic powder in a large bowl. Whisk together egg and milk in a small bowl.
3. Dip each piece of chicken in egg mixture, then roll in flour mixture. Repeat so that each piece of chicken is double-coated. Refrigerate breaded chicken for 20 minutes.
4. Fry chicken in hot oil in batches. Cook until golden brown and juices run clear, 5 to 6 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
5. Combine hot sauce and butter in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat sauce in the microwave until melted, 20 to 30 seconds. Pour sauce over fried chicken; mix to coat.
