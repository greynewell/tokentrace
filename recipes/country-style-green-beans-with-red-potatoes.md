## Ingredients

- ½ pound smoked turkey tails
- 2 (14.5 ounce) cans green beans, drained and rinsed
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 10 small red potatoes, peeled and cubed
- 1 tablespoon seasoned salt
- 2 teaspoons ground black pepper
- 1 tablespoon garlic powder

## Instructions

1. Place turkey tails and onion in a 4-quart Dutch oven and fill half way with water. Season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Bring to a boil, then cover and simmer over low heat until meat falls off the bones, about 2 hours. Remove and discard bones and skin; return meat to the pot.
