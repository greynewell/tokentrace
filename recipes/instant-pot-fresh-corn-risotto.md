## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons butter, divided
- 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, divided
- 2 ears fresh corn, kernels cut from cob
- ½ cup finely chopped red onion
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 ½ cups Arborio rice
- ½ cup white wine
- 4 cups chicken broth
- ½ cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese

## Instructions

1. Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and select Saute function. Add 1 tablespoon butter and 1 tablespoon olive oil; stir until butter melts. Add corn kernels and cook, stirring occasionally, about 2 minutes. Remove corn to a bowl and set aside.
