## Ingredients

- 1 ¼ cups quick cooking oats
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- ⅓ cup white sugar
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup milk
- 1  egg
- ¼ cup vegetable oil
- 1 cup blueberries, rinsed and drained

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin or line cups with paper liners.
2. Whisk milk, oil, and egg together in a bowl until evenly blended. Stir oats, flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a separate bowl, making a well in the center. Pour milk mixture into well and stir just until batter is combined; fold in blueberries.
