## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 4  boneless pork chops
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon vinegar
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch
- ½ cup pineapple juice

## Instructions

1. Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat, and brown the pork chops about 5 minutes on each side. Remove chops from the skillet, and set aside.
2. Mix the chicken broth, soy sauce and vinegar into the skillet, and bring to a boil. Return the pork chops to the skillet, reduce heat, and simmer 20 minutes.
