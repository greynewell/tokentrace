## Ingredients

- 4 ounces cream cheese, softened
- 4 teaspoons dried dill weed, divided
- 4 tablespoons minced garlic, divided
- 2 tablespoons butter, softened
- 2  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- 1 small tomato, diced

- 4 thick slices French bread

## Instructions

1. In a medium bowl, mix together the cream cheese, 2 teaspoons of dill, and 2 tablespoons of garlic. Set aside.
2. Melt about half of the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Season chicken breast halves with remaining garlic and dill. Cook for about 8 minutes per side, or until the meat is firm and juices run clear. Remove from the pan, and set aside.
