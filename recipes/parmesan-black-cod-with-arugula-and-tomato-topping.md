## Ingredients

- 2 cups chopped vine-ripened tomatoes
- ¼ cup chopped fresh basil
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 tablespoons Pinot Gris
- 2 tablespoons minced red onion
- ½ teaspoon minced garlic
- ¼ teaspoon salt  (Optional)
- 1 pinch ground black pepper to taste
- cooking spray
- 1 pound black cod fillets
- 4 teaspoons Dijon mustard
- 4 teaspoons butter, melted
- 1 bunch arugula
- ¾ cup shredded Parmesan cheese

## Instructions

1. Combine tomatoes, basil, olive oil, Pinot Gris, onion, garlic, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl; refrigerate until flavors blend, about 30 minutes.
2. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a rimmed baking sheet with cooking spray.
3. Place black cod, skin-side down, on the prepared baking sheet. Mix Dijon mustard and butter together in a small bowl.
4. Bake in the preheated oven for 5 minutes. Flip fish and brush mustard-butter over fish, coating the surface completely. Continue baking fish until it flakes easily with a fork, 5 to 6 minutes. Cut fish into 4 pieces.
