## Ingredients

- 12  small jalapeno or habanero peppers
- 6 ounces Monterey Jack cheese, cubed
- 1 cup thinly sliced hard salami
- wooden toothpicks

## Instructions

1. Slice off the stem ends of the jalapeno peppers, and carefully remove the seeds and white fibers with a small knife.
2. Fill the pepper with cheese.
3. Take one piece of salami, and cover the open end of the pepper with it.
4. Fold it around, and secure with three toothpicks in a row (like the legs of an insect).
5. The salami should keep the cheese from leaking out when grilling.
6. Preheat on outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate.
7. Place the peppers legs side up on the hot grill.
8. Turn occasionally after a minute or two as the meat begins to crisp up, and the skin on the peppers is starting to blister.
9. When it is evenly browned the toothpicks will have turned black like six little legs sticking out - hence the name cucarachas.
10. Allow the peppers to cool slightly, then remove toothpicks and enjoy!
