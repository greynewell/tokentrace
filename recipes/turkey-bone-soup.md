## Ingredients

- 1  turkey carcass, cooked
- 4 (14 ounce) cans low-sodium chicken broth
- 1  onion, quartered
- 1 stalk celery, cut into 2 inch pieces
- 4 cloves garlic, crushed
- 2 cups chopped cooked turkey breast
- 1 (16 ounce) package frozen mixed vegetables
- 1 cup uncooked white rice
- 1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans, rinsed and drained
- salt and pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon dried oregano
- 1 tablespoon dried basil
- 1 teaspoon paprika

## Instructions

1. Place turkey carcass in a large stockpot with a lid. Pour chicken broth over turkey to mostly cover. Drop in onion, celery, and garlic. Bring to a boil over medium heat, cover, and simmer 2 hours, turning carcass occasionally.
2. Remove carcass from stock and set aside to cool. Remove onion, celery, and garlic from stock and drop them into a blender along with about 1/2 cup of stock, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the vegetable mixture moving before leaving it on to purée. Pour puréed onion, celery, and garlic back into stock.
3. Remove as much cooked turkey meat from carcass as possible and add meat to stock. Stir in chopped turkey breast, frozen mixed vegetables, rice, kidney beans, salt, pepper, oregano, basil, and paprika. Bring soup to a boil, cover, and simmer until rice is tender, 20 to 30 minutes.
