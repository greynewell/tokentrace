## Ingredients

- 1 pound ground beef
- ¼ cup chopped onion
- ¼ cup sour cream
- ½ cup ketchup
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 (12 ounce) can refrigerated flaky biscuit dough
- 2 tablespoons butter, melted

## Instructions

1. Cook and stir the ground beef and onion in a skillet over medium heat, breaking the meat up into crumbles as it cooks, until the meat is well browned, about 10 minutes.
2. Drain the fat from the beef in a colander.
3. Return beef to skillet, and stir in sour cream, ketchup, salt, and garlic powder.
4. Bring the mixture to a simmer, reduce heat, and simmer while you make the pockets.
5. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
6. Unroll the biscuits on a floured work surface, and lightly roll each biscuit out to a square about 4 inches on a side.
7. Arrange the squares on a baking sheet.
8. Spoon 2 to 3 tablespoons of the beef mixture into the center of each square, and fold a corner over to meet its opposite corner, making a triangle.
9. Seal the edges with a fork, and cut three small slits into the top of each pocket.
10. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.
11. Brush each pocket with melted butter.
