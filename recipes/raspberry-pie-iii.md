## Ingredients

- 1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie
- 4 cups raspberries
- 1 cup white sugar
- 2 ½ tablespoons tapioca
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- ¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ⅛ teaspoon salt
- 4 teaspoons butter
- 1 tablespoon half-and-half cream

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line the bottom and sides of a 9-inch pie plate with one pie crust.
2. Mix raspberries, sugar, tapioca, lemon juice, cinnamon, and salt together in a large bowl until raspberries are well coated; pour into pie crust and dot with butter.
3. Cover filling with remaining pie crust; flute edges to seal. Brush cream on top, then cut several slits to allow steam to escape.
4. Bake pie in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce the heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) and bake until crust is golden and filling is bubbly, about 30 to 35 minutes more. Allow pie to cool completely before serving.
