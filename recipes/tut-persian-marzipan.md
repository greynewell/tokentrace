## Ingredients

- 1 cup blanched almond flour
- ½ cup powdered sugar, or more to taste
- ½ teaspoon ground cardamom
- 2 tablespoons rose water, or more as needed
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 2 tablespoons raw pistachios

## Instructions

1. Combine almond flour, powdered sugar, and cardamom in a medium bowl. Drizzle in rose water, 1 tablespoon at a time, and gently knead until a soft dough forms that doesn't stick to your hands. Taste and add more powdered sugar to reach desired sweetness. Adjust rose water if needed.
2. Pinch off about 1/2 teaspoon of dough. Form into a ball and shape like a cone, to resemble a mulberry, or any shape that you like. Roll in white sugar. Repeat with remaining dough.
3. Chop pistachios into slivers, resembling stems. Place a pistachio sliver over each piece of "tut."
