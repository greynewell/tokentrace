## Ingredients

- ¼ teaspoon poultry seasoning
- ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste
- ⅛ teaspoon ground white pepper
- ⅛ teaspoon onion powder
- 1 tablespoon garlic powder
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 cup heavy cream
- ½ cup milk
- 1 pound linguine pasta
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- ½ cup white wine
- 4  skinless, boneless chicken breasts
- 8 ounces shrimp
- 3 tablespoons grated Romano cheese

## Instructions

1. Mix together garlic powder, poultry seasoning, cayenne pepper, white pepper, and onion powder in a small bowl. Divide spice mixture in half.
2. Melt butter over low heat in a small skillet. Slowly stir in cream, milk, and 1/2 of the spice mixture. Continue cooking over low heat, stirring frequently, until slightly reduced and thickened to desired sauce consistency. Remove from heat and set aside.
3. Preheat a grill to high heat.
4. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook pasta in boiling water until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside.
5. Heat olive oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Carefully stir in wine and remaining spice mixture. Place chicken breasts in the skillet and cook until no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, 16 to 20 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.
6. Lightly oil grill grate. Cook shrimp on the preheated grill until slightly opaque, 3 to 4 minutes.
7. Serve each chicken breast on a bed of linguine topped with grilled shrimp. Ladle generously with cream sauce. Garnish with Romano cheese.
