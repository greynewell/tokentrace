## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups buttermilk
- ½ cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
- ½ cup margarine
- ¼ cup white sugar
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- 2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 5 ½ cups bread flour

## Instructions

1. Proof yeast in warm water.
2. Place the butter or margarine and buttermilk in a small saucepan. Heat slowly until butter or margarine has melted. Cool to lukewarm.
3. Place sugar, salt, baking soda, buttermilk mixture, and yeast in large mixing bowl. Add 3 cups flour one cup at a time, and mix with the dough hook attachment of an electric mixer. Gradually add the remaining flour while continuing to mix. When dough is not sticky, turn out on a lightly floured surface. Knead for several minutes, until the dough is soft and smooth. Place in a greased bowl, and turn once. Allow to rise until doubled in size.
4. Punch down the dough. Divide, and shape into 2 loaves. Place in two well greased 8 x 4 inch bread pans. Allow to rise until dough has risen one inch above pans.
5. Bake in a preheated 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) oven for 30 to 35 minutes. Loaves are done when nicely brown and hollow sounding when thumped.
