## Ingredients

- ¾ cup lukewarm milk
- 5 tablespoons lukewarm water
- 3 tablespoons butter, softened
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt
- 3 tablespoons white sugar
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- 3 tablespoons dried minced onion
- ¼ cup instant potato flakes
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 (.25 ounce) envelope active dry yeast
- 1  egg white
- 1 tablespoon water
- ¼ cup dried minced onion

## Instructions

1. Place the milk, water, butter, salt, sugar, onion powder, 3 tablespoons of dried onion, potato flakes, flour and yeast into the pan of a bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Select the Dough cycle, and press Start.
2. When the cycle has completed, remove the dough from the machine, and knead on a lightly floured surface. Cut into 8 equal pieces, and form into balls. Gently flatten the balls until they are 4 inches in diameter. If they keep shrinking back, just let them relax for a minute before flattening. Place on a baking sheet, and cover loosely with a towel. Set in a draft-free place to rise until doubled in size, about 40 minutes.
3. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Whisk together the egg white and water in a cup. Brush over the tops of the risen rolls, and sprinkle with remaining minced onion.
4. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown. Cool completely, then slice in half horizontally before using.
