## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon grated orange zest
- 5 ½ tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into chunks
- ½ cup sweetened dried cranberries
- ⅓ cup chopped walnuts
- ½ cup heavy cream
- 1 large egg, beaten
- 2 tablespoons heavy cream
- ½ cup confectioners' sugar
- 2 teaspoons orange juice
- 3 drops orange extract

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a heavy baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl. Stir in grated orange zest. Cut in cold butter with 2 knives or a pastry blender until butter is the size of small peas. Mix in cranberries and walnuts.
3. Mix 1/2 cup cream and egg in a small bowl until well combined. Add to the flour mixture and stir with a spoon or by hand until just combined and dough comes together. Divide dough in half and form into two 3/4-inch thick circles. Cut each circle in half, and cut each half into 3 triangular-shaped scones. Place scones on the prepared baking sheet and brush with remaining 2 tablespoons heavy cream.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until the edges begin to brown slightly, 13 to 15 minutes.
5. Meanwhile, mix confectioners' sugar, orange juice, and orange extract together in a small bowl until completely combined. Drizzle glaze over scones and serve warm.
