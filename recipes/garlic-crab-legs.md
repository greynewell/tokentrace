## Ingredients

- 3 ½ pounds Alaskan king crab legs with shell
- 6 ears fresh corn
- 1 ½ cups butter
- 3 teaspoons minced garlic
- ⅛ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
- 1 teaspoon Old Bay Seasoning TM, or to taste

## Instructions

1. In a very large stock pot, bring a large amount of water to a boil. Place crab legs and corn in the pot of boiling water. Boil until corn is tender and crab legs are opaque and flaky. Crab may finish cooking before corn; check every 5 minutes to see if they are finished cooking. Drain well. Cut a slit into each crab leg shell to make it easier for your guests.
2. In a large saucepan, melt butter, garlic, red pepper flakes, and Old Bay seasoning. Stir in crab and corn and sauté for 5 to 10 minutes.
