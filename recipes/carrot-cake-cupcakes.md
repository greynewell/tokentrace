## Ingredients

- 1 ½ sticks unsalted butter, softened
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon ground allspice
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 2 large eggs
- ½ teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- 1 cup grated carrots
- ½ cup chopped toasted pecans
- 4 ounces cream cheese
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
- ⅜ cup white sugar
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- 1 pinch ground cinnamon

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 15 cupcake cups with paper liners.
2. Beat 1 1/2 sticks of butter with an electric mixer in a large bowl until creamy. Beat in sugar.
3. Combine flour, baking soda, cinnamon, allspice, and salt in a medium bowl or on a piece of parchment paper; mix well. Add to the butter mixture, alternating with eggs, beating well after the addition of each. Add vanilla extract and mix. Add carrots and beat on medium speed until well incorporated. Fold in pecans.
4. Scoop batter evenly into the prepared cupcake cups.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until set and a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean, 20 to 22 minutes. Remove from the oven and let rest for 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
6. Beat cream cheese and butter for frosting together in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Add sugar gradually, beating constantly. Mix in vanilla extract and cinnamon. Frost cooled cupcakes.
