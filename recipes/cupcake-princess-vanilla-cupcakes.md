## Ingredients

- 1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
- ¾ teaspoon baking soda
- 1 pinch salt
- 5 tablespoons butter, cut into pieces
- ⅔ cup milk
- 1 cup white sugar
- 2  eggs
- 1  egg yolk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

1. Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a standard muffin tin with 12 paper cupcake liners. Combine flour, baking soda, and salt in a bowl; set aside.
