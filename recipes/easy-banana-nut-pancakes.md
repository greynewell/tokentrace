## Ingredients

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- ¼ cup finely chopped walnuts
- 3 tablespoons white sugar
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup almond milk
- 2 small overripe bananas, mashed
- 1 ½ tablespoons butter, melted
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1  egg

## Instructions

1. Mix flour, walnuts, sugar, baking powder, nutmeg, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl; make a well in the center.
2. Whisk almond milk, bananas, melted butter, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl until smooth. Whisk in egg. Pour mixture into the well in the flour mixture; stir until just combined.
3. Heat a lightly oiled skillet over medium-high heat. Drop 1/4 cup batter into the skillet; tilt gently to spread batter evenly. Cook until bubbles form and the edges are firm, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 1 to 2 minutes more. Repeat with remaining batter.
