## Ingredients

- ¾ cup brown sugar
- ½ cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
- ½ cup white sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 large egg
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- ¾ teaspoon baking soda
- 1 cup milk chocolate chips
- 1 (3 ounce) bar dark chocolate, cut into chunks
- 3 tablespoons white chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. Combine brown sugar, butter, white sugar, and salt in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until a creamy, deep brown mixture forms. Add egg and vanilla; beat until mixture lightens and becomes smooth, 10 to 15 seconds.
2. Mix flour and baking soda together in a separate bowl. Add slowly to the wet ingredients until mostly incorporated, but some white traces of flour remain. Fold in milk chocolate, dark chocolate, and white chocolate using a spatula, not the mixer. Cover the dough and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 48 hours.
3. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) when ready to bake.
4. Divide cold dough into 2 1/4-ounce portions and place on a cookie sheet.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until the edges start to look golden brown and crispy, 10 to 12 minutes. Do not overbake; the centers will not look fully done. Cool until cookies are set, about 30 minutes.
