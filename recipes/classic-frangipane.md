## Ingredients

- 1 cup skim milk
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1 large egg yolk
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
- ½ cup white sugar
- ½ cup almond meal
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, or to taste
- ¼ teaspoon almond extract, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Bring milk to a boil in a saucepan. Remove from the heat and set aside.
2. Beat 1/4 cup sugar, egg, and egg yolk together until foamy. Add flour and slowly pour in hot milk, beating constantly until smooth and no lumps remain.
3. Pour the mixture back into the saucepan and slowly bring to a simmer over low heat. Cook, beating constantly to avoid any lumps, until thickened, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.
4. Add butter and stir until melted. Add the remaining 1/2 cup sugar, almond meal, vanilla extract, and almond extract. Let cool, stirring every so often to prevent a skin from forming.
5. Once cooled, use it right away or refrigerate until ready to use.
