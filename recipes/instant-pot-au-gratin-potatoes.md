## Ingredients

- 2 pounds russet potatoes, peeled
- 1 cup chicken broth
- ¼ cup diced onion
- 1 tablespoon parsley flakes
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon paprika
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon pepper
- ½ cup evaporated milk
- 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
- ½ cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese

## Instructions

1. Slice potatoes into 1/4-inch thick slices using a mandolin. Rinse under cold water to remove excess starch.
2. Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®). Add potatoes, chicken broth, onion, parsley, garlic powder, paprika, salt, and pepper. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 1 minute. Allow 10 minutes for pressure to build.
3. Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid.
4. Add evaporated milk, Cheddar cheese, and Monterey Jack cheese to the pot. Gently stir until cheese is melted. Transfer potatoes to an oven-safe baking dish.
5. Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler to low. Broil for 4 minutes or until top is brown and bubbly. Remove potatoes from the oven and let rest for 10 minutes to thicken.
