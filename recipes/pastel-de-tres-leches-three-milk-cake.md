## Ingredients

- 6  eggs, separated
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- ½ cup milk
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 cup heavy whipping cream  (Optional)
- 1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
- 1 (12 ounce) can evaporated milk
- 1 cup whipped cream  (Optional)
- 1 cup sliced fresh strawberries  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Grease a 10x15-inch baking dish.
3. Beat egg whites in a large mixing bowl with an electric mixer on high until stiff peaks form; gradually beat in sugar until mixture is glossy. Beat in egg yolks, one at a time, combining each yolk before adding the next. Reduce mixer speed to medium and add flour, about 1 tablespoon at a time, to the mixture, beating continuously; beat in baking powder, milk, and vanilla extract. Pour batter into prepared baking dish.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until cake is lightly browned and a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Let cake cool for 15 minutes.
5. Pour 1 cup cream, sweetened condensed milk, and evaporated milk in a blender and pulse several times until well blended. Pour three-milk mixture evenly over the cake. Refrigerate cake until cold and the milk mixture has soaked in, at least 1 hour.
6. Cut in squares and top each serving with a dollop of whipped cream and a few sliced strawberries. Refrigerate leftovers.
