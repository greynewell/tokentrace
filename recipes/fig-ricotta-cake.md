## Ingredients

- nonstick cooking spray
- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 2 ½ teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 ½ cups whole-milk ricotta cheese
- 1 cup white sugar
- ¾ cup unsalted butter, softened
- 3 large eggs, at room temperature
- 1 ½ teaspoons almond extract
- 4  fresh figs, chopped into 1/2-inch pieces
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
- 4  fresh fig slices
- 1 teaspoon confectioners' sugar, or as needed  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9-inch loaf pan with nonstick cooking spray.
2. Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl. Set aside.
3. Beat ricotta cheese, sugar, and butter together in a bowl using an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. Beat in eggs, one at a time, followed by almond extract. Beat in flour mixture on low speed, scraping down the sides of the bowl until combined; beat batter for about 30 seconds more.
4. Place chopped figs into a bowl, sprinkle 1 tablespoon flour over, and stir to coat. Fold figs into the batter. Pour into the prepared loaf pan. Place fig slices on top of the batter, down the center.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 45 to 60 minutes.
6. Remove from the oven and place on a wire rack to cool. Remove from the pan once the cake has cooled, 20 to 30 minutes. Dust with confectioners' sugar.
