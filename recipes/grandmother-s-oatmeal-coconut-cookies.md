## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups brown sugar
- 1 cup white sugar
- ¾ cup butter, softened
- 2  eggs
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon baking powder
- 1 cup oats
- 1 cup crispy rice cereal (such as Rice Krispies®)
- 1 cup flaked coconut

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Beat brown sugar, white sugar, and butter together with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Add 1 egg one at a time, allowing the first egg to blend into butter mixture before adding the next egg with vanilla.
3. Stir flour, baking soda, salt, and baking powder together in a bowl. Beat into butter mixture until just incorporated into a dough. Fold oats, crispy rice cereal, and coconut into dough; mixing just enough to evenly combine.
4. Drop cookie dough by teaspoonful onto baking sheets.
5. Bake in preheated oven until browned, 8 to 9 minutes. Cool cookies slightly on baking sheets before moving to cooling racks to cool completely.
