## Ingredients

- 1 (2 1/2 pound) boneless pork shoulder, cut into 2-inch cubes
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
- 1  bay leaf
- ¾ teaspoon caraway seed
- 1 (12 fluid ounce) bottle dark beer (such as Guinness®)
- 2 cups chicken broth
- 3  carrots, cut into 1-inch pieces
- 2 stalks celery, cut into 1-inch pieces
- ¼ cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
- 3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
- 12  Brussels sprouts, halved
- 3 cups mashed potatoes, or as needed
- 1 teaspoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Season pork cubes with salt and black pepper.
2. Heat vegetable oil in a pot over high heat. Working in batches, cook and stir pork in hot oil until browned on all sides, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer pork to a bowl and reduce heat to medium.
3. Melt butter in the pot. Cook and stir onion with a pinch of salt in hot butter until onion is softened and translucent, 7 to 10 minutes. Add garlic; saute until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
4. Stir flour into onion mixture; cook and stir until flour is completely incorporated, about 2 minutes. Add bay leaf and caraway seed; cook for 2 minutes more. Pour beer into onion mixture. Cook and stir until thickened, 1 to 3 minutes.
5. Stir pork, chicken broth, carrots, and celery into beer mixture; bring to simmer. Stir 1/4 cup parsley and balsamic vinegar into stew, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until pork is fork-tender, about 2 hours.
6. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the Brussels sprouts and cook uncovered until almost tender, about 5 minutes. Drain.
7. Stir Brussels sprouts into stew and simmer until heated through, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Divide mashed potatoes between 6 bowls. Ladle stew over potatoes and top each with a pinch of parsley.
