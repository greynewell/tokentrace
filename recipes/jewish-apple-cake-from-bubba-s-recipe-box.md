## Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ¾ cup white sugar
- 5 large Rome Beauty apples, peeled, cored, and chopped
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 4  eggs
- 2 cups white sugar
- 1 cup vegetable oil
- ¼ cup orange juice
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 inch tube pan.
2. Mix cinnamon, 3/4 cup of sugar, and apples in a bowl; set aside. Combine flour, salt, and baking powder in a bowl. Beat the eggs and 2 cups of sugar with an electric mixer until fluffy. Pour in the flour mixture alternately with the oil. Beat in the orange juice and vanilla until smooth and thoroughly mixed. Pour half of the batter into the prepared pan.
