## Ingredients

- 1 (15.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- ⅓ cup vegetable oil
- 3  eggs
- 1 cup Mott's® Natural Applesauce
- 1 cup confectioners' sugar
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 2 teaspoons milk, or as needed
- Chopped pecans for garnish

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) or to temperature indicated on cake mix package. Line 24 muffin cups with paper liners.
2. Pour cake mix into bowl and add 2 teaspoons cinnamon. Prepare cake batter (with vegetable oil and eggs) according to package directions.
3. Fill muffin cups 2/3 full, and bake according to package directions (typically 18 to 21 minutes) or until a toothpick inserted into the middle of a cupcake comes out clean.
4. Remove muffin pans from the oven, and allow to cool.
