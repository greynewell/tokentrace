## Ingredients

- 2 cloves garlic, crushed
- ½ cup vegetable oil
- ¼ cup coarsely ground fresh black pepper
- 2 tablespoons smoked paprika
- 2 teaspoons ground coriander
- 1 teaspoon dry mustard
- ½ teaspoon ground white pepper
- ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 4 pounds corned beef brisket

## Instructions

1. Mix vegetable oil and garlic in a small bowl; set aside for 1 hour.
2. Preheat the oven to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C).
3. Combine black pepper, paprika, coriander, dry mustard, white pepper, and cayenne pepper in a large bowl; set aside.
4. Cover a baking sheet with a large sheet of heavy-duty aluminum foil; coat with prepared garlic oil. Lay beef brisket on the oiled foil sheet and brush with remaining garlic oil. Cover brisket completely with pepper mixture, reserving 1 to 2 tablespoons.
5. Wrap brisket, fat-side up, in the sheet of foil. Place wrapped corned beef on another sheet of aluminum foil with the seam- and fat-sides down. Place double-wrapped brisket, seam-side down, on a third sheet of aluminum foil; wrap again.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 6 hours.
7. Remove pastrami from the oven and let cool to room temperature, about 3 hours. Do not remove the foil.
8. Place foil-wrapped pastrami in a freezer bag or other plastic bag; refrigerate for 8 to 10 hours.
9. Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source.
10. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
11. Remove pastrami from the refrigerator, unwrap, and place on the prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle top with 1 to 2 tablespoons remaining pepper mixture.
12. Place pastrami under the broiler and cook until surface browns, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove pastrami from the oven and cut into thin slices, about 1/8-inch thick.
13. Heat a large skillet over low heat.
14. Warm pastrami slices in the skillet with a few drops of water until fat turns translucent, about 5 minutes.
