## Ingredients

- ¾ cup sugar
- 4  large eggs
- 1 ¾ cups water
- 1 (14 ounce) can EAGLE BRAND® Sweetened Condensed Milk
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- ⅛ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup sugar
- ¼ cup water
- Ice

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Cook sugar in a heavy skillet over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until melted and caramel-colored. Carefully pour into eight 6-ounce ungreased custard cups, tilting to coat the bottom completely.
3. Beat eggs in a medium bowl; stir in water, sweetened condensed milk, vanilla, and salt. Pour into the prepared custard cups; set cups in a large shallow pan. Fill the pan with 1 inch of hot water.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Move the cups from the pan to a wire rack; cool for 1 hour. Chill for several hours or overnight.
5. Serve by loosening sides of flan with a small knife; invert onto rimmed serving plates. Top with sugar garnish, if desired, or garnish as desired.
6. Make sugar garnish: Fill a medium metal bowl halfway with ice. Combine sugar with water in a medium saucepan; stir. Cover; bring to a boil. Cook over high heat until light brown, 5 to 6 minutes. Immediately put the pan on ice for 1 minute. Carefully drizzle sugar decoratively over a foil-lined cookie sheet. Let cool, then peel from foil and use as garnish.
