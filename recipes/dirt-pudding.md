## Ingredients

- 2 (3.5 ounce) packages instant French vanilla pudding mix
- 3 cups milk
- 1 cup confectioners' sugar
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- ¼ cup butter, softened
- 1 (12 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed
- 1 (14 ounce) package chocolate cream-filled sandwich cookies, crushed (divided)

## Instructions

1. Whisk milk and pudding mix in a large bowl until softly set, about 2 minutes. The pudding will thicken as it stands.
2. Beat confectioners' sugar, cream cheese, and butter in a separate bowl until smooth and creamy. Stir cream cheese mixture into pudding until thoroughly combined; gently fold in frozen whipped topping.
3. Place 1/2 of the cookie crumbs into the bottom of a 9x12-inch dish; spread evenly. Cover cookie crumbs with pudding mixture and top with remaining crumbs, covering completely.
4. Chill for at least 30 minutes before serving.
