## Ingredients

- Ice Cream:
- 2 cups whole milk
- 1 cup heavy cream
- ¾ cup white sugar, divided
- 6 large egg yolks
- ¼ teaspoon table salt
- 2 ½ teaspoons peppermint extract
- 3 drops red food coloring
- ¾ cup crushed peppermint candy canes, or more to taste
- ¾ cup heavy cream
- ⅓ cup light corn syrup
- 5 tablespoons white sugar
- ¼ cup unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder
- 1 ¼ cups chopped bittersweet chocolate
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract
- ½ teaspoon table salt

## Instructions

1. Combine milk, cream, and 1/2 cup sugar for ice cream in a medium pot over medium heat; bring to a simmer.
2. Meanwhile, stir together egg yolks, remaining 1/4 cup sugar, and salt in a small bowl.
3. Pour some of the hot milk-cream mixture into the egg yolk mixture, whisking quickly to avoid scrambling the eggs. Pour the mixture back into the saucepan. Whisk and cook until custard coats the back of a spoon and does not flow when you run a finger through it, about 3 minutes.
4. Transfer custard to a clean bowl and refrigerate until cold, at least 2 hours but preferably overnight.
5. Remove custard from the refrigerator and stir in peppermint extract and food coloring. Pour mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer's instructions, about 20 minutes; add crushed candy canes at the end of the churning time, or right before. Transfer to an airtight container and freeze until firm, about 4 hours.
6. Combine cream, corn syrup, and sugar for hot fudge sauce in a medium saucepan. Sift in cocoa powder, stir, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Add chocolate, reduce heat to medium. Simmer, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, until completely melted. Remove from the heat and stir in butter, vanilla, and salt.
7. Place a scoop of peppermint ice cream into a bowl, dribble on some hot fudge sauce, and sprinkle with additional crushed candy canes.
