## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
- ½ teaspoon Creole seasoning
- 2 (6 ounce) fillets cod fillets
- ½ teaspoon smoked paprika
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 2  sub-style sandwich rolls, split
- 6 leaves romaine lettuce
- 4 slices tomato
- 2 tablespoons remoulade sauce, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Clean the grates of an outdoor grill, and preheat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Melt butter and stir in Creole seasoning and smoked paprika.
3. Pat fillets dry with a paper towel, and brush each side with the seasoned butter mixture.
4. Carefully oil grill grates and place fillets on the grill for 1 minute. Gently rotate the fish on the grate 60 to 90 degrees, to make grill marks, and continue grilling for 1 more minute. With a fish turner, turn fillets over and grill for 1 minute. Rotate and grill for 1 more minute. Fish is done when it flakes easily with a fork and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
5. Open sandwich rolls and place Romaine leaves and grilled fish inside. Top with tomato slices. Add remoulade sauce and serve.
