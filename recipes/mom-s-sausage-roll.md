## Ingredients

- 3 (1 pound) loaves frozen bread dough
- 2 pounds pork sausage
- 12  eggs
- 1 pound pepperoni sausage, diced
- 2 pounds provolone cheese, shredded
- 5  eggs, well beaten

## Instructions

1. Thaw the frozen bread dough.
2. Place sausage in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain and set aside.
3. In a large skillet over medium heat, rapidly cook and stir the eggs until solid. Remove from heat and set aside.
4. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking dish.
5. One loaf at a time on a lightly floured surface, roll the bread dough into a sheet approximately 1/4 inch or less thick. Spread 1/3 of the sausage, 1/3 of the eggs, 1/3 of the pepperoni and 1/3 of the Provolone cheese evenly over each dough sheet. Roll into a loaf.
6. One at a time, place rolled loaves into the prepared baking dish, brush with 1/3 of the beaten egg mixture and bake in the preheated oven 30 to 45 minutes, until golden brown. If desired, form loaves into a U shape before baking.
