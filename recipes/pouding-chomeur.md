## Ingredients

- 2 cups maple syrup
- 2 cups heavy cream
- ¾ cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
- ¾ cup white sugar
- ¼ teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2  eggs, at room temperature
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon fine salt
- 1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Butter a deep baking dish and place it on a sheet pan.
2. Bring maple syrup and heavy cream to a boil in a deep saucepan over medium-high heat. Turn off heat once mixture starts to bubble, stir, and set aside.
3. Beat butter and sugar together in a bowl using a spatula or electric mixer until creamy and well combined. Whisk in vanilla extract and 1 egg until incorporated. Mix in the other egg. Sprinkle in baking powder, salt, and flour. Mix with a spatula until batter is just combined.
4. Transfer batter to the prepared dish and pour the maple-cream sauce on top, stopping between 1/2 to 1-inch from the top of the dish. Reserve any extra sauce.
5. Bake in the center of the preheated oven until pudding is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out mostly clean, about 30 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes; serve pudding with any extra maple-cream sauce.
