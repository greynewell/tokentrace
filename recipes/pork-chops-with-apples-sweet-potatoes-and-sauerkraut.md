## Ingredients

- 4  (1 inch thick) boneless pork chops
- 2 medium sweet potatoes, peeled and sliced 1/2 inch thick
- 1 medium onion, sliced
- 2  apples - peeled, cored and sliced
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- ½ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 1 (16 ounce) can sauerkraut, drained

## Instructions

1. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat and coat with cooking spray. Quickly brown the pork chops on each side. Set aside.
