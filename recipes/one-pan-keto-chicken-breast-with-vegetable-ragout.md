## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
- 1  zucchini, halved and sliced
- 1  yellow summer squash, quartered and sliced
- 1 pound Roma tomatoes, chopped
- salt and pepper to taste
- 1 ½ tablespoons cantanzaro herbs (from Savory Spice Shop®), divided
- 3 (5 ounce) boneless skinless chicken breasts, butterflied
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- ¼ cup whipped cream cheese
- ¼ cup 1% milk
- ½ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for serving

## Instructions

1. Combine 1 tablespoon olive oil, zucchini, summer squash, and tomatoes in a bowl; toss to combine. Season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1 1/2 teaspoons cantanzaro herbs; mix well. Season chicken breasts with the remaining cantanzaro herbs, salt, and pepper on all sides.
