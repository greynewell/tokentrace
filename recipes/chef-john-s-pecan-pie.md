## Ingredients

- 1  prepared pastry dough for 9-inch pie
- 2 cups pecan halves
- 1 cup light brown sugar
- ½ cup butter
- ½ cup white sugar
- ½ cup light corn syrup
- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons milk
- 1 tablespoon bourbon
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 3  large eggs, whisked

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Roll pie dough in a 9 1/2-inch glass pie dish and crimp the edges. Cover dough in parchment paper and press paper down to line the dough; pour pie weights on top of the parchment paper and spread evenly over the bottom.
3. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Remove parchment paper and pie weights to a bowl. Bake crust until lightly golden and set, about 10 minutes more.
4. Spread pecans out on a baking sheet. Bake in the oven until lightly toasted, 7 to 8 minutes.
5. Stir brown sugar, butter, white sugar, corn syrup, flour, milk, bourbon, vanilla extract, and salt together in a saucepan over medium heat; bring to a boil, whisking constantly. Remove from heat and cool for 5 to 10 minutes.
6. Whisk eggs in a large bowl. Slowly drizzle sugar mixture into eggs, whisking constantly.
7. Spread pecans out in the bottom of the crust. Pour sugar mixture over nuts and gently stir with a spatula to coat all of the nuts.
8. Bake pie in the preheated oven until crust is golden brown and pie is set, 40 to 45 minutes. Cool completely.
