## Ingredients

- ½ (15 ounce) package refrigerated pie crust
- 1 cup diced fresh strawberries
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 1 large egg, beaten

## Instructions

1. Bring pie crust to room temperature. Place strawberries in a bowl and sprinkle with sugar. Set aside.
2. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
3. Roll out pie crust. Use a 4-inch pastry cutter to cut out 6 rounds.
4. Divide strawberries equally amongst the 6 rounds. Wet fingers with water and run them along the edges of each round. Fold rounds in half and press edges together using the tines of a fork until sealed. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Brush with beaten egg and cut a small slit in each pie.
