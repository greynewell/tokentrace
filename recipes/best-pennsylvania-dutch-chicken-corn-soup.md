## Ingredients

- 2 (3 pound) whole chickens, cut into pieces
- 3 quarts water
- 3  onions, minced
- 1 cup chopped celery
- 2 ½ tablespoons salt
- 1 ¼ teaspoons ground nutmeg
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 10 ears fresh corn
- 3  eggs
- 1 cup sifted all-purpose flour
- ½ cup milk

## Instructions

1. Combine chicken, water, onions, celery, salt, nutmeg, and pepper in a large stockpot over medium heat and bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, adding water as needed, until chicken is very tender, about 2 hours.
2. Transfer chicken to a deep dish; pour soup into a large jug or bowl. Cover and refrigerate chicken and soup for 6 to 8 hours.
3. Remove and discard the layer of fat that has solidified on the surface of soup. Transfer soup into a large pot over medium heat; stir in corn and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until corn is tender, 10 to 15 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, place 2 of the eggs in a small saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Cover and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool, peel, and chop. Set aside.
5. Chop chilled chicken meat into small chunks; stir into soup.
6. Beat remaining egg in a medium bowl until light in color. Beat in flour and milk until smooth. Drop pea-sized lumps of rivel dough into the soup, a few at a time, to make small dumplings. Cook, stirring constantly, until dumplings hold their shape and float to the surface, 2 to 5 minutes. Stir in chopped egg.
