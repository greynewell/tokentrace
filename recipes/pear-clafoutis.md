## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened, divided
- 3 large eggs
- ⅓ cup white sugar, or to taste
- 1 ¼ cups whole milk
- ¼ teaspoon fine salt
- 1 pinch freshly grated nutmeg
- 1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract
- ½ teaspoon almond extract
- ⅔ cup all-purpose flour
- 3 cups thinly sliced sweet, ripe pears
- ½ cup toasted sliced almonds
- ½ tablespoon white sugar, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 10-inch baking dish generously with 1 tablespoon butter.
2. Whisk eggs, 1/3 cup sugar, milk, salt, nutmeg, vanilla extract, almond extract, and flour together in a bowl.
3. Reserve 12 to 14 pear slices for topping; add remaining pear slices to the prepared baking dish. Pour egg custard mixture over pears in the baking dish and top with almonds. Shake and tap the dish gently on the countertop to let mixture settle. Lay reserved pear slices flat on top. Melt remaining butter and brush over pears. Sprinkle with 1/2 tablespoon sugar.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until top is golden, fruit is soft, and custard is set, about 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool to room temperature before serving, or serve chilled.
