## Ingredients

- 2 ½ cups sliced fresh strawberries, divided
- ½ cup water
- 3 tablespoons white sugar
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
- 1 (8 ounce) package refrigerated crescent roll dough (such as Pillsbury®
- 2 teaspoons heavy whipping cream
- 2 teaspoons white sugar
- 2 cups whipped cream

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Place 1/2 cup strawberries and water in a food processor and process until smooth.
3. Combine 3 tablespoons sugar and cornstarch in a saucepan. Add pureed strawberries. Cook and stir until strawberry sauce has thickened, about 5 minutes. Stir in remaining 2 cups sliced strawberries and lemon juice. Set aside.
4. Unroll dough. Place 1 crescent atop another and roll up, starting at the smallest end, to make 4 double-rolled crescents. Brush each roll with 1/2 teaspoon heavy whipping cream and sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon sugar.
5. Bake crescents until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely.
6. Split each roll in half horizontally and fill with strawberries. Top with 1/2 cup whipped cream and the top half of the crescent roll. Top with more strawberries.
