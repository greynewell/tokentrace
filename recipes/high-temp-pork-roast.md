## Ingredients

- 2 pounds pork roast
- ¼ cup Worcestershire sauce
- 2 teaspoons coarse ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon coarse sea salt
- 1 teaspoon Montreal steak seasoning
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).
2. Rinse roast under cold running water to wet exterior. Pat dry. Use a brush or paper towel to spread Worcestershire sauce evenly over the exterior. Season roast with pepper, salt, steak seasoning, onion powder, and garlic powder on all sides.
3. Place roast fat-side up into a shallow roasting pan and place on the middle rack in the oven.
4. Roast in the preheated oven until cooked to desired doneness, 20 minutes for medium, 24 minutes for medium-well, or 28 minutes for well done. Turn off the oven and leave roast in the oven, without opening the door, for an additional 40 minutes.
5. Remove from the oven and cover loosely with aluminum foil. Let rest for 10 to 15 minutes to allow juices to settle back down into the roast. Slice thinly and serve.
