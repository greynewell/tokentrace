## Ingredients

- nonstick cooking spray
- 1 ⅔ cups all-purpose flour
- ¾ cup white sugar
- ½ cup brown sugar
- ½ cup ground pistachio nuts
- 1 cup chopped pistachio nuts, divided
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup milk, at room temperature
- 8 tablespoons melted butter
- 2  eggs, at room temperature
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon almond extract

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners. Lightly spray liners and pan with cooking spray.
2. Stir flour, sugar, brown sugar, ground pistachio nuts, 1/2 cup chopped pistachio nuts, cornstarch, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Make a well in the center.
3. Whisk together milk, melted butter, eggs, vanilla extract, and almond extract together in a bowl. Pour milk mixture into the well of the dry ingredients and mix with a spatula just until batter is combined but a few lumps remain; do not overmix.
4. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 3/4 full. Sprinkle remaining chopped pistachios on top.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, about 15 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through. Cool in the tin for 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
