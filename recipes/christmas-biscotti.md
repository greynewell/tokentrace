## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon baking soda
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ⅔ cup white sugar
- ½ cup butter
- 2 large eggs
- ½ teaspoon orange oil
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- ½ cup white chocolate chips
- ½ cup dried cranberries
- ½ cup coarsely chopped pecans

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 cookie sheets.
2. Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl.
