## Ingredients

- 2 cups white sugar
- 1 (3 ounce) package strawberry flavored Jell-O®
- 1 cup butter, softened
- 4  eggs (room temperature)
- 2 ¾ cups sifted cake flour
- 2 ½ teaspoons baking powder
- 1 cup whole milk, room temperature
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- ½ cup strawberry puree made from frozen sweetened strawberries

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.
2. Beat sugar, butter, and dry strawberry gelatin together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.
3. Combine flour and baking powder in a large bowl; stir into butter mixture alternately with milk. Blend in strawberry puree and vanilla. Divide batter evenly between the prepared pans.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 25 to 30 minutes. Cool cakes on a wire rack for 10 minutes; run a table knife around the edges to loosen. Invert carefully onto a serving plate or cooling rack to cool completely.
