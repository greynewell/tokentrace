## Ingredients

- 6 (6 ounce) boneless center-cut pork chops
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- ¼ cup apple cider vinegar
- 2 cups apple cider
- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- 1 teaspoon minced rosemary
- 1 pinch red pepper flakes

## Instructions

1. Season pork chops with salt and black pepper.
2. Heat oil and butter in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Cook pork chops in the hot oil mixture until browned on both sides and pork is slightly pink in the center, 5 to 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Remove pan from the heat; transfer pork chops to a plate.
3. Stir garlic into the pan and place over medium-high heat; cook and stir for 30 seconds. Pour in vinegar and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Add apple cider and Dijon mustard, bring mixture to a boil, and cook until sauce is reduced and thick, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in rosemary and red pepper flakes; season with salt and black pepper to taste.
4. Return pork chops to the pan to warm slightly, 1 to 2 minutes per side.
