## Ingredients

- ½ cup unsalted butter, melted
- ½ cup firmly packed brown sugar
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 1 large egg, room temperature
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- ½ teaspoon almond extract
- 1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
- ¼ teaspoon baking soda
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1 pinch ground nutmeg
- ½ cup fresh blueberries
- ½ cup fresh blackberries
- ½ cup fresh raspberries
- ½ cup sliced fresh strawberries
- ½ cup white chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 9x9-inch pan with enough parchment paper to have overhang on all sides.
2. Mix together melted butter, brown sugar, and white sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer until thoroughly combined and mixture begins to lighten in color. Mix in egg, vanilla, and almond extract until thoroughly combined. Add in flour, baking soda, salt, and nutmeg, and mix until just combined. Gently fold in berries and white chocolate chips.
3. Pour batter into the prepared pan. Carefully spread into an even layer.
4. Place pan into preheated oven and bake until blondies are golden brown and set, 35 to 40 minutes. Remove blondies from oven and allow to cool completely in the pan. Gently lift out of the pan using the excess parchment paper. Cut into 16 squares.
