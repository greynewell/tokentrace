## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 (8 ounce) package sliced cremini mushrooms
- 1  onion, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- ½ teaspoon dried oregano
- ½ teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 ½ cups orzo
- ½ cup dry white wine
- 3 cups low-sodium chicken broth
- 1 cup frozen peas
- ½ cup freshly grated Pecorino-Romano cheese, or to taste
- ¼ cup heavy whipping cream
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add mushrooms and onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Add garlic, oregano, and thyme; cook 1 minute, stirring often. Add orzo and cook until lightly toasted, 1 to 2 minutes, stirring often. Pour in wine and cook until mostly evaporated, 1 to 2 minutes more.
2. Pour chicken broth into the pot gradually and bring to a simmer. Cover the pot, reduce heat to low, and cook until orzo is softened, 10 to 12 minutes, stirring occasionally.
3. Uncover the pot and stir in frozen peas. Cook until peas are warmed through, about 1 minute. Remove pot from heat, add Pecorino-Romano cheese and cream and stir to combine. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.
