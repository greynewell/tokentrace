## Ingredients

- 1 ½ teaspoons dried thyme
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 4  skinless, boneless chicken thighs
- cooking spray
- 1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
- 4  shallots, chopped
- ½ cup chicken broth
- ¼ cup balsamic vinegar
- 1 tablespoon honey

## Instructions

1. Sprinkle thyme and black pepper over chicken thighs. Spray a nonstick pan with cooking spray and heat over medium-high heat. Cook chicken thighs on both sides until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 10 to 15 minutes. Be careful not to overcook. Remove from pan and keep warm.
