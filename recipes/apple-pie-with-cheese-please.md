## Ingredients

- 1 (9 inch) frozen pie crust, thawed
- 6 slices Cheddar cheese
- 5 medium apples - peeled, cored, and thinly sliced
- ½ cup butter
- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- ½ cup white sugar
- ½ cup brown sugar
- ¼ cup water
- 1 (9 inch) prepared pie crust, at room temperature
- 1  egg white
- 1 teaspoon water

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Line the bottom of the pie crust with Cheddar cheese slices. Place apples into the crust in a circular fashion, layering slices on top of one another. Set aside.
3. Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add flour and mix well to combine, removing any lumps. Add white sugar, brown sugar, and 1/4 cup water. Bring to a slight simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool, 5 to 10 minutes.
4. Pour butter mixture over apples to cover all slices. Top with additional pie crust; seal edges. Pierce the top with a fork to allow steam to release. Mix egg white and 1 teaspoon water together in a small bowl; baste over pie crust using a basting brush.
5. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
6. Continue to bake until golden and set, about 35 minutes more.
