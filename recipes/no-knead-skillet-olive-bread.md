## Ingredients

- 2 cups lukewarm water (105 degrees F, 40 degrees C)
- 1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
- ½ tablespoon salt
- 4 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour, divided
- 1 cup marinated olives (such as Star® Garlic & Basil) - drained, chopped, and herbs and garlic reserved
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided

- 1 teaspoon dried parsley, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Combine water and yeast in a large mixing bowl. Add 1 cup flour and 1/2 tablespoon salt. Stir using a wooden spoon until combined. Stir in olives, reserved herbs and garlic, and garlic powder. Add remaining flour 1 cup at a time, stirring until thoroughly combined. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and set in a warm spot to rise for 1 hour.
