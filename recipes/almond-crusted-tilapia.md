## Ingredients

- 2  eggs
- 1 teaspoon lemon pepper
- 1 teaspoon garlic pepper
- 1 cup ground almonds
- 1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
- 8 (6 ounce) tilapia fillets
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour for dusting
- 6 tablespoons butter
- salt to taste
- 1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
- 8 sprigs parsley
- 8  lemon wedges

## Instructions

1. Beat the eggs with the lemon pepper and garlic pepper until blended; set aside. Stir together ground almonds with 1 cup of Parmesan cheese in a shallow dish until combined; set aside. Dust the tilapia fillets with flour, and shake off excess. Dip the tilapia in egg, then press into the almond mixture.
2. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook tilapia in melted butter until golden brown on both sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Reduce heat to medium, and season fillets with salt if desired. Sprinkle the tilapia with the remaining Parmesan cheese, cover, and continue cooking until the Parmesan cheese has melted, about 5 minutes.
3. Transfer the tilapia to a serving dish, and garnish with parsley springs and lemon wedges to serve.
