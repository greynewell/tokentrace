## Ingredients

- 1 quart strawberries, sliced
- 1 cup white sugar
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ⅓ cup vegetable shortening
- 1 ½ cups milk
- 2 tablespoons butter, softened
- 1 cup whipped cream

## Instructions

1. Mix strawberries and 1 cup sugar in a bowl and allow to stand while you complete remaining steps. Stir occasionally to help juice form.
2. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch round baking pan.
3. Combine flour, 2 tablespoons sugar, baking powder, and salt in a bowl; cut in shortening with a knife or pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir milk into crumb mixture until just blended; pour into prepared baking pan.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes; cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing shortcake.
5. Split shortcake into two layers; spread bottom layer with 2 tablespoons softened butter and top with strawberries and juice. Place top layer over strawberries. Serve with whipped cream.
