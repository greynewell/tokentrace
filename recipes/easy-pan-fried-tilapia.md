## Ingredients

- 4 (4 ounce) fillets tilapia fillets, or more to taste
- 1 pinch Cajun seasoning, or to taste
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour, or as needed
- 2 tablespoons salted butter
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- ½ cup chopped onion
- ¼ cup white cooking wine, or more as needed
- ¼ cup capers

## Instructions

1. Dry tilapia fillets and cut each in half. Season each fillet with Cajun seasoning, salt, and pepper. Dredge in flour to coat, shaking off excess.
2. Melt butter and oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Pan-fry fish quickly, working in batches if needed, until edges appear white, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and continue to cook until easily flaked with a fork, 3 to 4 minutes more. Remove to a plate and keep warm.
3. Heat the same pan over medium-high heat. Saute onion until soft, about 5 minutes. Pour white wine into the pan, reduce heat, and let simmer until reduced by about half, 5 to 7 minutes. Drizzle sauce over fish before serving and garnish with capers.
