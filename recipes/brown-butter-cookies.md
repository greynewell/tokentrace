## Ingredients

- 2 cups butter
- 2 cups brown sugar
- 2  eggs
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- ⅔ cup chopped pecans
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 3 ½ cups confectioners' sugar
- ½ cup hot water

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Heat butter over medium heat for 5 minutes or so, until it turns nut brown in color. The foaming and bubbling are part of the browning process, but watch carefully so that it doesn't burn. Remove from heat; cool slightly. Reserve 1/2 cup of browned butter to make the icing.
3. Pour remaining browned butter into a large mixing bowl. Beat browned butter with brown sugar until the butter is no longer hot. Mix in eggs, 2 teaspoons vanilla, baking soda, baking powder, and salt; beat thoroughly. Mix in flour and chopped pecans. Drop tablespoons of dough onto ungreased baking sheets.
4. Bake for 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until light brown around the edges; cool.
5. In a medium bowl, mix the reserved 1/2 cup browned butter with 2 teaspoons vanilla, confectioners' sugar, and hot water. Beat until smooth; use to frost cookies when they are cool.
