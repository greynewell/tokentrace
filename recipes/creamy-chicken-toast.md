## Ingredients

- 12 ounces skinless, boneless chicken breast, cut into strips
- salt to taste
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 2 tablespoons sliced green onions, white and lighter green parts, or to taste
- ½  red bell pepper, or to taste, diced
- 1 large jalapeno pepper, or to taste, seeded and diced
- ¼ cup chicken broth
- 1 ½ cups heavy cream
- 2 tablespoons creme fraiche  (Optional)
- 1 pinch ground black pepper
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh tarragon
- 4 slices bread, toasted

## Instructions

1. Season chicken with salt.
2. Heat butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chicken until outside firms up and inside is still medium-rare, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a plate and let cool.
3. Reduce heat to medium. Combine green onions, red bell pepper, and jalapeno in the skillet. Add a pinch of salt. Cook and stir until softened, about 5 minutes. Increase heat to high. Pour in chicken broth. Stir until liquid is mostly evaporated. Stir in cream. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and cook until sauce is reduced to desired thickness, 6 to 10 minutes.
4. Cut chicken into evenly sized cubes. Add chicken, accumulated juices, and creme fraiche to the sauce. Cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center, 3 to 7 minutes more. Season with salt, pepper, and cayenne. Turn off heat. Stir in tarragon and spoon chicken and sauce over toast.
