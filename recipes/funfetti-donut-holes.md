## Ingredients

- 2 cups confectioners' sugar
- ¼ cup multicolored candy sprinkles
- 3 tablespoons whole milk
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 pinch salt
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar, or more to taste
- 1 ½ tablespoons baking powder
- ¾ teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 cup milk
- 1  egg
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ¼ cup unsalted butter, melted
- ¼ cup multicolored candy sprinkles
- vegetable oil for frying

## Instructions

1. Whisk confectioners' sugar, 1/4 cup sprinkles, 3 tablespoons milk, lemon juice, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, and 1 pinch salt together in a bowl to make a smooth glaze.
2. Whisk flour, brown sugar, baking powder, and 3/4 teaspoon salt together in a large bowl.
3. Combine 1 cup milk, egg, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract in a small bowl. Stir into the flour mixture. Add melted butter and 1/4 cup sprinkles; mix until a soft dough forms.
4. Heat at least 2 inches of oil in a large pot to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet or wire rack with paper towels.
5. Scoop a few tablespoons of dough into the hot oil using a small ice cream scoop. Fry donut holes until golden brown, about 1 minute per side. Transfer donut holes to the paper towels using a slotted spoon; let drain and cool slightly. Repeat with remaining dough.
6. Place a wire rack on a baking sheet. Dip one donut hole at a time into the glaze and place on the wire rack; allow excess glaze to drip off before serving.
