## Ingredients

- 1 (15.25 ounce) package vanilla cake mix (such as Betty Crocker®)
- 1 cup water
- 3  eggs
- ⅓ cup vegetable oil
- 2 (3.4 ounce) packages instant lemon pudding mix, divided
- 2 (8 ounce) containers whipped topping (such as Cool Whip), divided
- 2 (16 ounce) packages fresh strawberries, diced, divided
- ¾ cup white sugar
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch
- 2 tablespoons lemon zest, divided

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan.
2. Combine cake mix, water, eggs, oil, and 1 box lemon pudding in a large bowl; beat using an electric mixer on low speed until moistened. Increase speed to medium and beat for 2 minutes. Pour batter into the prepared baking pan.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 28 to 33 minutes. Immediately after baking, poke holes down through cake with the rounded handle of a wooden spoon in 1-inch intervals. Set aside to cool for 20 minutes.
4. While cake is baking, combine one 8-ounce container of whipped topping with remaining package of lemon pudding mix in a small bowl. Mix until pudding is well incorporated. Place in the refrigerator until ready to use.
5. Add one 16-ounce package of diced strawberries to a saucepan with sugar, cornstarch, and 2 teaspoons lemon zest. Cook over medium heat until it begins to boil, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and allow to simmer until strawberries soften, sugar has fully dissolved, and syrup has thickened, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool.
6. Spread lemon pudding mixture evenly across the cooled cake, allowing it to go into the holes. Pour and spread strawberry syrup mixture on top of the lemon layer. Cover and refrigerate for 4 hours.
7. Frost cake with remaining 8 ounces of whipped topping and top with remaining strawberries and remaining lemon zest.
