## Ingredients

- ½ cup white sugar
- ½ cup butter
- 1  egg
- 1 cup molasses
- 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ teaspoons baking soda
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon ground ginger
- ½ teaspoon ground cloves
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup hot water

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9-inch square baking pan.
2. Beat butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer until creamy. Add sugar and beat until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Mix in egg, then mix in molasses until smooth.
3. Sift flour, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and salt into a large bowl. Gradually add dry ingredients to the molasses mixture, mixing after each addition until incorporated. Mix in water until smooth. Pour cake batter into the prepared pan.
4. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Insert a toothpick in the center of the cake; it should come out clean. If it does, remove cake from the oven; if not, bake 15 to 30 more minutes, checking often for doneness.
5. Allow gingerbread to cool in the pan before serving.
