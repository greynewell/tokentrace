## Ingredients

- 4 small ripe peaches, washed and dried
- 1 (9 inch) prepared, unbaked pie crust, thawed
- ¼ cup butter
- ½ cup confectioners' sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ¼ teaspoon ground allspice
- 1 pinch salt
- ¼ cup heavy cream

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Lightly grease the bottom of a shallow baking pan.
3. Unroll the prepared pie crust onto a lightly floured surface, and cut into 1/2 inch wide strips.
4. Place peach stem side down, and wrap strips of dough--over-lapping rows--around the fruit so it's completely covered.
5. For ease, twirl the peach while holding the pastry in place and overlap rows.
6. When completely wrapped, the peach will resemble a beehive.
7. Make sure the entire peach is covered and sealed inside the crust.
8. Repeat with remaining peaches.
9. Arrange the wrapped peaches in a shallow baking pan.
10. Bake peaches in preheated oven until crust turns golden brown, 35 to 40 minutes.
11. Meanwhile, cream butter with 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar in a mixing bowl until light and fluffy.
12. Beat in the vanilla extract, allspice, salt, and heavy cream until well blended.
13. Stir in the remaining 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar.
14. To serve, place baked peaches in serving bowls.
15. Slice each peach in half and remove the pits.
16. Spoon hard sauce over the peach halves.
