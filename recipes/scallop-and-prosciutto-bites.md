## Ingredients

- 1 pound large scallops
- 4 ounces thinly sliced prosciutto
- toothpicks
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 3 tablespoons white wine

## Instructions

1. Wrap each scallop with a thin slice of prosciutto and secure with a toothpick.
2. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place the scallops into the pan, and cook for about 2 minutes on each side. Season each side with pepper as it is cooking. Once each side has been fried, sprinkle the white wine over the scallops, and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes.
