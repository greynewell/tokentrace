## Ingredients

- 1 bunch asparagus, trimmed and cut into 1/2-inch pieces
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 cup cold milk
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
- ½ clove garlic, minced
- 4  eggs, separated
- ½ cup grated sharp white Cheddar cheese

## Instructions

1. Cook asparagus in a saucepan of boiling water until bright green but still crisp, about 2 minutes. Transfer asparagus to ice water to stop the cooking process. Drain and set aside.
2. Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk in flour and stir until mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown, about 2 minutes.
3. Whisk milk into butter-flour mixture; bring to a simmer and cook until thick, 2 to 3 minutes. Season with salt and cayenne pepper.
4. Place milk mixture, garlic, and asparagus in a blender and puree until smooth.
5. Pour asparagus mixture into a large bowl; stir in egg yolks and Cheddar cheese.
6. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C)
7. Generously butter 4 (6-ounce) ramekins
8. Beat egg whites in a large glass or metal mixing bowl until soft peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites will form soft mounds rather than a sharp peak
9. Stir half of egg whites into asparagus cheese mixture until just combined. Gently fold remaining egg whites into mixture.
10. Fill prepared ramekins about 3/4 full and place on a baking sheet; bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden brown, about 20 to 25 minutes
