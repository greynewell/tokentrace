## Ingredients

- ¾ cup uncooked basmati rice
- 5 cups water
- ¼ cup butter
- 3 pounds sweet onions, coarsely chopped
- 1 cup half-and-half cream
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt
- 2 cups shredded Swiss cheese, divided

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 2-quart baking dish.
2. Bring water to a boil in a large saucepan, and sprinkle in the rice. Stir, reduce heat to low, and simmer the rice until it is half-cooked, about 5 minutes. Drain the rice, and set aside.
3. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat, and cook and stir the onions until translucent but not browned, about 8 minutes. Mix the cooked onions and the butter from the skillet with the rice, and stir in the half-and-half, salt, and 1 3/4 cup of the Swiss cheese. Transfer the mixture to the prepared baking dish, and sprinkle the remaining 1/4 cup of Swiss cheese over the top.
4. Bake uncovered in the preheated oven until the rice is tender and the top is lightly browned, about 1 hour.
