## Ingredients

- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- ¼ cup white sugar
- ¼ teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 tablespoon milk  (Optional)
- 1 (16 ounce) package egg roll wrappers
- 1 cup chocolate chips, or as needed
- vegetable oil for frying

## Instructions

1. Mix cream cheese and sugar in a bowl until smooth. Stir in vanilla extract. Thin filling with a little milk if it appears too thick; it should be the consistency of jelly.
2. Lay out 1 egg roll on a flat work surface. Add about 2 tablespoons of the cream cheese filling down the middle. Sprinkle a few chocolate chips on top. Brush edges of the wrapper with water. Fold in sides and roll up, pressing in edges to seal. Place seam side-down on a plate. Repeat with remaining wrappers, filling, and chocolate chips.
3. Heat oil in a deep saucepan over medium heat. Fry egg rolls in batches until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels.
