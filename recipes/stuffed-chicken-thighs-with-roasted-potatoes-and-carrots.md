## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 6  skinless, boneless chicken thighs
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1  egg
- ¾ cup shredded mozzarella cheese, divided
- 1 small onion, minced
- 1  Roma tomato, seeded and diced
- 10  black olives, pitted and minced
- ½ cup seasoned bread crumbs
- 6  toothpicks
- 1 pound red potatoes, scrubbed and halved
- 1 pound carrots, peeled and cut into 3-inch pieces
- olive oil, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil; grease with cooking spray.
2. Spread chicken thighs open on a flat work surface. Pound to an even thickness with the flat side of a meat mallet. Season with salt and pepper.
3. Beat egg with a fork in large bowl. Stir in 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese, onion, tomato, and black olives. Mix in enough bread crumbs to bind the filling together.
4. Put a spoonful of the filling in the center of each chicken thigh. Fold chicken over filling, tucking in any loose ends. Secure chicken thighs with toothpicks; arrange on the prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle remaining 1/4 cup mozzarella cheese over chicken thighs.
5. Arrange potatoes and carrots around chicken thighs. Drizzle olive oil over vegetables; season with salt and pepper.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until chicken juices run clear and vegetables are tender, 35 to 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the chicken should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
