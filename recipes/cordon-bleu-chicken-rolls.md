## Ingredients

- 8  skinless, boneless chicken breasts
- 8 slices cooked ham
- 4 slices Swiss cheese, cut into 1 inch pieces
- salt and pepper to taste
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- ¼ cup melted butter
- ½ cup cornflakes cereal crumbs
- 1 (10.75 ounce) can  condensed cream of chicken soup
- ½ cup sour cream
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
2. Make the chicken rolls: Place each chicken breast half between sheets of plastic wrap and pound with a meat mallet to about 1/8 inch thickness. Place a piece of cheese on each ham slice and sprinkle lightly with thyme and salt and pepper to taste. Roll up seasoned ham and cheese jellyroll-style, then roll each chicken breast with ham and cheese inside. Tuck in ends and fasten with toothpicks.
3. Place melted butter in a small bowl and place cereal crumbs in a shallow dish or bowl. Dip each chicken roll in butter, then roll in crumbs, turning to coat thoroughly. Place coated rolls in the prepared baking dish.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is golden brown and juices run clear, about 40 minutes.
5. While the chicken is cooking, prepare the cordon bleu sauce: Mix together condensed soup, sour cream, and lemon juice in a small saucepan. Heat over low heat, stirring occasionally, until combined. Serve hot over chicken rolls.
