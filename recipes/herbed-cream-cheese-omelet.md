## Ingredients

- 4 ounces cream cheese, softened
- ½ cup fresh cilantro leaves
- salt and pepper to taste
- 3 tablespoons butter
- 8  eggs

## Instructions

1. Mix together cream cheese and cilantro in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper.
2. Heat 1/4 of the butter in a well-seasoned omelet pan or 8-inch nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat. When butter is hot and bubbling, swirl it around in the pan.
3. Just before butter begins to brown, beat 2 eggs and pour into the pan. Reduce heat.
4. After 10 seconds or so, omelet will coagulate. Push omelet to one side of the pan with a spoon or spatula to allow raw egg to flow onto the cleared skillet. Repeat this one more time, then remove the skillet from heat.
5. Dab 1/4 of the herbed cream cheese in a line along the middle of omelet. Season with salt and pepper. If omelet has not completely set, place the pan over medium heat for 30 more seconds.
6. Slide omelet from the pan onto a plate, so it rolls up, enclosing herbed cream cheese filling. Make 3 more omelets the same way.
