## Ingredients

- 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ cup shortening
- 1 cup whole milk

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. In a large bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder and salt. Cut in shortening with a pastry blender or by rubbing between your fingers until the lumps are smaller than peas. Pour in the milk all at once, and stir with a large spoon until dough is evenly moist. It should be sticky.
3. Flour your hands, and knead the dough lightly for 3 or 4 turns, adding just enough flour so that it doesn't stick to your hands. Let the dough rest for a minute or two.
4. With well-floured hands, pinch off pieces of dough (about 12) and pat lightly into balls. Don't over work the dough. Place about 2 inches apart on ungreased baking sheets. With floured knuckles, press each ball down to about 1/2 inch thickness.
5. Bake for 11 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven, until browned on the bottom. Serve hot with butter.
