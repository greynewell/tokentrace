## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon sea salt
- ¾ cup cold butter
- ¼ cup shortening
- ½ cup ice water
- 8 cups fresh blackberries
- 1 cup white sugar
- 6 tablespoons potato starch

## Instructions

1. Mix flour and salt together in a medium mixing bowl. Cut in butter and shortening using a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse oatmeal. Stir in ice water until dough comes together into a ball. Divide into 2 pieces.
2. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
3. Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface and roll out into 10-inch crusts. Place 1 crust into a 9-inch pie pan.
4. Combine blackberries, sugar, and potato starch in a large mixing bowl. Pour the berry mixture into the pie crust. Lay the second crust over the berries. Press edges together to seal; crimp with a fork. Make 4 small slits in the top crust.
5. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking until top is golden brown, about 45 minutes.
6. Let cool completely until set, about 2 hours.
