## Ingredients

- 1 large baking potato
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
- ¼ cup chopped onions
- ½ cup chopped mushrooms
- salt to taste
- 2 tablespoons nonfat plain yogurt

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
2. Pierce potato a few times with a fork. Place onto a microwave-safe plate and microwave on high until tender but not mushy, about 10 minutes. Transfer potato to a baking dish.
3. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes.
4. While the potato is baking, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until tender, about 5 minutes. Mix in mushrooms and season with salt. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook without stirring until mushrooms are tender, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.
5. Remove potato from the oven. Slice halfway through the potato lengthwise and squeeze gently to open. Top with onion-mushroom mixture and yogurt.
