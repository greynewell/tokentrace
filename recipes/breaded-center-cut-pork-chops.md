## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 6  eggs
- ⅛ cup milk
- 2 cups seasoned bread crumbs
- 1 teaspoon lemon pepper
- 1 tablespoon dried parsley
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- ¼ teaspoon dried dill weed
- 1 teaspoon Italian-style seasoning
- 6  (3/4 inch thick) center cut pork chops

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Place the flour in a bowl. Combine the eggs and milk in a separate bowl, mixing together well, and then place the bread crumbs in another separate bowl. To the bread crumbs stir in the lemon pepper, parsley, garlic powder, dill and Italian-style seasoning.
3. Dip each chop into the flour, shaking off any excess flour, then dip into the egg/milk mixture, and, finally, dredge each chop liberally in the bread crumbs.
4. Lay the chops into a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish and pour water as needed into the dish, enough to just cover the bottom.
5. Bake for 40 minutes, then reduce heat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for 20 more minutes.
