## Ingredients

- 8 small lobster tails
- ½ cup salted butter, melted
- ½ tablespoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon dried parsley
- 1 pinch seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®), or to taste
- ½  lemon, juiced

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Cut the lobster tails straight down the middle using kitchen shears. Butterfly the lobster meat by pulling it through the opening and laying the meat on top of the shell. Rinse tails under water; place in an oven-safe baking dish.
3. Combine melted butter, garlic powder, and parsley in a bowl. Mix together with a spoon.
4. Season lobster tails with seafood seasoning and pour melted butter mixture on top until each tail is completely covered. Squeeze lemon juice over top.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until shells are bright red and meat is opaque, 12 to 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the centers should read 140 to 145 degrees F (60 to 63 degrees C).
