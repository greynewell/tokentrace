## Ingredients

- 1 ½ pounds zucchini, sliced
- ½ cup olive oil, or more as needed
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic, or more to taste
- 1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti
- ½ cup grated aged provolone cheese
- ¾ cup chopped fresh basil
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Place zucchini slices on a plate and let dry for 1 hour.
2. Heat 1/2 cup oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add zucchini slices in batches and deep fry until brown, 10 to 15 minutes per batch. Drain on paper towels and allow to cool. Mash 1/3 of the zucchini.
3. Place 3 tablespoons olive oil and garlic cloves in a large saucepan over low heat. Watch carefully and simmer until garlic cloves are a light golden brown and oil is infused with garlic flavor, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir in mashed zucchini. Add zucchini slices.
4. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain spaghetti, reserving some cooking water.
5. Add spaghetti and provolone cheese to the saucepan. Toss and add hot pasta water until sauce becomes creamy. Mix in basil, season with salt and pepper, and serve.
