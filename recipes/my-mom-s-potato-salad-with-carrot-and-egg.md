## Ingredients

- 4  potatoes, peeled and cut into eighths
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1  cucumber, thinly sliced
- ½  onion, thinly sliced
- 1  carrot, thinly sliced into rounds
- 1 tablespoon apple juice
- ⅓ tablespoon rice vinegar
- 2  hard-boiled eggs, chopped
- 5 tablespoons mayonnaise

## Instructions

1. Soak potatoes in a bowl of water to draw out the bitterness.
2. Rub salt over cucumber and onion slices; squeeze out excess moisture and pat dry. Set aside.
3. Drain potatoes and place in a pot with carrot. Add enough water to cover. Season with salt. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer until potatoes can be easily pierced with a bamboo skewer, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove carrot from the pot when tender.
4. Drain potatoes and return to the pot. Add apple juice and vinegar; mash potatoes with a wooden spatula or fork for about 2 minutes.
5. Transfer potatoes to a bowl. Add cooked carrot, cucumber, onion, and eggs. Mix in mayonnaise. Season with salt and pepper. Refrigerate until cool, 30 minutes to 1 hour. Serve in individual bowls.
