## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 4 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ cup shortening
- 1 cup milk
- ⅓ cup butter, softened
- ¾ cup packed brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
- ½ cup raisins

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners.
2. In a large bowl, combine flour, baking powder and salt. Cut in shortening until mixture resembles coarse cornmeal. Add milk all at once to dry ingredients and stir with a fork until a soft dough is formed. Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface and knead gently 8 to 10 times. Roll out to a 12 inch square.
3. Gently spread butter over dough. Combine brown sugar, cinnamon and raisins. Sprinkle evenly on top of dough. Roll up dough lightly like a jelly-roll. Seal edge. Cut into twelve 1 inch thick pieces. Place in prepared muffin tins.
4. Bake in preheated oven for 14 to 18 minutes, until golden. Remove from heat immediately. Serve warm.
