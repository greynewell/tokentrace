## Ingredients

- 1 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour
- ¼ cup white sugar
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ⅛ teaspoon ground cardamom
- ½ cup unsalted butter, melted
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 ½ cups peeled and sliced fresh peaches
- 1 ½ cups fresh blueberries
- 2 ½ tablespoons honey
- 1 ½ teaspoons lemon juice
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- ¼ cup rolled oats
- ¼ cup firmly packed dark brown sugar
- ¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1 pinch salt
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom.
2. Mix flour, sugar, cinnamon, salt, nutmeg, and cardamom in a bowl for the crust. Add in melted butter and vanilla extract. Stir until mixture comes together into a soft dough.
3. Place dough in the prepared pan; press evenly over the bottom and up the sides. Use a fork to gently prick the bottom of the crust several times. Place the pan on a baking sheet.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until crust is just beginning to brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool.
5. Toss sliced peaches, blueberries, honey, and lemon juice together in a bowl until evenly coated. Pour filling into the cooled crust, slightly mounding the fruit in the middle.
6. Mix flour, oats, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt in a bowl until topping is combined. Stir in melted butter and vanilla extract until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Sprinkle topping evenly over the filling.
7. Return the tart to the oven and bake until topping is lightly browned and filling is bubbling, 37 to 42 minutes. Cool to room temperature before removing from the pan. Place tart in the refrigerator and cool completely before slicing.
