## Ingredients

- 3 cups water
- 3 cups rolled oats
- 1 tablespoon salt
- ⅔ cup brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons shortening
- 2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- ¼ cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
- 6 ½ cups bread flour

## Instructions

1. In a large saucepan, heat the water, oatmeal and salt until it bubbles.
2. Add the brown sugar and shortening; stir until melted.
3. Remove from heat and let cool until lukewarm.
4. In a small bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water.
5. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.
6. In a large bowl, combine the yeast mixture, oats mixture and 2 cups flour; stir well to combine.
7. Stir in the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, beating well after each addition.
8. When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.
9. Lightly oil a large bowl, place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil.
10. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
11. Deflate the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface.
12. Divide the dough into two equal pieces and form into loaves.
13. Place the loaves into two lightly greased 9x5 inch loaf pans.
14. Cover the loaves with a damp cloth and let rise until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes.
15. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
16. Bake in preheated oven for about 40 to 45 minutes or until loaf tops are golden brown and the bottom of a loaf sounds hollow when tapped.
