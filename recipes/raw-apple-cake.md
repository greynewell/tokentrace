## Ingredients

- ¾ cup vegetable oil
- 2  eggs
- 2 cups white sugar
- 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 3 cups chopped Granny Smith apples
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 2 teaspoons baking soda
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- 1 tablespoon milk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 pinch salt
- 2 ½ cups confectioners' sugar

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F(175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch baking pan.
2. Make the cake: Whisk oil and eggs together in a bowl. Place apples in a separate bowl, and pour oil-egg mixture over top. Let stand while mixing the dry ingredients.
3. Whisk together flour, sugar, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a separate bowl. Gradually fold flour mixture into apple mixture; mix until batter is thick but well combined. Pour into the prepared pan.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool completely.
5. While the cake is cooling, make the frosting: Beat cream cheese, 1 tablespoon milk, vanilla, and salt in a mixing bowl until well combined. Gradually beat in confectioners' sugar, then continue to beat until smooth. Beat in additional milk, if needed, 1 tablespoon at a time, until frosting is desired consistency.
6. Spread frosting over cooled cake.
