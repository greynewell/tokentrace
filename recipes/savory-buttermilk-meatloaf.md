## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1  yellow onion, diced
- 2 ½ pounds ground chuck
- 1 cup dry bread crumbs
- ¾ cup buttermilk
- ½ cup ketchup
- 2  eggs, beaten
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- 2 ½ teaspoons salt
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon hot sauce
- ½ teaspoon dried tarragon
- ½ teaspoon Italian seasoning
- ¼ cup brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- 1 teaspoon cider vinegar

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat.
2. Make the meatloaf: Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and sauté until soft and translucent, 6 to 7 minutes. Cool to room temperature, about 5 minutes.
3. Combine cooled onion, ground chuck, bread crumbs, buttermilk, ketchup, eggs, Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper, hot sauce, tarragon, and Italian seasoning in a bowl; mix together with a fork and let sit until bread crumbs absorb moisture, about 10 minutes.
4. Turn meatloaf mixture out into the center of the prepared baking sheet and form into a 9x5-inch loaf.
5. Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes.
6. While the meatloaf is baking, make the glaze: Whisk brown sugar, mustard, and vinegar together in a small bowl.
7. After 45 minutes, remove meatloaf from the oven and spread brown sugar glaze over top. Return to the oven and continue baking until no longer pink in the center, about 30 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
