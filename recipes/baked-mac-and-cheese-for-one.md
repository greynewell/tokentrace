## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons uncooked macaroni pasta
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1 pinch pepper
- ⅛ teaspoon onion powder
- ½ cup milk
- ⅓ cup shredded Cheddar cheese
- ⅛ teaspoon ground mustard
- 1 dash Worcestershire sauce
- 1 dash hot sauce
- 1 teaspoon bread crumbs
- 1 tablespoon shredded Cheddar cheese

## Instructions

1. Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease an oven-proof soup crock or 1 cup baking dish.
2. Fill a small saucepan with water, and bring to a boil. Stir in the macaroni; boil until cooked but still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well, and reserve.
3. In the same saucepan, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Stir in the flour, salt, pepper, onion powder, and milk; whisk until smooth. Cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low, and whisk in 1/3 cup cheese, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and hot sauce. Stir in the cooked macaroni. Spoon the macaroni and cheese into the prepared dish. Sprinkle with bread crumbs and 1 tablespoon cheddar cheese.
4. Bake, uncovered, until the cheese is melted and the macaroni is heated through, about 10 minutes.
