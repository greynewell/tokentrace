## Ingredients

- 1 ½ pounds cauliflower, cut into chunks
- 2 pounds ground beef
- 1 (16 ounce) can tomato sauce
- 3 medium bell peppers, diced
- ¼ cup shredded Cheddar cheese, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Place cauliflower in the bowl of a food processor; pulse until it resembles rice grains. Don't process too much or it will get mushy. Transfer to a dry skillet and heat over low heat to cook out any moisture.
2. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.
3. Add riced cauliflower, tomato sauce, and bell peppers to the meat; mix to combine. Transfer mixture to a casserole dish and sprinkle with Cheddar cheese.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 45 minutes to 1 hour.
