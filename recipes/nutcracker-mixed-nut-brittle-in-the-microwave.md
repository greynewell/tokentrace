## Ingredients

- 1  serving cooking spray
- 1 cup white sugar
- ½ cup light corn syrup
- 1 ½ cups mixed raw nut halves and pieces
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, or more as needed
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon coarse sea salt, or to taste  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Butter a 10x15-inch baking sheet or line with parchment paper.
2. Spray a heatproof spoon with cooking spray. Stir sugar and corn syrup together in a 2-quart microwave-safe bowl using the greased spoon. Microwave on high until very bubbly, 2 1/2 to 4 minutes.
