## Ingredients

- 2 pounds salmon, skinned and deboned
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1  lemon
- ½ tablespoon chopped fresh dill, or more to taste
- ½ tablespoon garlic powder, or more to taste
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper

## Instructions

1. Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
2. Rub salmon down in olive oil. Cut your lemon in half and set 1 half off to the side. Cut the other half into 1/4-inch thick slices. Lay them on a broiler pan and lay the salmon on top of them. You just need enough to cover the bottom of the salmon so it's not touching the pan. Sprinkle with dill, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Lightly squeeze the remainder of the lemon over the whole salmon; not too much, you don't want your seasoning to run off.
3. Cook in the center of the preheated oven on a low broil until easily flaked with a fork but still juicy, 15 to 20 minutes.
