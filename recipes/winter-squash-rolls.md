## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups cubed
- 1 cup scalded milk
- 2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
- ½ cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
- 6 cups all-purpose flour
- ½ cup white sugar
- 2 teaspoons salt
- ½ cup shortening

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). In a small saucepan, cover squash cubes with water. Bring to a boil and cook until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain; cool and mash.
2. In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. In a large bowl, combine 5 cups flour, sugar, and salt. Stir in yeast mixture, shortening, squash and milk; mix well. Stir in remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, beating well after each addition. When dough has pulled together, turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and supple, about 8 minutes. Lightly oil a large bowl, place dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
3. Divide dough into twelve equal pieces and form into rounds. Place the rounds in a lightly greased 13x9-inch baking pan. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
4. Bake rolls in the preheated oven for 10 to 15 minutes or until golden brown.
