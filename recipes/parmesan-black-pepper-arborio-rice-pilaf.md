## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 2 cups arborio rice, rinsed in a colander until water runs clear
- 1 quart low-sodium chicken broth
- ¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 teaspoon coarsely ground pepper
- Salt, to taste

## Instructions

1. Heat butter and oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onion; saute until softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Add rice; stir to coat. (Can turn off heat and let stand several hours.)
2. Add broth, cover, and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until stock is absorbed and rice is creamy and soft with a little "chew" at the center, about 12 minutes. Stir in cheese and pepper; add salt, if necessary. Serve hot.
