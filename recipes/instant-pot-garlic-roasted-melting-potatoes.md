## Ingredients

- ½ cup butter
- 1 pound Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch slices
- ¾ cup chicken broth
- 1 teaspoon ground thyme
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 2 cloves garlic, peeled and lightly crushed

## Instructions

1. Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot) and select the Sauté function. Melt butter in the pot. Add potato rounds in a single layer and cook in melted butter until golden, about 5 minutes. Flip and cook for 5 minutes more. Remove potatoes and set aside.
2. Place the trivet inside the pot. Pour in chicken broth, then season with thyme, salt, and pepper. Add garlic; cook for 1 minute. Place potatoes on the trivet; close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set the timer for 1 minute.
3. Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Remove potatoes from the pot.
4. Select Sauté function and cook chicken broth and butter mixture until slightly reduced, about 2 minutes. Place potatoes back into the pot in a single layer. Cook until golden, about 3 minutes per side.
