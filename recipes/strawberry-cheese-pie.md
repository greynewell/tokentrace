## Ingredients

- 1 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 4 tablespoons shortening
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 3 tablespoons cold water
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- ¾ cup confectioners' sugar

2. Roll dough between two sheets of wax paper into an 11 inch circle. Remove top sheet of wax paper and lay into 9 inch pie pan. Prick bottom and sides of pie shell thoroughly to prevent shrinkage.
