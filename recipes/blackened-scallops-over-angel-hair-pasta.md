## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon ground white pepper
- ¼ tablespoon salt
- ¾ teaspoon dry mustard
- ¾ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ⅛ teaspoon dried thyme leaves
- 1 pound scallops
- 2 tablespoons butter, or as needed
- ½  onion, chopped
- 1 cup mushrooms, sliced
- 1 (12 ounce) package angel hair pasta
- olive oil
- ½  tomato, chopped
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice

## Instructions

1. Mix black pepper, white pepper, salt, mustard, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, and thyme together. Dredge scallops in blackening spices.
2. Melt 1/2 of the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add mushrooms and cook until just tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate, cover, and set aside.
3. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook angel hair pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, melt remaining butter in the same skillet over medium heat. Add scallops in a single layer and sear until browned on the outsides and opaque in the centers, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Cover and set aside.
5. Drain pasta and place in a bowl. Drizzle with olive oil. Add the mushroom mixture and tomato. Serve pasta in individual bowls; place scallops on top and drizzle with lemon juice.
