## Ingredients

- 1 cup white sugar
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch
- ⅛ teaspoon salt
- 1 (20 ounce) can crushed pineapple, undrained
- 3  eggs, separated, divided
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- ¼ teaspoon cream of tartar
- 6 tablespoons white sugar
- 1 (9 inch) baked pastry shell

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Combine 1 cup sugar, cornstarch, and salt in a large saucepan. Stir in pineapple and juice until blended. Bring to a boil; cook and stir until thickened, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat.
3. Place egg yolks in a bowl and gradually stir in 1 cup of hot filling. Add to the mixture in the saucepan, stirring constantly. Bring to a gentle boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in lemon juice and keep warm.
4. Beat egg whites and cream of tartar for meringue in a bowl until soft peaks form. Beat in remaining 6 tablespoons sugar gradually, 1 tablespoon at a time, on high speed, until stiff peaks form.
5. Pour hot filling into the pastry shell. Spread meringue over the filling, sealing edges to crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until meringue is golden brown, about 15 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 1 hour; then refrigerate for at least 3 hours before cutting.
