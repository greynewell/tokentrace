## Ingredients

- 3 cups elbow macaroni
- 6 slices thick-cut bacon
- 2 (10.75 ounce) cans  condensed Cheddar cheese soup
- 1 ½ cups shredded Cheddar cheese
- 1 ¼ cups milk
- 12 ounces cooked lobster tail meat, chopped
- ⅔ cup panko bread crumbs
- ¼ cup butter, melted

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain.
2. Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on paper towels and dice.
3. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
