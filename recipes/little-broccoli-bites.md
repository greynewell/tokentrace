## Ingredients

- 2 (10 ounce) packages frozen chopped broccoli
- 6  eggs
- 2 tablespoons dried minced onion
- 1 teaspoon dried parsley
- ½ teaspoon poultry seasoning
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 2 cups dry bread crumbs
- ½ cup margarine, softened

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cook broccoli according to package directions. Drain, and cool.
