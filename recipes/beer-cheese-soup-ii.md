## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon margarine
- ½ cup chopped onion
- ½ teaspoon minced garlic
- 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle light beer
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth
- 3 tablespoons cornstarch
- 2 cups half-and-half
- 2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese

## Instructions

1. Melt the butter or margarine in a 4 1/2 quart soup pot over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic and Worcestershire sauce and stir well. Add the beer and raise the heat to high and boil for 3 minutes to evaporate the alcohol. Add the chicken broth and bring the soup back to a boil. Lower the heat to medium-low and simmer.
2. Combine the cornstarch with 3 tablespoons water and stir until smooth. Set aside.
3. Add the half-and-half and shredded cheese to the soup. Stir constantly until the cheese melts. Then stir in the cornstarch mixture. Stir constantly until the soup is thick, about 2 minutes. Serve garnished with bacon bits.
