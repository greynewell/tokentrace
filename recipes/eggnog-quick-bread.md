## Ingredients

- 2  eggs, beaten
- 1 cup eggnog
- 2 teaspoons rum flavored extract
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ½ cup butter, softened
- 2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease bottom only of a 9x5-inch loaf pan, or three 3x5-inch loaf pans.
2. Blend together the eggs, eggnog, rum extract, sugar, vanilla and butter.
