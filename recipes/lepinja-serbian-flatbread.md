## Ingredients

- 1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
- 2 tablespoons warm milk (110 to 115 degrees F)
- 1 cup warm water (110 to 115 degrees F)
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 2 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon salt

## Instructions

1. Sprinkle the yeast over the warm milk in a small bowl. Let stand for 5 minutes until the yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam. Stir the warm water and sugar into the yeast mixture.
2. Stir the flour and salt together in a separate bowl; add all but about 1/2 cup of the flour mixture to the yeast mixture; mix with your hands until a soft dough forms, adding the last of the flour mixture a little at a time until it clears the sides of the bowl. Cover the bowl with a light cloth and let the dough rise in a warm place (80 to 95 degrees F (27 to 35 degrees C)) until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
3. Deflate, or 'punch down,' the dough and turn out onto a work surface lightly dusted with flour; knead for about 5 minutes. Return the dough to the bowl, cover again with a light cloth, and allow the dough to again rise until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes more.
4. Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.
5. Deflate the dough and turn turn out onto a work surface lightly dusted with flour; knead lightly. Place the dough onto the prepared baking sheet; shape into an oval about 1/2-inch thick. Set aside to rise a third time for about 30 minutes.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until nicely browned and hollow sounding when thumped, 20 to 25 minutes.
