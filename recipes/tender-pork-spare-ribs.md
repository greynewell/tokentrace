## Ingredients

- 1 cup brown sugar
- ½ cup fajita seasoning (such as Fiesta®)
- 2 tablespoons Hungarian sweet paprika
- 2 racks pork spareribs, fat trimmed
- 1 cup beer
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tablespoon prepared brown mustard

## Instructions

1. Mix brown sugar, fajita seasoning, and paprika in a bowl. Rub both sides of pork spareribs with the brown sugar mixture. Place spareribs in a 9x13-inch baking pan; cover and refrigerate 8 hours or overnight.
2. Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Whisk together beer, garlic, honey, Worcestershire sauce, and mustard in a bowl. Set aside.
3. Tear off 2 large sheets of heavy-duty aluminum foil and lay them shiny-side down. Place a rack of spare ribs on each sheet, meaty-side up. Tear off 2 more sheets of foil and place them on top of the spare ribs, shiny-side up. Begin tightly folding the edges of the foil together to create a sealed packet. Just before sealing completely, divide beer mixture evenly into each packet. Complete the seal. Place the packets side-by-side on an 11x14-inch baking sheet.
4. Bake ribs in the preheated oven until the ribs are very tender, 3 1/2 to 4 hours. Carefully open each packet and drain drippings into a saucepan. You may only need the drippings from one packet. Place ribs on a foil-lined baking sheet and set aside.
5. Heat the saucepan over medium-high and simmer drippings until the sauce begins to thicken, about 5 minutes. Brush the thickened sauce over ribs.
6. Preheat the broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. Return ribs to the oven and broil until the sauce is lightly caramelized, 5 to 7 minutes.
