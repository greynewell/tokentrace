## Ingredients

- 8 slices stale bread
- ½ cup butter, softened
- ½ cup white sugar
- ½ cup dried currants
- 1 ¾ cups milk
- 2  eggs
- 1 pinch ground nutmeg

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch round pie dish or cake pan.
2. Butter bread on both sides and cut into triangles. Arrange a single layer of buttered bread in the bottom of the prepared pan, slightly overlapping the triangles.
3. Sprinkle with 1/2 of the sugar and 1/2 cup currants. Arrange remaining bread on top, then sprinkle with remaining sugar.
4. Beat milk, eggs, and nutmeg together in a bowl. Pour over bread and press down firmly to compress pudding and help bread absorb milk mixture.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and set, about 30 minutes.
