## Ingredients

- 1 cup raw cashews
- 1 cup cooked chickpeas, drained
- ¼ cup vegetable broth
- 1  fresh jalapeno pepper, seeded
- 2 tablespoons fresh squeezed lemon juice
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon miso paste
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 1 9-inch vegan pie crust
- 3 medium heirloom tomatoes
- 1 large fresh jalapeno chile
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- ¼ teaspoon flaky salt

## Instructions

1. Soak the cashews in water for at least 1 hour, up to 8 hours.
2. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
3. Drain cashews. Combine cashews, chickpeas, broth, seeded jalapeno, lemon juice, 1 tablespoon olive oil, garlic, miso paste, salt, and pepper in a blender; blend until smooth and creamy. Set aside to allow flavors to meld.
4. Put the pie crust into an 11-inch tart pan. (A 9-inch pie crust should be the right size because a tart pan is only about an inch shallow. If necessary, just roll out the pie crust a bit to stretch it out.)
5. Layer two pieces of foil over the pie crust. Fill it with beans or pie weights. Turn down the heat to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
6. Bake the pie crust in the preheated oven for 11 minutes. Remove from oven and take away foil and weights.
7. Brush pie crust with 1 teaspoon olive oil. Poke a few holes in it with a fork and continue baking for 6 minutes. Remove and let cool. Turn down the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
8. Cut tomatoes into 1/4 inch rounds. Remove the seeds. Cut the other jalapeno into rings.
9. Spread cashew mixture into the pre-baked pie crust. Layer tomato slices on top, overlapping if necessary. Place jalapeno rings over the pie. Drizzle remaining olive oil on top. Sprinkle with paprika and 1/4 teaspoon flaky salt.
10. Bake in the preheated oven until browned and tomatoes have begun to caramelize, 30 to 40 minutes. Cool before serving.
