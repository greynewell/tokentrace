## Ingredients

- 8 teaspoons olive oil, or as needed, divided
- 4 ounces chorizo sausage, casings removed and meat crumbled
- ½ cup diced green onion
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ½ cup cooked long-grain white rice
- 2 ounces goat cheese
- 1  large egg
- 3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided
- 2 cloves garlic, crushed
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1  blood orange, zested and juiced
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper, or more to taste
- 12  piquillo peppers
- 2 tablespoons chopped almonds

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Brush a baking dish with 1 tablespoon olive oil.
2. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Saute sausage, green onion, and a pinch of salt in hot oil until meat is browned and crumbly and onion is translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat and cool for 10 minutes.
3. Mix rice, goat cheese, egg, 2 tablespoons parsley, garlic, cumin, 1 teaspoon blood orange zest, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl. Spoon rice mixture into each pepper. Place stuffed peppers in a single layer in the prepared baking dish. Scatter almonds over the top, drizzle with 1 teaspoon olive oil, and sprinkle with salt.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until stuffed peppers are heated through and filling is hot, 15 to 20 minutes. Drizzle 1 tablespoon blood orange juice, remaining 1 teaspoon olive oil, and remaining parsley over the top.
