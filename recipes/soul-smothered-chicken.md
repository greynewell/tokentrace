## Ingredients

- ½ cup butter
- 1  whole chicken, cut into pieces
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ¾ cup all-purpose flour
- 3 cups chopped yellow onions
- 1 cup chopped celery
- 3 cloves garlic, chopped
- 2 cups chopped carrots
- 3 cups chicken broth
- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 2 teaspoons salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper

## Instructions

1. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Season chicken pieces with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.
2. Place 3/4 cup flour in a shallow dish. Dredge chicken in flour, place in the skillet, and brown on all sides. Set chicken aside, and drain skillet, reserving about 1 tablespoon butter.
3. Reduce skillet heat to medium-low, and stir in onions, carrots, celery, and garlic. Cook until tender, 5 minutes.
4. Stir in 3 tablespoons flour, and cook 5 minutes more. Pour in chicken broth, season with cayenne pepper, and remaining salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, and reduce heat to low.
