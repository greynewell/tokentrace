## Ingredients

- 1 (.25 ounce) envelope active dry yeast
- ¼ cup warm water
- 6 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 cup white sugar
- 3  eggs
- ¼ cup melted butter, cooled
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 ¼ cups milk

## Instructions

1. In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water with a pinch of the sugar. Set aside to ferment, about 10 minutes.
2. Transfer the yeast mixture to a large bowl, and stir in the sugar, eggs, salt, flour, and milk until the dough comes together. Stir in the melted butter, then turn the dough out onto a floured surface, and knead for about 10 minutes, or until smooth and elastic. Cover dough with a cloth and set aside to rise until doubled in bulk, about 45 minutes.
3. Divide dough into about 15 to 20 pieces, and shape them into flat round cakes about 1/2 inch thick. Place a cloth on the table and dust it with flour. Arrange the cakes on the cloth, allowing space for rising. Allow them to set for 1 1/2 hours.
4. Place the cakes in a heavy ungreased skillet, and cook over low heat. Fry the cakes on each side until golden.
