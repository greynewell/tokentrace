## Ingredients

- 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 3 tablespoons white sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup shortening
- 1  egg
- ¼ cup cold water
- 3 pounds fresh peaches - peeled, pitted, and sliced
- ¼ cup lemon juice
- ¾ cup orange juice
- ½ cup butter
- 2 cups white sugar
- ½ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 1 tablespoon butter, melted

## Instructions

1. Make crust: Sift together flour, 3 tablespoons sugar, and salt in a medium bowl. Work in shortening with a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Whisk together egg and cold water in a small bowl. Sprinkle over flour mixture; work with hands to form dough into a ball. Wrap with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
2. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
3. Roll out 1/2 of the chilled dough to 1/8-inch thickness. Place in a 9x13-inch baking dish, covering the bottom and halfway up the sides.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes.
5. Make filling: Mix peaches, orange juice, and lemon juice in a large saucepan. Add butter and cook over medium-low heat until butter is melted. Stir together sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a bowl; mix into peach mixture until combined. Pour into baked crust.
6. Roll remaining dough to 1/4-inch thickness. Cut into 1/2-inch-wide strips. Weave strips into a lattice over peaches. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon sugar, then drizzle with melted butter.
7. Bake in the preheated oven until top crust is golden brown, 35 to 40 minutes.
