## Ingredients

- 4 (8 ounce) skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- salt and pepper to taste
- 4 slices bacon, cut into 1/2 inch pieces
- ⅓ cup low-sodium chicken broth
- 4 ounces sliced mushrooms
- ¼ cup heavy whipping cream
- 2  green onions, white and green parts separated and sliced

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Season chicken thighs on all sides with paprika, salt, and pepper.
3. Cook bacon in a cast iron skillet or oven-safe pan over medium-high heat until browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from skillet and drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Drain and discard excess grease from the skillet.
4. Return the skillet to medium heat and cook chicken thighs, skin-side down, for 3 to 4 minutes. Flip chicken over and place the skillet in the preheated oven.
5. Bake until chicken thighs are no longer pink at the bone and juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove chicken to a plate and cover with foil to keep warm. Remove all but 2 tablespoons of drippings from the skillet.
6. Return the skillet to the stove over medium-high heat. Pour in chicken broth while whisking up brown bits from the bottom of the skillet. Add mushrooms and cook until soft, about 3 to 4 minutes. Pour in heavy whipping cream and whisk together until lightly simmering, then reduce heat to medium-low. Season with salt and pepper, if necessary.
7. Return chicken and any juices back into the skillet; top with bacon and green onions. Serve immediately, spooning sauce over chicken.
