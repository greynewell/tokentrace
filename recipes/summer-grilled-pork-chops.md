## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups lemon juice
- 1 ½ cups honey
- 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- ¼ teaspoon dried basil
- 4  center-cut pork chops, 1/2-inch thick
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Mix lemon juice, honey, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, and basil together in a bowl. Pour 1/2 of the marinade into a resealable plastic bag; place pork chops in the bag, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours (overnight is best). Refrigerate the remaining marinade for basting.
2. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
3. Remove chops from the bag and discard the used marinade. Sprinkle chops with salt and black pepper.
4. Grill chops on the preheated grill until browned and no longer pink inside, 20 to 25 minutes. Baste frequently with reserved marinade, being sure to let the mixture cook onto the chops. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the center of a chop should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
