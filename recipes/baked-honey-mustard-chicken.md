## Ingredients

- 6  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- salt and pepper to taste
- ½ cup honey
- ½ cup prepared mustard
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- ½ teaspoon dried parsley

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
2. Season chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Place in the prepared baking dish.
3. Combine honey, mustard, basil, paprika, and parsley in a small bowl; mix well. Pour 1/2 of the honey mustard mixture over chicken and brush to cover.

Continue baking until chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear, 10 to 15 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
