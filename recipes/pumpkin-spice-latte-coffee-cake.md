## Ingredients

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons instant espresso powder
- 1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 pinch salt
- ½ cup unsalted butter, cut into cubes
- 2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon instant espresso powder
- 2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ cup unsalted butter, softened
- 1 ¼ cups white sugar
- 3 large eggs, at room temperature
- 1 cup pumpkin puree
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- ½ cup strongly brewed coffee, cooled to room temperature
- ½ cup heavy cream, at room temperature

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch pan.
2. Prepare streusel topping by combining flour, dark brown sugar, espresso powder, cocoa powder, pumpkin pie spice, vanilla extract, and salt in a large bowl. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Set aside.
3. Prepare the cake batter by whisking flour, espresso powder, pumpkin pie spice, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together until thoroughly combined. Set aside.
4. Cream butter and white sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Mix in eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix in pumpkin puree and vanilla. Stir in 1/3 of the dry ingredients, mixing until just combined. Mix in 1/2 of the cooled coffee and 1/2 of the heavy cream, stirring until just combined. Continue alternating dry ingredients with the coffee and heavy cream, beginning and ending with dry ingredients, mixing until just combined.
5. Pour 1/2 of the cake batter into the prepared pan and spread into an even layer. Measure out 1 cup of the streusel mixture and sprinkle evenly over the batter. Carefully pour the remaining batter over the filling, and gently spread to completely cover. Sprinkle the remaining streusel mixture evenly over the top of the cake.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out with just a few moist crumbs, 55 to 60 minutes. Allow cake to cool completely before serving.
