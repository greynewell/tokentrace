## Ingredients

- 6 cups crumbled dry bread
- ½ cup chopped walnuts
- 1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
- 1 cup pumpkin puree

- ¼ cup rum
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon rum extract
- 1 cup heavy whipping cream, chilled

- 2 tablespoons amaretto liqueur

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x9x2-inch baking pan. Place a pan of water into the bottom of the oven to help keep the pudding moist.

4. Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean, about 1 hour.
