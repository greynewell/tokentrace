## Ingredients

- 1 cup butter, softened
- 1 cup brown sugar
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- ½ cup sliced blanched almonds
- ½ cup chopped red candied cherries
- 2 ounces white chocolate  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Line bottom and sides of an 11x7-inch glass baking pan with parchment paper; leave paper hanging over pan edges so that cookies can be lifted out after baking.
3. Beat butter and brown sugar together with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes.
4. Stir flour into butter mixture until crumbly; stir in almonds and cherries.
5. Press mixture evenly into the bottom of prepared pan.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden at edges, about 20 minutes.
7. Score with a sharp knife into bars while in the pan and still warm; allow cookies to cool about 30 minutes.
8. Lift cookies from pan and slice to separate along scored marks.
9. Melt white chocolate in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring after each melting, for 1 to 3 minutes (depending on your microwave).
10. Do not overheat or chocolate will scorch.
11. Drizzle melted white chocolate over cookies or dip half of each cookie into melted white chocolate.
