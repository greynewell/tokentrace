## Ingredients

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- ⅓ cup white sugar
- ½ teaspoon baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon baking soda
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1  egg
- ½ cup reduced-fat plain yogurt
- 2 tablespoons butter, melted
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 3 tablespoons brown sugar
- 1 cup fresh or frozen raspberries
- 1 tablespoon slivered almonds
- ¼ cup confectioners' sugar

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly coat an 8 inch round cake pan with nonstick cooking spray.
2. Sift together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg, yogurt, butter, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. Stir the egg mixture into the flour until well moistened. Toss the raspberries with the brown sugar in a small bowl.
