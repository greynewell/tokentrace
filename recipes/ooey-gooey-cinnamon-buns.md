## Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- 1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
- ½ cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
- ½ cup milk
- ¼ cup white sugar
- ¼ cup butter
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2  eggs, beaten
- 4 cups all-purpose flour
- ¾ cup butter
- ¾ cup brown sugar
- 1 cup chopped pecans, divided
- ¾ cup brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
- ¼ cup melted butter

## Instructions

1. Prepare dough: Pour water into a liquid measure. Add 1 teaspoon sugar and active dry yeast; stir until dissolved. Let stand until foamy, about 10 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, warm milk in a small saucepan over medium heat until it just starts to bubble around the edges; do not boil. Remove from the heat and stir in 1/4 cup sugar, 1/4 cup butter, and salt until melted. Let cool until lukewarm.
3. Lightly whisk 2 eggs in a large bowl. Add yeast mixture, lukewarm milk mixture, and 1 1/2 cups flour; stir until well combined. Mix in remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well after each addition, until dough comes together.
4. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth, silky, and elastic, about 8 minutes.
5. Place dough in an oiled bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
6. While the dough is rising, prepare glaze: Melt 3/4 cup butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add 3/4 cup brown sugar and whisk until smooth.
7. Grease a 9x13-inch pan. Pour glaze mixture into the pan; sprinkle 1/2 cup pecans over top.
8. Prepare filling ingredients: Place melted butter in a small bowl. Combine brown sugar, pecans, and cinnamon for filling in another bowl.
9. When the dough has doubled in size, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll into a 14x18-inch rectangle. Brush 1/2 of the melted butter over the dough, leaving a 1/2 inch border unbuttered. Sprinkle brown sugar mixture over top. Start at the long edge and roll the dough tightly, pinching the seams to seal. Brush remaining butter over the dough.
10. Cut dough into 15 equal rolls. Place rolls, cut-sides down, in the glaze in the prepared pan. Cover and let rise until double in size, about 1 hour.
11. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
12. Uncover and bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.
13. Let cool in pan for 3 minutes, then invert onto a serving platter so the glaze is on top. Scrape any remaining glaze from the pan onto the rolls.
