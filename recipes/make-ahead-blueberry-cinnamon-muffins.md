## Ingredients

- 3 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
- 4 teaspoons baking powder
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ¾ cup white sugar
- ½ cup firmly packed brown sugar
- ½ cup unsalted butter, melted and cooled
- 2 large eggs at room temperature
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- ½ teaspoon almond extract
- 1 cup milk, at room temperature
- 1 cup sour cream, at room temperature
- 2 cups fresh blueberries
- ¼ cup turbinado sugar, or as needed
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon

## Instructions

1. Whisk together flour, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, baking soda, and nutmeg in a bowl until well combined.
2. Whisk together white sugar, brown sugar, and melted butter in a second, larger bowl until well combined. Whisk in eggs, lemon juice, vanilla extract, and almond extract until thoroughly combined. Add in milk and sour cream and beat until mixture is smooth, and no lumps remain. Pour in dry ingredients and fold in a few times until just moistened; there should still be some clumps of dry flour. Sprinkle blueberries over the batter, and fold in until just incorporated. Batter will be lumpy, but should not have patches of dry flour remaining in it. Do not overmix.
3. Place batter in the refrigerator for 8 hours to overnight.
4. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease two 12-cup muffin tins and line with paper liners.
5. In a small bowl, stir together turbinado sugar and cinnamon.
6. Fill each muffin liner to the top with the batter. Sprinkle sugar and cinnamon mixture over the top of each muffin.
7. Bake in the preheated oven until muffins are golden and spring back lightly when touched, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool in the pan for a few minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
