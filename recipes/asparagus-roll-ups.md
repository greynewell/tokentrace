## Ingredients

- 6 slices bacon
- 24 spears fresh asparagus, trimmed
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- 2 tablespoons finely chopped chives
- 12 slices white bread, crusts removed
- 2 tablespoons butter, melted
- 3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese, divided

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Grease a baking sheet.
3. Place bacon in a large, deep skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate.
4. When bacon is cool, crumble and set aside in a bowl.
5. Place asparagus spears into a large skillet and pour in about 1 inch of water. Place over medium heat, cover the skillet, and simmer asparagus until bright green and slightly tender, about 5 minutes. Remove asparagus and set aside.
6. Place cream cheese and chives into the bowl with bacon and stir to evenly combine.
7. Roll each bread slice with a rolling pin on a work surface until the slices are thin and flat.
8. Spread cream cheese mixture evenly over each slice of bread.
9. Center 2 asparagus spears on a bread slice, and roll the slice around the asparagus into a tidy and compact cylinder. Place seam side down onto the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining ingredients.
10. Brush each roll with melted butter and sprinkle each with about 1 1/2 teaspoon Parmesan cheese.
11. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden brown and hot, 10 to 12 minutes.
