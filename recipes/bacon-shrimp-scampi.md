## Ingredients

- 8 slices bacon, cut into 1/4-inch pieces
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 3 cloves garlic, chopped
- ¼ cup white wine
- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- 1 ½ pounds uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
- ½ (16 ounce) package dry fettuccine pasta
- 1 tablespoon chopped parsley, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Place bacon in a 12-inch oven-safe skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until browned and crispy, 7 to 8 minutes. Remove bacon, leaving the drippings in the skillet.
3. Melt butter in the same skillet and add chopped garlic. Cook and stir until garlic is fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour in white wine and cook for about 2 minutes. Stir in mustard until well combined.
4. Remove from heat, add shrimp in a single layer, and bake in the preheated oven until the shrimp are curled, pink, and no longer translucent, 10 to 12 minutes.
5. Meanwhile, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Cook fettuccine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.
6. Serve cooked shrimp over pasta, sprinkle with bacon pieces, and garnish with parsley.
