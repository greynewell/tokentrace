## Ingredients

- 1 cup milk
- 2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt

## Instructions

1. Stir the milk and vinegar together, and allow to stand until curdled, about 10 minutes.
2. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet. In a bowl, mix together the flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt.
3. Gradually stir the soured milk into the flour mixture until the dough just comes together, and turn the dough out onto a well-floured surface. Knead a few times, and shape into a round. Place the dough onto the prepared baking sheet. With a sharp knife, cut an X shape into the top of the dough to release steam and help the bread keep its round shape.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 45 minutes.
