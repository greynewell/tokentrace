## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1  onion, chopped
- 1  egg
- 1 ½ pounds lean ground beef
- ½ cup bread crumbs
- ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon minced garlic
- 1 pinch parsley flakes, or to taste
- 1 (8 ounce) package refrigerated crescent rolls
- 1  egg
- 1 tablespoon water

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until softened, about 5 minutes.
3. Beat 1 egg in a large bowl until foamy. Add onion, ground beef, bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, salt, pepper, and garlic; mix until combined. Mold mixture into a loaf on a baking sheet.
4. Unroll crescent rolls and use to cover meatloaf completely, seaming seals and perforations so that no meat is visible.
5. Whisk remaining egg and water in a small bowl to make egg wash. Brush egg wash over crust.
6. Bake meatloaf in the preheated oven until crust is very dark and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), about 45 minutes.
