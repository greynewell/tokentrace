## Ingredients

- 2 (8 ounce) sea bass fillets
- 1 pinch seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®), or to taste
- 1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
- 6 ounces pineapple juice
- ¼ cup dry white wine
- ¼ cup chicken stock
- 8 ounces heavy cream
- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Pat fish dry with paper towels and lightly season with seafood seasoning.
3. Coat an ovenproof skillet with oil and heat over medium-high heat until oil begins to shimmer but not smoke, about 1 minute. Place seasoned fish in the hot skillet and cook until lightly brown on 1 side, 4 to 5 minutes.
4. Turn fish over and place skillet in the preheated oven. Roast until fish flakes easily with a fork, 7 to 9 minutes. Transfer fish to a plate and cover tightly with aluminum foil.
5. Drain any excess oil from the skillet and return to the stove over medium-high heat. Add pineapple juice and scrape the bottom of the pan to release any browned bits. Add wine, chicken stock, and cream. Simmer until as thick as desired, 1 to 3 minutes. Remove skillet from heat, add mustard and butter. Whisk until melted and smooth. Serve sauce over roasted sea bass.
