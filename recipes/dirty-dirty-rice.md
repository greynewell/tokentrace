## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 6 ounces boneless pork shoulder, diced
- 1  yellow onion, diced
- ½ cup diced celery
- ½ cup diced green bell pepper
- 1 tablespoon paprika
- 2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
- ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ¼ teaspoon dried oregano
- ¼ teaspoon dried thyme
- 1  andouille sausage, diced, or to taste
- 8 ounces chicken livers, minced
- 2 cups long-grain rice
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt, or to taste
- 4 cups chicken broth
- 1  bay leaf
- 1 dash Worcestershire sauce
- ¼ cup sliced green onions
- ¼ cup chopped Italian parsley

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a high-sided pan over medium-high heat. Cook and stir pork until well browned and fat is rendered, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion, celery, and bell pepper; saute until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in paprika, cumin, black pepper, cayenne, garlic powder, oregano, and thyme. Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables continue to soften, about 5 minutes.
2. Reduce heat to medium and add andouille sausage. Cook and stir to release some flavor, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in chicken livers and rice until well coated. Season with salt, pour in broth, and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Add bay leaf and Worcestershire sauce. Cover tightly; reduce heat to medium-low. Cook, without stirring, until most of the liquid is absorbed and rice is starting to get tender, about 25 minutes.
3. Add green onions and parsley; mix well. Continue cooking over low to medium-low heat until rice is tender, about 10 minutes more. Taste for seasoning and remove bay leaf before serving.
