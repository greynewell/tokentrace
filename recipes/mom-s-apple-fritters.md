## Ingredients

- 1 quart vegetable oil for deep-frying
- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ⅔ cup milk
- 2  eggs, beaten
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 3 cups apples - peeled, cored and chopped

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a deep fryer or electric skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Stir together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Pour in milk, eggs, and oil; stir until well blended. Mix in apples until evenly distributed.
