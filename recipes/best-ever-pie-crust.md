## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup shortening
- ½ cup water

## Instructions

1. Whisk together flour and salt in a large bowl. Cut in chilled shortening with a pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse, pea-sized crumbs.
2. Add 1/4 cup ice-cold water; use a fork to stir the flour up from the bottom, just until it's mixed in. Press down on any chunks and continue working the dough around the bowl. Continue to add ice-cold water, in 1 tablespoon increments, mixing just until dough is moist enough to hold together when molded; you will not need more than 4 tablespoons and in fact, may need less. Do not add too much water!
3. Gently gather dough together into a ball. Divide in half, and flatten each half into a 1-inch-thick disc. Wrap each disc in plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. For best results, chill for 4 hours, or up to 2 days.
4. When ready to use, roll dough on a lightly floured surface, being careful not to overwork it.
5. Fit dough into a pie plate. If it crumbles or tears as you work it, just pinch and press it back into shape.
6. Use as directed in your pie recipe.
