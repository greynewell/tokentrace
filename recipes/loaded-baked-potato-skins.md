## Ingredients

- 4 large baking potatoes, scrubbed
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon garlic powder
- ¼ teaspoon ground paprika
- ⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 ½ cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
- 8 slices cooked bacon, crumbled
- ½ cup sour cream
- 4 stalks green onion, sliced

## Instructions

1. Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Prick potatoes several times with a fork and place onto a baking sheet.
2. Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are easily pierced with a fork, 50 minutes to 1 hour. Remove from the oven.
3. When potatoes are cool enough to handle, cut them lengthwise and scoop out flesh to within 1/4 inch of skin. Reserve flesh for another use. Place skins back onto the baking sheet.
4. Combine olive oil, Parmesan cheese, salt, garlic powder, paprika, and pepper in a small bowl; brush over both sides of skins.
5. Return to the oven and bake until very crisp, about 10 minutes, turning skins halfway though.
6. Sprinkle skins with Cheddar cheese and bacon. Return to the oven and bake until cheese is melted, about 2 more minutes.
7. Serve topped with sour cream and green onions.
