## Ingredients

- 1 pound fresh green beans, trimmed and snapped
- 1 tablespoon butter
- ¼ cup heavy cream
- 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
- ground nutmeg
- salt, to taste

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly-salted water to a boil; drop in the green beans and return to a boil. Cook uncovered until the beans are bright green and barely tender, about 6 minutes. Drain and set aside.
