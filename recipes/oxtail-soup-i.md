## Ingredients

- 3 pounds beef oxtail
- 3 teaspoons salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1  onion, chopped
- 2  carrots, sliced
- 1  parsnip, sliced
- 1  turnip, peeled and diced
- 2 tablespoons brandy  (Optional)
- 6 cups water
- ½ teaspoon dried savory
- 1  bay leaf
- ½ cup barley
- 2 ounces dried mushrooms

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
2. Trim off fat from oxtails. Spread on a shallow roasting pan.
3. Roast oxtails in the preheated oven for 45 minutes.
4. While oxtails are roasting, rehydrate dried mushrooms in hot water in a small bowl for 30 to 45 minutes. Drain, slice, and set aside.
5. Transfer roasted oxtails to a plate and set aside. Drain fat from the roasting pan, reserving about 2 tablespoons. Add 1 cup water to the roasting pan. Warm over medium heat, stirring constantly, to dissolve browned bits. Set aside.
6. Add reserved fat to a large stockpot over medium-high heat. Sauté onion, carrots, parsnip, turnip, and mushrooms in fat until soft, about 10 minutes. Add browned oxtails. Drizzle brandy on top. Ignite.
7. Pour reserved water and browning over oxtails and vegetables. Add remaining 5 cups water. Add barley, salt, savory, pepper, and bay leaf. Bring to boil, then reduce heat. Cover and simmer for 2 hours. Adjust seasonings.
