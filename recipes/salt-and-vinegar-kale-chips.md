## Ingredients

- 1 bunch kale
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 tablespoon malt vinegar
- ¼ teaspoon salt

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
2. Wash kale and tear leaves away from the ribs. Dry kale leaves completely and discard ribs.
3. Whisk olive oil, vinegar, and salt together in a large bowl. Gently stir in kale "chips" until evenly coated. Let sit for 5 minutes for flavors to absorb.
4. Divide kale evenly and spread on the prepared baking sheets, making sure no pieces overlap.
5. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Use tongs to carefully flip each chip over and bake until crispy, about 5 minutes longer. Transfer chips that are done to a paper towel. Bake any larger chips that were not done in 2 minute intervals until desired doneness.
