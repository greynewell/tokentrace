## Ingredients

- 1 pound dry pinto beans
- 8 cups water
- 1  large, meaty ham hock
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon chili powder
- 1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Place the beans and water in a large stockpot. Add the ham hock, onion and garlic. Season with chili powder, salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, and cook for 2 minutes. Cover, and remove from heat. Let stand for one hour.
2. Return the pot to the heat, and bring to a boil once again. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for at least 3 hours to blend flavors. The longer you simmer, the thicker the broth will become. I like to cook mine for about 6 hours.
3. Remove the ham hock from the broth, and let cool. Remove the meat from the bone, and return the meat to the stockpot, discarding the bone. Adjust seasonings to taste.
