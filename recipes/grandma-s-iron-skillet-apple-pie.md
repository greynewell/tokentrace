## Ingredients

- ½ cup butter
- 1 cup brown sugar
- 5  Granny Smith apples -- peeled, cored, quartered, and thinly sliced
- 3 (9 inch) refrigerated prerolled pie crusts
- 1 cup white sugar, divided
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon, divided
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 1 tablespoon butter, cut into small chunks

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Place 1/2 cup butter into a heavy cast iron skillet; place the skillet in the preheated oven until butter is melted. Remove the skillet and sprinkle with brown sugar; return to the oven to heat while you prepare the apples.
3. Remove the skillet from the oven; arrange 1 refrigerated pie crust on top of brown sugar. Top pie crust with 1/2 of the sliced apples. Sprinkle 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon on top. Place second pie crust over apples; top second crust with remaining apples and sprinkle with 1/2 cup sugar and 1 teaspoon cinnamon. Top with third crust; sprinkle with 1/4 cup sugar and dot with 1 tablespoon of butter. Cut 4 slits into the top crust for steam to escape.
