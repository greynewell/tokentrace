## Ingredients

- ⅓ cup dried porcini mushrooms
- 1 cup warm water
- 2 ½ pounds trimmed beef tenderloin roast, tied
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
- ½ cup sliced shallots
- 1 pinch salt
- ¼ cup tarragon vinegar
- 1 cup veal stock
- ¼ cup heavy cream
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh tarragon
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Combine porcini mushrooms and water in a bowl; soak until soft, 1 hour. Drain and reserve liquid. Dice and set mushrooms and reserved liquid aside.
2. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
3. Season beef generously with salt and pepper. Heat vegetable oil in a large ovenproof skillet over high heat. Place beef in the skillet; cook until brown on all sides, 5 to 8 minutes per side.
4. Reduce heat to medium and stir in 1 tablespoon butter, shallots, and a pinch of salt; cook until shallots are soft and translucent, 5 to 7 minutes.
5. Pour tarragon vinegar into the skillet and bring to a boil while scraping any browned bits off of the bottom. Stir until liquid is reduced by half, 2 to 4 minutes.
6. Pour in veal stock, cream, 1/2 cup reserved mushroom liquid, mushrooms, salt, and pepper; stir to combine. Return beef to the skillet.
7. Roast in the preheated oven until meat is medium rare, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C). Transfer meat to a plate and loosely tent with foil. Set skillet over high heat and bring pan juices to a boil.
8. Stir in 1 tablespoon butter and tarragon; season with salt and pepper to taste. Return tenderloin and any accumulated juices to skillet and serve.
