## Ingredients

- 2 quarts corn oil for frying
- ¼ cup milk
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- ¾ cup beer
- ½ teaspoon salt

- 2 pounds cheese curds, broken apart

## Instructions

1. Heat corn oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Whisk together flour, beer, milk, eggs, and salt to form a smooth, rather thin batter.
3. Place cheese curds, about 6 or 8 at a time, into the batter, stir to coat, and remove with a wire strainer. Shake the curds a time or two to remove excess batter.
