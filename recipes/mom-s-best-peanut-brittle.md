## Ingredients

- 1 cup white sugar
- ½ cup light corn syrup
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ cup water
- 1 cup peanuts
- 2 tablespoons butter, softened
- 1 teaspoon baking soda

## Instructions

1. Have all ingredients measured out before starting.
2. Grease a large rimmed baking sheet. Set aside.
3. Combine sugar, corn syrup, water, and salt in a heavy, 2-quart saucepan over medium heat. Stir until sugar is dissolved and the mixture comes to a boil, about 5 minutes.
4. Stir in peanuts and set a candy thermometer in place. Continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until the temperature reaches 300 to 310 degrees F (150 to 155 degrees C)
5. Remove from the heat. Quickly stir in butter and baking soda, then immediately pour mixture onto the prepared baking sheet. Quickly use 2 forks to lift and pull the mixture into a 12x14-inch rectangle. Let cool until completely firm, at least 30 minutes.
6. Use a mallet to break peanut brittle into pieces.
