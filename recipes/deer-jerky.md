## Ingredients

- 1 pound boneless venison roast
- 4 tablespoons soy sauce
- 4 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
- 2 tablespoons liquid smoke flavoring
- 1 tablespoon ketchup
- ¼ teaspoon pepper
- ¼ teaspoon garlic powder
- ¼ teaspoon onion salt
- ½ teaspoon salt

## Instructions

1. Combine soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, liquid smoke, ketchup, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion salt in a large releasable plastic bag; set aside.
2. Slice venison into long strips, 1-inch wide and 1/8-inch thick. Add strips to marinade and seal the bag. Refrigerate 8 hours to overnight, kneading occasionally to evenly distribute marinade.
