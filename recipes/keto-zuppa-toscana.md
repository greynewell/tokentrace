## Ingredients

- 1 pound mild Italian sausage
- 1 ¼ teaspoons red pepper flakes
- 4 slices bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
- 1 large onion, diced
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic
- 5 (13.75 ounce) cans low-sodium chicken broth
- 1 cup cauliflower florets
- 1 cup heavy cream
- ¼ bunch spinach, tough stems removed

## Instructions

1. Heat a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add sausage and red pepper flakes; cook until crumbly, browned, and no longer pink, about 10 minutes. Drain excess grease and transfer sausage to a bowl.
2. Reduce heat to medium and cook bacon in the same pot until crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain, leaving a few tablespoons of drippings in the pot. Stir in onions and garlic; cook until onions are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Pour in chicken broth; bring to a boil. Add cauliflower and boil until fork-tender, about 20 minutes.
3. Reduce heat to medium. Stir in heavy cream and the cooked sausage; heat through. Mix spinach into the soup just before serving.
