## Ingredients

- ½ cup flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon pepper
- 2 teaspoons chopped fresh parsley
- 1  whole chicken
- ¼ cup oil
- 3  eggs
- 1 ½ cups milk
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
- 1 cup flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt

## Instructions

1. Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Shake 1/2 cup of flour, 1 teaspoon salt, the pepper, and 2 teaspoons of parsley in a large plastic bag.
3. Add the chicken, and toss to coat all over with the flour mixture.
4. Remove the chicken, and shake to remove the excess flour.
5. Place, breast side up, into a small, lidded roasting pan that is slightly larger than the chicken.
6. Drizzle the oil evenly over the chicken, allowing the excess to coat the bottom of the roasting pan.
7. Cover, and bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour.
8. After the chicken has roasted for 1 hour, prepare the Yorkshire pudding batter by whisking together the eggs, milk, and 1 tablespoon of parsley until blended.
9. Add 1 cup of flour, the baking powder, and 1 teaspoon of salt; whisk until a smooth batter has formed.
10. Remove the roasting pan from the oven and place onto a baking sheet.
11. Pour the Yorkshire pudding batter evenly over the top of the chicken, allowing the excess to run into oil at the bottom of the pan.
12. Return to the oven, and bake until the Yorkshire pudding is puffed and golden brown, and the chicken is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 20 to 30 minutes.
13. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 180 degrees F (82 degrees C).
