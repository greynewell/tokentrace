## Ingredients

- 6 pounds onions, sliced
- 4 slices bacon
- 1 (16 ounce) container sour cream
- 4  egg
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon caraway seed
- 2 recipes pastry for a 9 inch single crust pie

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a jelly-roll pan or large pizza pan with prepared dough, making sure dough extends up sides of pan.
2. Saute onion in a skillet until translucent and pour cooked onion into a large mixing bowl. Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, chop and add to onion; mix well.
