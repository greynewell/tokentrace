## Ingredients

- 1 pound chicken tenders
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1  shallot, minced
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- ½ cup red wine
- ¼ cup balsamic vinegar
- 4  fresh figs, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
- 1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme leaves
- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- 1 teaspoon honey
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon butter

## Instructions

1. Season chicken with salt and pepper on both sides and lightly coat with flour, shaking off excess.
2. Heat olive oil and butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add chicken to the skillet and cook until tenders are golden brown, no longer pink in the centers, and juices run clear, 5 to 6 minutes, flipping halfway through. Transfer to a plate and cover loosely with aluminum foil to keep warm.
3. Add shallot and garlic to the same skillet and cook until softened, about 2 minutes. Add red wine and balsamic and let simmer until reduced by half, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in figs, thyme, Dijon mustard, honey, and salt; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low or medium-low and let simmer until thickened, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in butter.
4. Spoon sauce over warm chicken tenders, or add chicken back into the skillet to briefly reheat, and serve immediately.
