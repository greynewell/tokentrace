## Ingredients

- 2 large tomatoes
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic, crushed
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 4 large basil leaves, chopped

## Instructions

1. Bring a pot of water to a boil. Cook tomatoes in boiling water until skins begin to split, about 1 minute. Immediately remove tomatoes and plunge into ice water for several minutes to stop the cooking process. Remove tomatoes from ice water; remove and discard tomato skins. Cut tomatoes into chunks. Blend tomatoes in a food processor until smooth.
2. Heat oil in a saucepan over medium heat; cook garlic in oil until fragrant, being careful not to brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Add blended tomatoes and salt; bring the mixture to a simmer and cook until the sauce thickens, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the sauce from the heat and stir in basil. Allow the sauce to sit for a few minutes to allow basil flavor to blend into the sauce.
