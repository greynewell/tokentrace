## Ingredients

- 1 pound lean ground beef
- ⅓ cup dry bread crumbs
- ¼ cup chopped onions
- 1  egg, beaten
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 2 cups beef broth
- 1 large onion, thinly sliced
- 1 cup sliced mushrooms
- 3 tablespoons cornstarch
- 3 tablespoons water

## Instructions

1. Combine ground beef, bread crumbs, chopped onion, egg, salt, and black pepper in a large bowl until evenly mixed. Shape beef mixture into 4 patties, about 3/4-inch thick.
2. Fry patties in a large skillet over medium heat until browned on both sides, about 10 minutes. Add beef broth, onion, and mushrooms; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until patties are no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes more. Transfer patties to a platter and keep warm.
3. Bring onion mixture to a boil. Mix cornstarch and water in a small bowl; stir into onion mixture. Cook and stir until onion gravy is thickened, about 1 minute. Pour over patties to serve.
