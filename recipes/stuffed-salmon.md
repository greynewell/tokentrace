## Ingredients

- 2 teaspoons olive oil, divided, or as needed
- ¼ cup chopped onion, or more to taste
- ½ (8 ounce) package cream cheese
- ¼ cup crumbled blue cheese
- 1 cup chopped fresh spinach
- 1 tablespoon dry bread crumbs
- 1 clove garlic, minced, or to taste
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 (8 ounce) salmon fillet
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Heat 1 teaspoon oil in a skillet over medium heat; stir in onion. Cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and transfer to a bowl.
2. Combine cream cheese and blue cheese in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat on high for 25 seconds.
3. Add cheese mixture, spinach, bread crumbs, garlic, salt, and pepper to the onions; mix until well combined. Put stuffing in the freezer until chilled, 15 to 20 minutes.
4. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking dish with parchment paper.
5. Cut salmon into 2 portions. Slice each portion in half, leaving a connecting point at one side.
6. Heat remaining oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add salmon and fry until colored a bit, about 15 seconds per side. Transfer salmon to the prepared baking dish.
7. Take stuffing out of the freezer and make into 2 balls. Put 1 ball into each salmon portion.
8. Bake in the preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, 15 to 17 minutes. Garnish with lemon juice.
