## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon butter, or as needed
- 4  eggs, at room temperature
- ¾ cup white sugar
- ¼ cup white rum
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
- 1 ½ cups eggnog, at room temperature
- 3 tablespoons white rum

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat an 11x7-inch baking pan with butter.
2. Beat eggs in a bowl until frothy. Add sugar and continue to beat until thick and creamy, 4 to 5 minutes. Add rum and vanilla extract. Add flour, baking powder, and salt and mix until just combined; do not overbeat. Pour batter into the prepared baking pan.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 20 to 23 minutes. Allow to cool.
