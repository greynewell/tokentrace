## Ingredients

- 1 pound ground beef chuck (80% lean)
- 1 pound boneless lamb chops, cubed
- 1 cup minced onion
- 4 teaspoons minced garlic
- 1 teaspoon ground marjoram
- 1 ½ teaspoons ground rosemary
- 2 teaspoons sea salt
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper

## Instructions

1. Grind the ground chuck and lamb cubes through the coarse plate of a meat grinder twice to mix thoroughly.
2. Place the onion, garlic, marjoram, rosemary, salt, and pepper into a food processor, and pulse until finely ground.
3. Mix together the ground meat and onion mixture in a bowl.
4. Regrind through a fine plate, and pack the mixture into a 3x7 inch loaf pan.
5. Wrap tightly with plastic wrap, and refrigerate overnight.
6. Preheat an oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
7. Remove and discard the plastic wrap from the loaf pan, and bake the gyro meat in the preheated oven until the internal temperature reaches 140 degrees F (60 degrees C), about 1 hour.
8. Drain away all of the liquid that has accumulated in the pan, then remove the loaf from the pan.
9. Place the meat on a rack set above a baking dish to catch the drips, and continue baking until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F (75 degrees C), 15 to 30 minutes more.
10. Remove from the oven, and allow to stand 15 minutes before slicing.
11. The finished loaf should be firm and somewhat dry.
