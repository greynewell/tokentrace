## Ingredients

- 3 ½ teaspoons olive oil
- 2 ⅓ cups finely chopped onions
- 1 slice whole wheat bread, chopped into crumbs
- 4 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
- 1 ½ tablespoons Dijon mustard
- 4 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- 1 ¾ teaspoons poultry seasoning
- 1 teaspoon ground mustard
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 pinch salt
- 3 ½ pounds lean ground turkey
- nonstick cooking spray

## Instructions

1. Heat olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onions in the hot oil until tender and lightly browned, about 15 minutes; transfer to a large bowl.
2. Add bread crumbs, Worcestershire sauce, Dijon mustard, garlic, poultry seasoning, ground mustard, pepper, and salt to onions in the bowl; mix well. Add ground turkey, broken up into smaller pieces; mix everything together until evenly combined. Shape turkey mixture into 12 patties; wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 20 minutes.
3. Coat a nonstick skillet with cooking spray; heat over medium heat.
4. Cook patties in the hot skillet until no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, 4 to 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
