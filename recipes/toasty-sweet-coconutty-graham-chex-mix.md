## Ingredients

- 1 (14 ounce) package sweetened shredded coconut
- 2 (6 ounce) packages slivered almonds
- 1 (14 ounce) box crispy rice cereal squares (such as Rice Chex®)
- 1 (12 ounce) box honey graham cereal (such as Golden Grahams®)
- 2 cups white sugar
- 2 cups corn syrup
- 1 ½ cups butter

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Spread coconut out on a baking sheet. Spread almonds onto a separate baking sheet.
3. Bake coconut and almonds in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Remove baking sheets from oven and stir; continue cooking, stirring every 4 to 5 minutes, until coconut and almonds are golden brown, 5 to 10 minutes.
4. Combine coconut, almonds, rice cereal squares, and honey graham cereal together in a large bowl.
5. Bring white sugar, corn syrup, and butter to a boil in a saucepan. Heat to 240 degrees F (115 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a soft ball that flattens when removed from the water and placed on a flat surface, about 10 minutes.
6. Pour sugar mixture over cereal mixture and stir until well coated. Pour mixture out onto 2 baking sheets to cool, stirring occasionally to prevent clumping.
