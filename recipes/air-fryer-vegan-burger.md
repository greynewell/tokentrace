## Ingredients

- 1 (12 ounce) package meatless vegetarian ground beef
- nonstick cooking spray
- 1 ½ teaspoons steak seasoning (such as McCormick®)

## Instructions

1. Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) according to manufacturer's instructions.
2. Slice burger block into 3 equal pieces; form each piece into a patty.
3. Spray the top of one patty with nonstick spray and sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon seasoning on top. Flip over, place in the air fryer basket, and spray and season the other side.
4. Cook in the preheated air fryer for 3 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook until done, about 3 minutes longer. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 to 165 degrees F (70 to 74 degrees C). Repeat to season and cook remaining burgers.
