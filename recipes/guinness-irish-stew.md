## Ingredients

- 4 pounds boneless beef chuck roast, cut into 11/2-inch cubes
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- 2 pinches salt and ground black pepper, or to taste
- 2 pinches cayenne pepper
- ¼ cup vegetable oil
- 2  yellow onions, chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, crushed
- ¼ cup tomato paste
- 1 teaspoon water, or as needed
- 3 cups Irish stout beer (such as Guinness®), divided
- 2 sprigs fresh thyme
- 4 large potatoes, chopped
- 2 cups chopped carrot
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

## Instructions

1. Toss beef cubes with 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a bowl.
2. Whisk flour, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper in a separate bowl. Dredge beef cubes through flour mixture until evenly coated.
3. Heat 1/4 cup vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir coated beef cubes, working in batches, until beef is browned on all sides, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer browned beef to a Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot.
4. Cook and stir onions and garlic in the same skillet used for browning beef until lightly browned, 5 to 10 minutes.
5. Stir tomato paste with enough water to partially dilute; pour into onion mixture. Stir to blend. Reduce heat to medium, cover Dutch oven, and simmer for 5 minutes.
6. Pour half the Irish stout into the onion mixture, and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Transfer entire mixture to the browned beef. Pour remaining half of Irish stout into beef mixture; add thyme.
7. Cover Dutch oven, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 2 hours. Add potatoes and carrots and simmer, stirring every 20 minutes, until potatoes are soft, about 1 hour. Adjust salt as needed; garnish with parsley.
