## Ingredients

- 2  lemons, divided
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- ¾ teaspoon baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon baking soda
- 1 pinch salt
- 2 ½ cups white sugar
- 3 large eggs
- 1 ½ cups extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 ½ cups milk
- 1 cup sweetened flaked coconut
- 1 pint fresh raspberries
- 3 tablespoons white sugar

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch pan.
2. Zest 2 lemons into a small bowl. Juice 1 of the lemons into another small bowl. Reserve remaining lemon for another use.
3. Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl.
4. Whisk sugar and eggs together in another bowl until they form a ribbon. Stir olive oil, milk, lemon zest, and 1/2 of the lemon juice into the sugar-egg mixture until thoroughly combined. Fold in dry ingredients and coconut, then pour into the prepared pan.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes. Remove cake and let cool completely, 20 to 30 minutes.
6. While cake is baking, place raspberries, sugar, and remaining lemon juice in a small saucepan. Heat over medium-high heat and stir until raspberries break down and mixture has thickened and is starting to boil, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat and place in a serving container.
7. Cut cake into pieces and spoon or pour some of the sauce over top.
