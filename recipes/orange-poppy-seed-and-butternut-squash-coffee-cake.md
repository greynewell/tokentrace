## Ingredients

- ½ cup all-purpose flour
- ½ cup firmly packed brown sugar
- ¾ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 pinch salt
- 1 pinch ground cloves
- 1 pinch ground nutmeg
- 6 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into cubes
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¾ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ¼ teaspoon ground cloves
- ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1 cup white sugar
- ½ cup unsalted butter, softened
- 2 large eggs, at room temperature
- 1 cup mashed, cooked butternut squash
- ¼ cup freshly squeezed orange juice
- 1 ½ tablespoons grated orange zest
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ½ cup buttermilk, at room temperature
- 1 tablespoon poppy seeds

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch springform pan with removable bottom.
2. Mix flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, salt, cloves, and nutmeg together in a bowl until well combined. Cut in butter until streusel forms coarse, large crumbs. Set aside.
3. Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg until combined. Set aside.
4. Cream sugar and butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Mix butternut squash, orange juice, orange zest, and vanilla extract until combined. Mix in 1/2 of the dry ingredients until just combined. Pour in buttermilk, mixing until just combined. Stir in remaining dry ingredients until just incorporated. Fold in poppy seeds.
5. Pour batter into the prepared pan and spread into an even layer. Sprinkle streusel mixture evenly over the top of the batter.
6. Set springform onto a baking sheet, and place into the preheated oven. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 55 to 60 minutes. Remove from oven and cool for 20 minutes before removing the sides of the pan. Serve slightly warm, or cool to room temperature.
