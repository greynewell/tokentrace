## Ingredients

- 1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 ½ teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¾ cup milk
- ⅓ cup shortening
- 1  egg
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ⅓ cup white sugar
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch
- ⅛ teaspoon salt
- 1 ½ cups milk
- 2  egg yolks
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 2 (1 ounce) squares unsweetened chocolate
- 3 tablespoons butter
- 1 cup confectioners' sugar
- ¾ teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 tablespoons hot water

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9-inch round cake pan.
2. Make the cake: Beat flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, milk, shortening, egg, and vanilla at low speed, scraping the bowl constantly for 30 seconds. Beat on high speed, scraping bowl occasionally for 3 minutes. Pour batter into the prepared pan.
3. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes or until a wooden pick inserted near the center comes out clean. Remove from the pan and let cool on a wire rack.
4. Meanwhile, make the cream filling: In a 2-quart saucepan, mix sugar, cornstarch, and salt. Stir in milk gradually and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens and boils. Boil and stir 1 minute. Stir at least 1/2 of the mixture slowly into egg yolks. Return egg yolk mixture to the saucepan and boil and stir for 1 minute. Remove from heat and stir in 2 teaspoons vanilla. Let cool to room temperature.
5. Make the chocolate glaze: Heat chocolate and butter over low heat until melted. Remove from the heat and stir in the confectioners' sugar, and vanilla. Stir in water, one teaspoon at a time, until glaze is of desired consistency.
6. Assemble the cake: Split the cooled cake in half to make 2 thin layers. Fill the layers with the filling. Then spread the chocolate glaze over the top. Refrigerate any leftover cake.
