## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 1 (16 ounce) package skinless, boneless chicken breasts (such as Perdue®)
- 4 slices Fresh Mozzarella Cheese  BC
- 2 cups tomato sauce, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a baking pan with cooking spray. Place chicken on the prepared pan.
2. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, flipping chicken after 12 minutes. Remove from the oven, add desired amount of sauce, and top each breast with mozzarella cheese.
