## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 ½ pounds lamb shoulder
- 2  large eggplants, peeled and chopped
- 2 large tomatoes, chopped
- 2 large onions, chopped
- 2  green bell peppers, chopped
- 10 cloves garlic, chopped
- 1 tablespoon tomato paste
- ½ cup water
- 1 teaspoon allspice

## Instructions

1. In a large pot, melt the butter over medium heat, and brown the lamb on all sides. Mix in the eggplants, tomatoes, onions, green bell peppers, and garlic. Cook and stir until tender and lightly browned.
