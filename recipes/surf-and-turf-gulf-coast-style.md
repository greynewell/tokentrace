## Ingredients

- 1 pound sliced bacon
- 1 large Vidalia, or other sweet onion sliced into rings
- 4 (4 ounce) fillets red snapper, bones removed
- 1 dash soy sauce, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat an outdoor grill to medium-high heat.
2. Open fish basket, or similar wire cooking basket and line one side with strips of bacon, leaving a 1/2 inch space between slices. Cover the layer of bacon with a layer of onion rings. Place the fish fillets on top of the onion. Cover fish with more onion, then strips of bacon over the onion. Close the basket, and lightly sprinkle with soy sauce.
3. Place the basket on the hot grill, and cook for 5 to 7 minutes per side, or until the bacon is just cooked through. Remove from grill, and open the basket. Place a similarly sized plate upside down onto the food, and flip the basket and plate over so that the food is on top of the plate. Lift off the basket, and serve.
