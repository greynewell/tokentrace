## Ingredients

- 2  whole artichokes
- 1 clove garlic
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 1  bay leaf

## Instructions

1. Cut stem from artichokes and discard, making sure the bottom of each artichoke is flat. Cut top 1 inch (or so) of the artichoke and discard. Snip the thorny ends from each artichoke leaf with a pair of kitchen scissors.
2. Fill the bottom of a pot with a couple of inches of water, adding garlic, lemon juice, and bay leaf to the water. Place a steamer basket in the pot, making sure that the water does not flow over the bottom of the steamer basket.
3. Place the artichokes in the basket, resting on the flattened bottoms.
4. Bring water to a boil, cover the pot, and cook until the leaves can be easily pulled from the artichoke, 20 to 30 minutes.
