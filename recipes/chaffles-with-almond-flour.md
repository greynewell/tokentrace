## Ingredients

- 1 large egg
- 1 tablespoon blanched almond flour
- ¼ teaspoon baking powder
- ½ cup shredded mozzarella cheese
- cooking spray

## Instructions

1. Whisk egg, almond flour, and baking powder together in a bowl. Stir in mozzarella cheese; set batter aside.
2. Preheat a waffle iron according to the manufacturer's instructions.
3. Spray both sides of the preheated waffle iron with cooking spray. Pour 1/2 of the batter onto the waffle iron and spread it out from the center with a spoon.
