## Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon butter, or as needed
- 6 slices bread, or more to taste
- 1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk
- ¼ cup white sugar
- ¼ cup brown sugar
- 3  eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 dash salt
- 3 tablespoons melted butter
- ⅓ cup chocolate-hazelnut spread (such as Nutella®)
- ½ cup chopped walnuts

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a pie dish and set aside.
2. Tear bread into 1- to 2-inch pieces and place in the bottom of the prepared pie dish.
3. Combine evaporated milk, white sugar, brown sugar, eggs, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and salt in a bowl. Mix well and set aside.
4. Add melted butter to bread pieces in the pie dish and toss to combine.
5. Melt chocolate-hazelnut spread in a microwave-safe bowl in a microwave to soften slightly, 15 to 30 seconds. Place dollops on top of bread mixture, spreading to make an even layer. Sprinkle with walnuts. Pour milk-egg mixture on top, making sure bread is completely covered.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes.
