## Ingredients

- ¾ cup kosher salt
- 1 gallon cold water
- 2 pounds peeled and deveined large shrimp (21 to 30 per pound)
- 1 (16 ounce) package angel hair pasta
- ¼ cup unsalted butter
- ¼ cup olive oil
- 3 tablespoons minced garlic
- ⅓ cup white wine
- ¼ cup lemon juice
- ½ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- ½ cup chopped fresh parsley
- 1 tablespoon lemon zest

## Instructions

1. Dissolve the kosher salt in 1 gallon of water in a large pot. Add the shrimp, and refrigerate 2 to 4 hours. Drain and pat shrimp dry with paper towels.
2. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the angel hair pasta, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through but is still firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.
3. Meanwhile, melt the butter and olive oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Stir in the garlic, and cook until softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the shrimp, white wine, lemon juice, and red pepper flakes. Cook and stir until the shrimp is no longer translucent in the center, about 6 minutes. Stir in the black pepper, parsley, and lemon zest before tossing with the angel hair pasta.
