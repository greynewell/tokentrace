## Ingredients

- 6 tablespoons olive oil
- ½ teaspoon dried basil
- ½ teaspoon dried thyme
- ½ teaspoon dried oregano
- ½ teaspoon dried parsley
- ¼ teaspoon dried red pepper flakes
- 2 tablespoons minced onion
- 2 tablespoons minced green bell pepper
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic
- 7 ounces tomato sauce
- ½ teaspoon chicken soup base
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- ½ pound cheese tortellini
- 6 fluid ounces heavy cream

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; stir in tortellini and return to a gentle boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tortellini float to the top and filling is hot, about 4 minutes. Drain and set aside.
2. Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-low heat. Stir basil, thyme, oregano, parsley, and red pepper flakes into hot oil.
3. Add onion, bell pepper, and garlic; cook and stir until onions are translucent, about 2 minutes. Pour in tomato sauce and bring to a boil. Stir in sugar and chicken bouillon until dissolved.
4. Reduce heat and stir in cream and wine; bring close to a boil, stirring constantly. Gently stir in tortellini and serve.
