## Ingredients

- ¾ cup cold water or milk
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ cup ricotta cheese
- 1 tablespoon grated lemon zest (just the yellow part of the skin)
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 1  large egg
- ⅛ teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 tablespoons melted butter
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 1 cup self-rising flour
- 2 tablespoons self-rising flour

## Instructions

1. Whisk together cold water and baking soda in a mixing bowl. Add ricotta cheese, egg, lemon zest, vegetable oil, sugar, and vanilla; whisk until smooth, breaking up lumps of cheese as you mix.
2. Whisk in 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons self-rising flour, melted butter, and lemon juice until most of flour disappears into batter. Let batter sit at room temperature for 15 minutes.
3. Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat.
4. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the hot griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
