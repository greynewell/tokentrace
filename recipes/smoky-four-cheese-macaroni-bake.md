## Ingredients

- 1 (12 ounce) package macaroni
- ¼ cup butter
- ½ cup minced onion
- 1 ½ tablespoons minced garlic
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- ½ cup half-and-half cream
- 1 ½ cups milk
- ½ teaspoon dry mustard powder
- ½ teaspoon liquid smoke flavoring  (Optional)
- 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, cubed
- 1 cup shredded Swiss cheese
- 2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese
- ⅓ cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
2. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
3. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the onion, and cook for 3 minutes until it begins to soften. Add the garlic, and continue cooking until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 2 minutes more. Slowly stir in the flour, and cook, stirring constantly for 5 minutes.
4. Stir in the half-and-half and milk, and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low and stir in mustard powder and liquid smoke; simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add 1 cup of Parmesan cheese, along with the cream cheese, Swiss, Monterey Jack, and Cheddar cheeses; stir until melted. Season to taste with salt and pepper, then stir in the drained macaroni noodles. Pour into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese and breadcrumbs over the macaroni
5. Bake in preheated oven until bubbly and brown, about 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to stand 5 to 10 minutes before serving.
