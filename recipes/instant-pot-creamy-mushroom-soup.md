## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 ½ pounds fresh mushrooms, sliced
- 4 cups chicken broth
- ½ cup sherry
- 1 ½ teaspoons dried thyme
- 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1 teaspoon salt, or more to taste
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper, or more to taste
- 4 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 cup heavy cream

## Instructions

1. Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and select Saute function. Heat butter until melted. Saute onion for 2 to 3 minutes. Add garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes more. Add mushrooms and saute for 2 to 3 minutes more.
2. Stir chicken broth, sherry, thyme, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper into the pot. Close and lock the lid. Select Manual function; set timer for 5 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
3. Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 10 minutes. Release remaining pressure carefully using the quick-release method. Unlock and remove the lid.
