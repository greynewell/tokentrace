## Ingredients

- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 1 large egg, beaten
- ½ cup semisweet chocolate chips
- ¾ cup unsalted butter
- ⅔ cup semisweet chocolate chips
- 1 ¼ teaspoons vanilla extract
- 4 large eggs
- 1 ½ cups white sugar
- 1 cup all-purpose flour

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 30 muffin cups with paper or foil liners.
2. Mix cream cheese, sugar, and egg together in a small bowl for the filling. Fold in chocolate chips; set aside.
3. Place butter, chocolate chips, and vanilla extract for the cupcakes in the top of a double boiler over simmering water. Stir frequently, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, until chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly.
4. Beat eggs in a large bowl with a whisk or an electric mixer until frothy. Beat in sugar gradually until it dissolves. Slowly beat in flour. Fold in the cooled chocolate mixture. Fill the prepared cupcake liners 1/3 full with chocolate batter. Drop a heaping teaspoon of filling onto each cupcake, then cover with a generous spoonful of batter.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool in the tins for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
