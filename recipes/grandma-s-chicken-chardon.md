## Ingredients

- 8  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- 1  egg
- salt and pepper to taste
- 2 teaspoons garlic powder, divided
- 1 cup bread crumbs
- ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 pound sliced fresh mushrooms
- ¼ cup butter, melted
- 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. In a shallow bowl, beat the egg with salt, pepper and 1 teaspoon garlic powder. In a separate dish, mix bread crumbs with 1 teaspoon of garlic powder and Parmesan cheese. Set aside.
3. Mix together the melted butter and lemon juice. Pour about 2/3 of the butter mixture into the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Tilt pan to coat the bottom.
