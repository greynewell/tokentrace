## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- ¾ cup cocoa powder
- 1 tablespoon pumpkin pie spice
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 2 ½ sticks butter, softened
- 1 cup white sugar
- ¾ cup firmly packed brown sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 (10 ounce) bag pumpkin spice-flavored candies (such as Hershey's® Pumpkin Spice Kisses)

## Instructions

1. Stir flour, cocoa, pumpkin pie spice, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl.
2. Combine butter, white sugar, and brown sugar in a large bowl. Beat with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add eggs and vanilla extract; beat well. Mix in flour mixture gradually.
3. Chill cookie dough for 1 hour. Meanwhile, unwrap the candy kisses.
4. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line cookie sheets with parchment paper.
5. Roll dough into 1 1/2-inch balls. Flatten just enough to keep from rolling off the cookie sheets.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until edges are set and starting to brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Slide parchment paper onto wire cooling racks. Firmly push a candy kiss into the center of each cookie. Let cool completely.
