## Ingredients

- 1 (7.25 ounce) package macaroni and cheese mix
- 2 tablespoons butter
- ¼ cup milk
- 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
- ¾ cup pimento cheese spread
- 1 cup shredded Italian cheese blend
- 2 cups Italian seasoned bread crumbs
- ½ teaspoon paprika
- ½ teaspoon chili powder
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ teaspoon white sugar
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
- 4  eggs
- 3 tablespoons milk
- 4 cups peanut oil for frying, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Fill a pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Stir in macaroni, and return to a boil. Cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally until macaroni is cooked through but still firm to the bite, about 7 minutes. Drain. Stir in butter, 1/4 cup milk, and cheese packet from the macaroni and cheese package.
2. While macaroni is still hot, stir in Cheddar cheese, pimento cheese spread, and Italian cheese blend, and continue to stir until melted.
3. Place the macaroni and cheese mixture into a container and refrigerate until firm, about 4 hours.
4. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Remove the macaroni mixture from the refrigerator, and using a cookie scoop, scoop into balls. Place mac balls on the prepared baking sheet and freeze for at least 2 hours.
5. Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
6. Make a breading station: Whisk bread crumbs with paprika, chili powder, black pepper, sugar, salt, and cayenne in a shallow dish; set aside. Beat eggs with 3 tablespoons milk in a small bowl. Remove the mac balls from the freezer, coat in egg mixture, and then dredge in breading.
7. Fry the mac balls in hot oil in small batches until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain briefly on a paper towel-lined plate; serve hot.
