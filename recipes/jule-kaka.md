## Ingredients

- 2 cups scalded milk
- 1 cup butter, melted
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1 cup white sugar
- 2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
- ½ cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
- 8 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon ground cardamom
- ½ cup candied cherries, sliced
- ½ cup chopped candied citron
- 1 cup golden raisins
- 1  egg white, beaten

## Instructions

1. Dissolve yeast in warm water.
2. Pour cold milk into a wide, shallow, heavy-bottomed saucepan. Heat over medium heat, stirring frequently, until small bubbles appear around the outside of the saucepan.
3. Remove from the heat and transfer to a large bowl. Stir in sugar, melted butter, and salt; let sit until lukewarm, 5 to 10 minutes.
4. Add yeast mixture, then stir in 4 cups flour. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 2 hours.
5. Punch down dough. Stir in raisins, cherries, citron, and cardamom. Work in remaining 4 1/2 cups flour until a soft dough forms. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, 2 to 3 hours.
6. Knead dough slightly on a lightly floured surface. Divide into fourths and form into round loaves. Place loaves onto greased cookie sheets. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, 1 to 2 hours.
7. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Brush loaves with egg white.
8. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 30 to 40 minutes.
