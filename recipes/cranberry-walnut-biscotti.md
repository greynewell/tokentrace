## Ingredients

- 1 cup white sugar
- 3  eggs
- ½ cup canola oil
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon almond extract
- 1 teaspoon grated orange zest
- 3 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- ¾ cup sweetened dried cranberries
- ½ cup chopped walnuts

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line 2 cookie sheets with parchment paper.
2. Beat sugar, eggs, oil, extracts, and orange zest together in a large bowl.
3. Combine flour and baking powder; stir into egg mixture to form a stiff dough. Stir in cranberries and walnuts. Divide dough into 2 pieces. Form each piece into a roll the length of your cookie sheet. Use the parchment paper to help flatten the roll to about 1/2-inch thickness.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from cookie sheet to cool onto a wire rack until safe to handle, 10 to 15 minutes.
5. Slice rolls crosswise into 1/2-inch slices. Place slices back on the cookie sheet, cut-side up, and continue baking until lightly toasted, 5 to 7 minutes per side.
