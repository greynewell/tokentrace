## Ingredients

- 2  eggs
- ¼ cup brown sugar
- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- ⅔ cup milk
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Beat eggs and sugar together in a bowl using an electric mixer on medium speed until well blended.
2. Mix flour and baking powder together in a separate bowl. Slowly mix into the sugar-egg mixture; batter will thicken rather quickly. Slowly add milk. Stir in vanilla extract.
3. Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
