## Ingredients

- nonstick cooking spray
- 1 (12 ounce) package yolk-free egg noodles (such as No Yolks®)
- ¾ cup packed brown sugar
- ½ cup butter, melted and divided
- ¾ cup chopped pecans, divided
- 4  eggs
- 1 cup sour cream
- ¾ cup applesauce
- ⅔ cup white sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ¾ teaspoon ground cinnamon

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a large fluted tube pan (such as Bundt®) with cooking spray.
2. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in egg noodles and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 10 to 12 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, mix brown sugar and 1/4 cup butter in a small bowl. Press butter mixture over the bottom and a little up the sides of the prepared pan. Sprinkle 1/2 of the pecans over the butter mixture and press in well.
4. Drain noodles. Combine remaining pecans and butter, eggs, sour cream, applesauce, sugar, salt, vanilla, and cinnamon in a large bowl. Add noodles and mix well. Pour mixture into the pan.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center of the kugel comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool on a wire rack for 1 hour. Run a table knife around the edges to loosen. Place a large plate or platter over the pan and invert carefully to remove kugel.
