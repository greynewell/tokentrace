## Ingredients

- 1 (16 ounce) package Jimmy Dean® Premium Pork Regular Sausage
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- ¼ teaspoon onion powder
- ⅛ teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ cup all-purpose flour
- 1 cup chicken stock
- 3 ½ cups whole milk, or more as needed
- salt and freshly cracked pepper to taste
- 2 dashes hot pepper sauce

## Instructions

1. Add sausage to a large skillet or heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir with a spatula, breaking apart the sausage until cooked and starting to crisp, 5 to 7 minutes.
2. Add butter, onion powder, and garlic powder; stir until butter is melted.
3. Sprinkle flour over sausage and butter and stir until combined. Reduce heat slightly and cook until thick, 1 to 2 minutes.
4. Pour in chicken stock, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Simmer until stock is absorbed and mixture is thickened, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in milk until gravy is hot and bubbly.
5. Season to taste with salt and lots of freshly cracked pepper. If gravy becomes too thick, thin out with more milk.
