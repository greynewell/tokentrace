## Ingredients

- 1 (10 inch) flour tortilla
- 2 teaspoons mayonnaise
- ¼ cup shredded lettuce
- 3 slices tomatoes (such as Campari(R))
- 2 slices deli ham
- 1 slice Cheddar cheese
- 2 slices cooked bacon, cut in half
- 2 slices deli turkey
- 2 teaspoons salted butter

## Instructions

1. Place tortilla on a cutting board. Starting at the center of the tortilla, cut a straight line all the way down to the edge with a knife.
2. Think of the tortilla as having a total of 4 filling locations, each in its own quarter, like a clock. To assemble, place the ingredients on the tortilla as follows: spread the mayonnaise on the lower left quarter, and top with lettuce and tomatoes. Place ham in the upper left quarter. Layer Cheddar cheese and bacon in the top right corner. Place the turkey in the lower right corner.
3. Start at the lower left quarter that borders the cut in the tortilla, and fold that filled quarter up and over the top left quarter. Next, fold that same section over the top right corner. Finally, fold that down and over the lower right quarter, ending with a 4-layer triangle. (You'll find a photo on this recipe giving you a visual on how to do the folding.)
4. Melt butter in a small skillet over medium-low heat. Place the folded tortilla triangle into the skillet, press down slightly, and cook until it starts to brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip the tortilla and repeat. Remove from the skillet, cut in half, and serve.
