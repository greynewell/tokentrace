## Ingredients

- 1 (18.25 ounce) package white cake mix
- 1 cup water
- ¼ cup vegetable oil
- 3  eggs
- 1 teaspoon strawberry extract
- ¼ cup chocolate syrup
- 3 drops red food coloring
- ⅔ cup confectioners' sugar
- 3 tablespoons chocolate syrup

## Instructions

1. Grease and flour a 12-cup bundt pan. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Blend the cake mix, water, oil, and eggs on low speed until moistened. Beat 3 minutes on medium speed. Pour 1/2 of the batter into the bundt pan.
3. Measure 1/2 of the remaining batter into a small bowl and stir in the strawberry extract and food color (as much as you want to make a pretty, dark pink color). Carefully pour this into the pan.
4. Stir 1/4 cup chocolate syrup into the remaining batter and carefully pour this into the pan on top of the strawberry batter.
5. Bake for about 40 minutes in a 350 degree F (175 degrees C) oven. Cool 15 minutes.
6. Remove from pan and drizzle chocolate glaze over the top.
7. To make chocolate glaze: Mix together confectioners' sugar and 3 tablespoons chocolate syrup until smooth. If necessary, a few drops of water or a small amount of additional confectioners' sugar may be added until the desired consistency is obtained. Drizzle over top of the bundt cake.
