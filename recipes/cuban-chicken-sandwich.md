## Ingredients

- 1 ½ pounds chicken tenders
- ½ cup mojo marinade (such as Badia®), or as needed
- 1 tablespoon olive oil, or more as needed
- 8 thin slices  sweet onion
- 1 (1 pound) loaf Cuban bread
- ¼ cup yellow mustard
- 20  dill pickle slices
- 4 slices Swiss cheese

## Instructions

1. Place chicken tenders between 2 sheets of heavy plastic on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet until flattened out. Place chicken in a resealable plastic bag and add enough mojo marinade to cover the chicken. Marinate in the refrigerator for 2 hours, or up to overnight.
2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Remove chicken tenders from the marinade, drain, and place in the skillet. Cook until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Transfer chicken to a plate.
3. Add sliced onions to the same skillet, adding a bit more oil if necessary, and cook until softened, about 3 minutes. Remove from skillet.
4. Cut Cuban bread into 4 rolls. Slice each in half lengthwise without cutting all the way through. Cover the bottom and the top of each roll with yellow mustard. Assemble the sandwich by placing pickle slices on the bottom, followed by chicken, Swiss cheese, and onion. Cut each sandwich in half at an angle, and serve.
