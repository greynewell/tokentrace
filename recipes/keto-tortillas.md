## Ingredients

- 1 cup blanched almond flour
- 3 tablespoons coconut flour
- 2 teaspoons xanthan gum
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 pinch salt
- 2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar
- 1  egg
- 3 tablespoons water
- cooking spray

## Instructions

1. Combine almond flour, coconut flour, xanthan gum, baking powder, and salt in the bowl of a food processor; pulse until well combined. Pour apple cider vinegar into mixture and blend until smooth. Beat egg and water in a small bowl; add egg mixture to the food processor, 1 tablespoon at a time, and blend until a sticky dough ball is formed.
2. Place dough on a surface sprinkled with almond flour and knead until soft, about 2 minutes. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and let it stand for 10 minutes.
3. Divide dough into 8 equal balls; roll out each ball into a 5-inch disc between 2 sheets of parchment paper.
4. Heat an iron skillet over medium-high heat and grease with cooking spray. Place dough disc in the hot skillet for just 5 seconds; flip it immediately with a spatula, and cook until lightly golden, about 40 seconds. Flip and cook for another 40 seconds.
