## Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon shortening, or as needed
- ½ cup whipping cream
- 3 tablespoons white sugar
- ¼ pound chopped candied orange peel
- ½ cup all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting
- ⅓ cup slivered almonds
- 4 ounces semisweet chocolate, melted

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease baking sheets with shortening and dust with flour.
2. Stir cream and sugar together in a bowl. Stir in orange peel, flour, and almonds until combined. Drop batter in teaspoonfuls onto the prepared baking sheets, keeping each cookie well apart from each other.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes.
