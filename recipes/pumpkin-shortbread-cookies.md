## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ cup unsalted butter, softened
- ½ cup powdered sugar
- 2 tablespoons powdered sugar
- ½ cup pumpkin puree
- 1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract
- ¼ cup white sugar, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Whisk flour, pumpkin pie spice, salt, and baking soda together in a bowl until combined.
2. Beat butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Add 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons powdered sugar and beat until smooth. Mix in pumpkin puree and vanilla extract. Beat on medium- high speed until completely incorporated. Add 1/2 of the flour mixture, mixing until just combined. Add remaining flour mixture and mix until just combined.
3. Cover bowl and refrigerate dough until chilled, about 1 hour.
4. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
5. Roll out dough to 1/4-inch thickness on a lightly floured surface. Using a pizza cutter or pastry wheel, cut dough into 1x2-inch rectangles. Use the back of a bamboo skewer to poke 3 holes into each cookie. Place cookies 1/2 inch apart on the prepared baking sheets. Sprinkle each cookie with white sugar.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are lightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Cool shortbread on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
