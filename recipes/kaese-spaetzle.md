## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- ¾ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- ⅛ teaspoon pepper
- 3  eggs
- ⅜ cup 2% milk
- 3 tablespoons butter
- 1  onion, sliced

## Instructions

1. Sift together flour, nutmeg, salt and pepper. Beat eggs in a medium bowl. Alternately mix in milk and the flour mixture until smooth. Let stand for 30 minutes.
