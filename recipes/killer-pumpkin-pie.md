## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour plus
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons white sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ cup canola oil
- 2 tablespoons rice milk
- ½ cup white sugar
- ¼ cup dark brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground ginger
- ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ¼ teaspoon ground cloves
- 1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
- 2 tablespoons canola oil
- 2  large eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 1 ¼ cups rice milk

## Instructions

1. Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Stir together the flour, sugar, and salt in a 9 inch pie pan, and make a well in the center. Pour the oil and rice milk into the well, then mix with a fork until a dough forms. Use your hands to press the mixture evenly into the bottom and sides of the pan. Crimp the edge of the crust.
3. Stir together the white sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, salt, ginger, nutmeg, and cloves in a large bowl; set aside. Whisk together the pumpkin puree, oil, eggs, vanilla, and rice milk in a separate bowl until evenly blended. Add the pumpkin mixture to the dry ingredients and stir until fully blended. Pour into the prepared crust and place on a cookie sheet in the preheated oven.
4. Bake for 10 minutes. Reduce temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake for 40 to 50 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. The center may still wiggle a little but will firm up out of the oven. Cool on a metal rack.
