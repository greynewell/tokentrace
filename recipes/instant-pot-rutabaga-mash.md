## Ingredients

- 1 cup water
- 2 pounds rutabaga, peeled and chopped into 1-inch cubes
- ¼ cup half-and-half
- 1 tablespoon butter
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon pepper
- ¼ teaspoon garlic powder

## Instructions

1. Pour water into a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and set the trivet inside. Place rutabaga into a steamer basket and set inside the pot. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 8 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
2. Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Drain rutabaga. Return rutabaga to pot or place into a medium bowl.
3. Add half-and-half, butter, salt, pepper, and garlic powder to the rutabaga and mash to desired consistency. The rutabaga will have a chunky texture. For a smoother texture, use a food processor. Serve warm.
