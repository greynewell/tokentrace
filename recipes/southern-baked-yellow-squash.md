## Ingredients

- 3 pounds yellow summer squash, cut into 1-inch cubes
- ½ cup dry bread crumbs
- ½ cup chopped onion
- 2  eggs
- ¼ cup butter, melted
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon black pepper
- ¼ cup butter, melted

## Instructions

1. Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 2-quart baking dish.
