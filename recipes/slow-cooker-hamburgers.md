## Ingredients

- 1 sheet aluminum foil
- 1 ⅓ pounds 85% lean ground beef
- 2 teaspoons liquid smoke flavoring
- 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
- 1 teaspoon grill seasoning (such as Montreal Steak Seasoning®)
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ⅓ cup dry bread crumbs
- 1  egg, beaten
- 4 teaspoons browning sauce (such as Kitchen Bouquet®)
- 4  hamburger buns

## Instructions

1. Set a slow cooker to Low.
2. Create a rack for the bottom of the cooker by rolling aluminum foil into 1-inch rolls. For a 5-quart, oblong cooker, make 4 rolls, using the length of the cooker as a guide. Fold in any long ends and squeeze back on the rolls. Evenly space the rolls along the bottom of the cooker.
3. Combine ground beef, liquid smoke, Worcestershire sauce, steak seasoning, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Add bread crumbs and egg. Mix all ingredients using your hands until they are evenly distributed.
4. Form meat mixture into 4 patties, about 1/2 inch thick. Brush each side of the patties with 1/2 teaspoon of browning sauce, and place on the aluminum "rack", being careful not to overlap.
5. Cook on Low for about 4 1/2 hours until burgers are no longer pink in the center. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
6. Place each cooked patty on a hamburger bun.
