- 2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves
- ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 cup vegetable stock

- 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

## Instructions

1. Thinly slice 6 Yukon potatoes (we used a mandoline for an even consistent cut).
2. In a saucepan, melt butter on medium heat. Add in flour and whisk until smooth. Add bay leaf and begin to add the Almond Breeze while constantly stirring with a whisk. Add garlic, nutmeg, and thyme. Mix in Parmesan cheese and vegetable stock and bring the mixture to a simmer to thicken. Salt and pepper to taste. Remove bay leaf and remove almond milk mixture from heat.
3. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Grease your casserole dish with a nonstick spray.
4. Lay half of the sliced potatoes on the bottom of the casserole dish. Pour half of the Almond Breeze mixture over the the potatoes. Repeat the process until you have a second layer. Spread the Cheddar on top and place casserole dish into the oven. Bake for 45 minutes or until potatoes are tender and fully cooked.
