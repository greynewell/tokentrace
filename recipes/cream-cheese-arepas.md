## Ingredients

- ¾ cup milk at room temperature
- ¼ cup cream cheese at room temperature
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- 1 cup arepas flour (such as P.A.N.®)
- ½ teaspoon vegetable oil, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Mix milk, cream cheese, and salt in a mixing bowl; whisk together until smooth and foamy.
2. Add sugar and arepas flour to milk mixture; mix with a spatula until dough is soft, thick, and workable, about 1 minute.
3. Divide dough into 4 portions (for the 4 wells in the maker).
4. Form each quarter into a ball and use wet hands to gently shape it into a thick patty about 1/2-inch thick.
5. If you see little cracks on the outside, the dough may be a little too dry; add more milk.
6. Heat arepas maker; lightly coat wells of the arepas machine with vegetable oil.
7. Place patties into wells of maker, close lid, and let cook through one cooking cycle of machine, about 5 minutes.
8. For a crisper crust, flip arepas, using a wooden spoon or spatula, and repeat cooking cycle for 5 more minutes.
9. Patties will be crusty and browned on both sides and the insides will be cooked all the way through.
