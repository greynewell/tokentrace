## Ingredients

- 1 (19.8 ounce) package brownie mix
- 2 (3.9 ounce) packages instant chocolate pudding mix
- 1 (16 ounce) package frozen whipped topping, thawed
- 3 (1.4 ounce) bars chocolate covered English toffee

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan.
2. Make the brownies: Combine brownie mix, eggs, vegetable oil, and water in a large bowl. Mix with a wooden spoon until well blended. Spread into the prepared baking pan.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted 2 inches from the side of the pan comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Let cool completely.
4. Meanwhile, prepare the pudding: Whisk milk and pudding mix together in a large bowl until smooth; set aside.
5. To assemble: Crumble 1/2 of the brownies on the bottom of a glass punch bowl; spoon 1/2 of the pudding on top. Crush 1 toffee bar over pudding and top with 1/2 of the whipped topping. Repeat layers in the same order, then refrigerate until ready to serve, saving the last toffee bar to crumble and sprinkle on top before serving.
