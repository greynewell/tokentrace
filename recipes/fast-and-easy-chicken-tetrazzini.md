## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 1 (12 ounce) package rotini pasta
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2  onions, chopped
- 2 stalks celery, finely chopped
- ½ cup finely chopped red bell pepper
- 2 ¼ cups milk
- 1 (10.75 ounce) can  cream of mushroom soup
- ½ teaspoon poultry seasoning
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1  rotisserie chicken, meat removed and chopped
- 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, divided

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare a 13x9-inch baking dish with nonstick cooking spray.
2. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain. Pour rotini into prepared baking dish.
3. Melt butter in a heavy saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir onions, celery, and bell pepper in melted butter until softened, about 5 minutes.
4. Stir milk, cream of mushroom soup, poultry seasoning, salt, and black pepper into the onion mixture. Reduce heat to medium-low and bring to a simmer; about 5 minutes. Add chicken and 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese to the milk mixture; remove immediately from heat and pour over the rotini. Top pasta and sauce mixture with remaining Cheddar cheese.
5. Bake in preheated oven until cheese is melted and beginning to brown, about 25 minutes.
