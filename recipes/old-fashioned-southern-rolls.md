## Ingredients

- 1 cup milk
- ½ cup shortening
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 1 cup cold water
- 1  egg
- 2 teaspoons active dry yeast
- 5 ½ cups all-purpose flour, divided
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt

## Instructions

1. Warm the milk in a small saucepan until it bubbles, then remove from heat. Mix in the shortening and sugar; stir until melted. Add cold water and let cool until lukewarm.
2. Pour milk mixture into a large bowl. Add egg and yeast; mix well. Beat in 3 cups of flour and let stand for 20 minutes.
3. Sift in baking powder, baking soda, salt, and 1 cup flour. Stir in the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, beating well after each addition. When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Lightly oil a large bowl, place the dough in the bowl, and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
4. Divide the dough into 12 equal pieces. Divide each piece in half and form into 24 rolls. Place the rounds in a lightly greased 9x13-inch baking pan or on lightly greased baking sheets. Cover the rolls with a damp cloth and let rise until doubled in volume, about 40 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
5. Bake in the preheated oven until golden, 15 to 20 minutes.
