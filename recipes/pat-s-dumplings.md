## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 3 tablespoons shortening
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ¼ cup water

## Instructions

1. Mix together flour and salt.
2. Cut shortening into flour/salt mixture using a pastry blender, fork or two knives.
3. Stir in water to form a soft dough.
4. On a floured surface, roll out dough very thin with a rolling pin.
5. Cut into 1 inch wide strips (I use a pizza cutter, but a sharp knife works also).
6. Tear 1 inch long pieces of dough from these strips and drop into simmering broth.
7. Cook 10 minutes with the pot lid off, then 10 minutes more with the lid on.
8. Serve with the broth and chicken meat, if using.
