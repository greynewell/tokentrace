## Ingredients

- 1 cup canola oil
- ½ cup molasses
- 2  eggs
- 2 cups whole wheat flour
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ cups white sugar
- 1 tablespoon ground ginger
- 2 teaspoons baking soda
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 (8 ounce) package Neufchatel cheese, softened
- 1 cup confectioners' sugar
- 1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 cup heavy cream, whipped
- 1 small bunch fresh mint leaves, or as desired

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 36 mini muffin cups.
2. Combine oil, molasses, and eggs in a large bowl.
3. Combine whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, sugar, ginger, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt in a separate bowl. Stir into egg mixture until well combined.
4. Roll cookie dough into 1 1/4-inch balls. Place balls into the prepared muffin cups. Press dough up the sides of the cups using your fingers or a wooden spoon handle.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until no longer doughy but still soft and edges are set, 10 to 15 minutes.
6. Remove from the oven. Gently reform the holes in each cookie cup using a wooden spoon handle. Let cool for 2 minutes. Remove cookie cups from the pans and transfer to wire racks to cool completely, 15 to 30 minutes.
7. Beat Neufchatel cheese in a medium bowl using an electric mixer until fluffy. Beat in confectioners' sugar and vanilla extract. Gently fold in whipped cream.
8. Spoon filling into a pastry bag; pipe into each cooled cookie cup. Garnish each cookie cup with a mint sprig.
