## Ingredients

- ⅔ cup toasted slivered almonds
- 1 cup graham cracker crumbs
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 1 pinch salt
- ¼ cup butter, melted
- 4  egg yolks
- 1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
- ½ cup key lime juice
- ¾ cup cold heavy cream
- ½ teaspoon grated lime zest

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Make crust: Pulse almonds in a food processor until finely ground, then pour into a medium bowl. Add graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and salt. Pour in melted butter and mix until evenly moistened. Press into a 9-inch pie plate.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden brown, 10 to 13 minutes.
4. While crust is baking, make filling: Beat condensed milk, cream, egg yolks, and lime zest in a large bowl until well combined. Whisk in lime juice, a little at a time, to thicken custard. Pour custard into pie crust.
5. Bake until custard is set, about 15 minutes. Cool to room temperature on a wire rack, then cover loosely with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for 8 hours to overnight.
