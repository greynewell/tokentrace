## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- ¼ cup white sugar
- ¼ cup brown sugar
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
- ½ cup unsalted butter, softened
- ½ cup white sugar
- 3 tablespoons lemon zest
- 2 large eggs
- 3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- ½ cup sour cream
- ¼ cup milk
- ½ cup white chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat an 8-inch springform or cake pan with cooking spray and line the bottom with parchment paper; set aside.
2. Stir flour and sugars together in a small bowl with a fork. Add melted butter and mix until crumbly, leaving some large crumbs. Set topping aside while you make the cake.
3. Combine butter, sugar, and lemon zest in a large bowl and cream with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add eggs, lemon juice, baking powder, vanilla, salt, and cinnamon. Beat until well combined, about 3 minutes. Add in flour gradually on low speed, mixing until combined. Add sour cream and milk and mix batter until smooth, about 4 minutes.
4. Fold white chocolate chips into the batter. Pour into the prepared pan and sprinkle with the topping.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until light golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for about 30 minutes before removing from the pan and serving.
