## Ingredients

- 1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle Irish stout beer (such as Guinness®)
- ½ cup milk
- ½ cup vegetable oil
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- 3 large eggs
- ¾ cup sour cream
- 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 2 cups white sugar
- ¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 ½ teaspoons baking soda
- ¼ cup unsweetened cocoa powder, or more to taste
- ¼ cup Irish stout beer (such as Guinness®)
- ½ cup butter, softened
- ½ cup cream cheese, softened
- 2 ½ cups sifted confectioners' sugar, or more as needed

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 12-cup muffin tins or line cups with paper liners.
2. Whisk stout beer, milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until evenly blended. Beat in eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix in sour cream. Whisk together flour, sugar, cocoa powder, and baking soda in a separate bowl. Gradually mix the flour mixture ingredients into the beer mixture.
3. Spoon cupcake batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 3/4 full.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until cupcakes are risen and set in the middle but still soft and tender, about 25 minutes. Cool in the tins, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely, about 1 hour.
5. Whisk cocoa powder and stout beer together in a bowl. Beat in butter and cream cheese using an electric mixer until well combined. Gradually beat in confectioners' sugar, 1 cup at a time, until frosting has desired sweetness. Spread or pipe frosting onto cooked cupcakes.
