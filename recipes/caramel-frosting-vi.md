## Ingredients

- 1 cup brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 3 tablespoons butter
- ¼ cup milk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ⅓ cup toasted, chopped pecans

## Instructions

1. In a shallow 6-inch saucepan, thoroughly mix brown sugar and flour. Stir in butter and milk, and cook over medium-high heat until mixture comes to a rolling boil. Boil exactly 1-1/2 minutes.
2. Remove from heat. Allow to cool 5 minutes. Beat with a wooden spoon until mixture begins to thicken. Mix in vanilla and continue beating until frosting is the consistency of thick honey, no more than 1 to 2 minutes.
3. Immediately pour caramel frosting onto cooled cake and quickly spread with the back of a warm spoon before frosting begins to set up. Quickly sprinkle top of cake with toasted pecans. Frosting will set up completely in a few hours.
