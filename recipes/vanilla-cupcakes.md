## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups self-rising flour
- 1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 2 cups white sugar
- 4  eggs
- 1 cup milk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ½ cup unsalted butter
- 4 cups confectioners' sugar
- ¼ cup milk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line two 12-cup muffin tins with paper liners.
2. Combine self-rising and all-purpose flours in a bowl.
3. Cream butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth. Gradually add sugar and beat until fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add flour mixture in 3 batches, alternating with milk and vanilla, beating batter briefly after each addition. Fill the cupcake liners about 3/4 full with batter.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, about 20 minutes. Cool in the tins for 10 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
5. Meanwhile, cream butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer until smooth. Mix in 1/2 of the confectioners sugar, then mix in milk and vanilla. Beat until smooth and creamy, 3 to 5 minutes. Gradually add remaining confectioners' sugar and mix until icing is thick enough for spreading.
6. Spread icing onto cooled cupcakes.
