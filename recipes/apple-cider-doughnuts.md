## Ingredients

- 2 cups white sugar, divided
- 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
- 1 ½ cups apple cider
- 3 ¾ cups all-purpose flour, divided
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ¼ cup butter, melted
- 2  eggs, lightly beaten
- 1  egg yolk, lightly beaten
- 6 cups vegetable oil for frying

## Instructions

1. Mix 1 cup sugar and 1 tablespoon cinnamon together in a resealable plastic bag.
2. Bring apple cider to a boil in a saucepan; cook, stirring occasionally, until cider has reduced to 1/2 cup, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and cool.
3. Whisk 1 cup flour, 1 cup sugar, baking powder, 2 teaspoons cinnamon, and salt together in a large bowl. Mix butter, eggs, egg yolk, and cooled cider together in a separate bowl until smooth; stir into flour mixture. Stir remaining 2 3/4 cups flour into mixture until dough is smooth. Refrigerate dough for 10 minutes.
4. Heat oil in a large pot or deep fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
5. Turn dough onto a well-floured work surface using floured hands; pat dough to 1/2-inch thickness. Cut dough into doughnuts using a doughnut cutter or 2 round cookie cutters (1 large and 1 small). Gather scraps and re-pat dough to cut out as many doughnuts as possible.
6. Carefully slide doughnuts, working in batches, into hot oil; fry until doughnuts rise to the surface and begin to brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip doughnuts and continue frying until opposite side is browned, about 1 1/2 minutes.
7. Remove doughnuts with a slotted spoon and place on a paper towel-lined plate to cool until easily handled, about 1 minute. Toss cooled doughnuts in the reserved bag of cinnamon sugar. Bring oil back to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) before frying next batch.
