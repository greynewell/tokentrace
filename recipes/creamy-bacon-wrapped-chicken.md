## Ingredients

- 2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
- 2 bunches green onions, chopped
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 6  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded 1/4 inch thick
- 2 (16 ounce) packages sliced bacon

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Set a wired rack into a baking dish.
2. Mix together cream cheese and green onions in a bowl until well combined; season with salt and black pepper.
3. Spread about 1/4 cup cream cheese mixture over each chicken breast. Starting at the narrow end, roll chicken breasts over filling. Wrap each chicken breast in 4 slices of bacon. Place wrapped chicken onto the rack in the prepared dish.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until bacon is browned, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a breast should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
