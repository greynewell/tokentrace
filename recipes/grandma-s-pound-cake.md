## Ingredients

- 1 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 3 cups white sugar
- 6 large eggs, at room temperature
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- ¼ teaspoon baking soda
- 1 (8 ounce) container sour cream, at room temperature
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon almond extract
- 2 tablespoons powdered sugar, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10-inch tube pan.
2. Beat butter with an electric mixer until soft and creamy, scraping the sides of the bowl as you go, about 2 minutes. Gradually add in sugar on medium speed. Add eggs one at a time, beating after each addition until the yellow disappears from the previous one.
3. Combine flour and baking soda in a bowl. Add sour cream to the creamed butter mixture alternately with the flour, ending with sour cream. Beat in vanilla and almond extract just until combined. Pour batter into the prepared cake pan.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour and 20 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Run a table knife around the edges to loosen. Invert carefully onto a serving plate or cooling rack. Let cool, about 30 minutes. Dust with powdered sugar.
