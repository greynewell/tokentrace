## Ingredients

- 2 teaspoons olive oil, or to taste
- 1 cup long-grain rice
- 2 cups coconut milk
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 2 (5 ounce) fillets tilapia
- 1 pinch lemon-pepper seasoning, or to taste
- 1 stick salted butter

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add rice and cook and stir until toasted, 2 to 3 minutes. Add coconut milk, salt, and pepper; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until liquid is absorbed and rice is tender, about 15 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, season tilapia fillets with lemon-pepper seasoning on both sides. Place in a glass pan. Break the stick of butter in half and place directly on top of the fillets.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until butter is fully melted and bubbling, 5 to 7 minutes. Ladle some of the butter back over the fish and reduce the oven temperature to 330 degrees F (165 degrees C).
5. Bake in the preheated oven until fish looks just about done, 3 to 5 minutes more. Raise the temperature back to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) and bake until the edges start to get golden brown. Serve with rice.
