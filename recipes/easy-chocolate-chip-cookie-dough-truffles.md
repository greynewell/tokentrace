## Ingredients

- ½ cup butter, softened
- ¾ cup packed brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
- ½ cup miniature semisweet chocolate chips
- ½ cup toffee baking bits
- 1 pound chocolate confectioners' coating

## Instructions

1. Beat the butter and brown sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Beat in the vanilla extract. Add flour, alternately with sweetened condensed milk, beating well after each addition. Fold in the chocolate chips and toffee bits; mixing just enough to evenly combine.
2. Using a small cookie scoop, make 1-inch balls and place them on waxed paper lined baking sheets. Refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour.
3. Melt the chocolate coating in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring after each melting, for 1 to 3 minutes (depending on your microwave). Do not overheat or coating will scorch. Dip the dough balls in the chocolate coating, allowing any excess to drip off. Place on waxed-paper lined baking sheets and sprinkle the truffles with additional toffee pieces. Refrigerate until firm, about 15 minutes. Store in the refrigerator.
