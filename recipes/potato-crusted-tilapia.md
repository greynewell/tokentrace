## Ingredients

- 1 cup precooked shredded potatoes
- 1  shallot, chopped
- 1 teaspoon honey mustard
- ½ teaspoon red pepper flakes
- ½ teaspoon garlic salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 4 teaspoons mayonnaise
- 4  tilapia fillets
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1  lemon, cut into wedges

## Instructions

1. Combine shredded potatoes, shallot, honey mustard, red pepper flakes, garlic salt, and black pepper in a bowl. Spread each portion of fish with 1 teaspoons mayonnaise and top with 1/4 the potato mixture, pressing onto the fish.
