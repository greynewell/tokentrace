## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 3 tablespoons white sugar
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 6 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 2  eggs, beaten
- ⅓ cup half-and-half cream
- ¾ teaspoon lemon zest
- ¾ cup fresh huckleberries
- 1 cup powdered sugar
- ¼ cup lemon juice
- ¼ teaspoon lemon zest

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.
2. Whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Using a pastry blender, cut in butter and lemon juice until evenly mixed and slightly crumbly. Whisk together the eggs and half-and-half in a small bowl; add 3/4 teaspoons lemon zest with the egg mixture to flour mixture, and mix gently just until well blended and forming a dough. Fold in the huckleberries.
3. Divide dough in half, and on a floured surface, shape each half into a ball, then flatten slightly. Cut each round into six wedges; place on prepared baking sheet.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until tops are golden brown, about 12 minutes. Whisk together powdered sugar and lemon juice to make a glaze. Drizzle glaze on cooled scones. Sprinkle with remaining lemon zest for garnish.
