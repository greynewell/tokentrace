## Ingredients

- 1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk
- ½ cup yellow grits
- ½ cup chicken broth
- 1 tablespoon salted butter
- ⅓ cup grated sharp Cheddar cheese
- 3 slices bacon
- ¾ cup frozen bell peppers
- ⅓ pound frozen medium shrimp - thawed, shelled, and deveined
- ½ teaspoon taco seasoning mix
- 2 teaspoons hot sauce, or to taste  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Combine evaporated milk, grits, chicken broth, and butter in a saucepan over medium-high heat; bring to a boil. Cook, stirring constantly, until thickened, 5 to 7 minutes. Add Cheddar cheese and stir until incorporated. Remove from the heat and set aside.
