## Ingredients

- ¼ cup white sugar
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon baking soda
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ cup butter
- 1 (8 ounce) container plain yogurt
- ½ cup raisins
- ½ cup confectioners' sugar  (Optional)
- 1 teaspoon orange juice  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
2. Stir white sugar and cinnamon together in a bowl. Combine half the sugar mixture, flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a separate bowl. Cut butter into flour mixture using a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Make a well in the center of the crumbly mixture; add yogurt and raisins to the well. Stir just until dough clings together.
3. Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead 8 to 10 times. Roll dough into 1/2-inch thickness and cut with a 2 1/2-inch biscuit cutter. Arrange biscuits on a baking sheet; sprinkle with remaining sugar mixture.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes.
5. Whisk confectioners' sugar and orange juice together in a bowl until icing is smooth; drizzle over warm biscuits.
