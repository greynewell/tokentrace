## Ingredients

- 3  eggs
- 1 cup white sugar
- ⅔ cup pumpkin puree
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice
- ¾ cup all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ cup powdered sugar
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, at room temperature
- 1 cup powdered sugar
- ¼ cup margarine
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease and flour a 15x10-inch jelly roll pan.
2. Place eggs in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Beat on high speed until pale and thick, about 5 minutes. Gradually add sugar, beating well. Stir in pumpkin and lemon juice.
3. Combine flour, cinnamon, baking powder, ginger, nutmeg, and salt in a separate bowl. Fold into the egg mixture. Spoon batter into the prepared pan, spreading evenly into the corners.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 15 minutes. Take care not to over bake.
5. Invert cake onto a clean dish towel. Sprinkle 1/4 cup powdered sugar on top. Lift up one long edge carefully and roll the cake into a log, wrapped in the towel. Set aside until cool, at least 15 minutes.
6. Combine cream cheese, powdered sugar, margarine, and vanilla extract in a bowl. Beat until smooth and creamy. Unroll the cake and spread filling on top. Roll cake up again and refrigerate, seam-side down, until set.
