## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups prepared yellow mustard
- ½ cup packed brown sugar
- ¾ cup cider vinegar
- ¾ cup beer
- 1 tablespoon chili powder
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground white pepper
- ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1 ½ teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
- 2 tablespoons butter, room temperature
- 1 ½ teaspoons liquid smoke flavoring
- 1 teaspoon Louisiana-style hot sauce, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Stir together mustard, vinegar, beer, and brown sugar in a heavy non-reactive saucepan. Season with chili powder and black, white, and cayenne peppers. Bring to a simmer over medium-low heat and cook for about 20 minutes. Do not boil, or you will scorch sugar and peppers.
2. Mix in butter, Worcestershire sauce, and liquid smoke. Simmer for 15 to 20 minutes more. Season with hot sauce. Pour into an airtight jar and refrigerate to allow flavors to blend, 8 hours to overnight. (The vinegar taste will lessen as sauce cools.)
