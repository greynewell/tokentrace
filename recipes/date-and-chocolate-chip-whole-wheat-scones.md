## Ingredients

- 2 cups whole wheat flour
- 1 cup all purpose flour
- 3 tablespoons baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon
- ⅓ cup cold butter
- ¾ cup chopped dates
- ½ cup chocolate chips
- 1 ½ cups milk
- milk for brushing
- extra sugar and cinnamon to sprinkle

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.
2. Sift together wheat and all-purpose flours, baking powder, salt, sugar and cinnamon into a large bowl. Rub butter into dry ingredients until it resembles fine breadcrumbs. Stir in dates and chocolate chips. Mix in the milk, just until blended and form dough into a ball.
3. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface. Roll into a circle about 1/2 inch thick. Dip a round cookie cutter into flour (to prevent sticking) then cut out round scones. Place scones on a greased baking sheet. Brush with milk and sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar mixture.
4. Bake in preheated oven until risen and golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes.
