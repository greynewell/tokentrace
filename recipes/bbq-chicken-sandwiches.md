## Ingredients

- 2 (4 pound) whole chickens, cut up
- 1 ½ cups ketchup
- ¾ cup prepared mustard
- 5 tablespoons brown sugar
- 5 tablespoons minced garlic
- 5 tablespoons honey
- ¼ cup steak sauce
- 4 tablespoons lemon juice
- 3 tablespoons liquid smoke flavoring
- salt and pepper to taste
- 12  hamburger buns
- 3 cups prepared coleslaw  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Place chicken into a large pot with enough water to cover; bring to a boil. Cook until chicken comes off the bone easily, about 3 hours.
2. While the chicken is cooking, combine ketchup, mustard, brown sugar, garlic, honey, steak sauce, lemon juice, and liquid smoke in a saucepan. Stir to combine, then season with salt and pepper. Bring mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside for flavors to mingle until chicken is ready.
3. Transfer cooked chicken to a cutting board. Remove meat and discard skin and bones. Chop or shred meat into small pieces.
4. Add chicken to sauce and stir to combine. Heat over medium-low until BBQ flavor soaks into chicken, about 15 minutes.
5. Spoon chicken onto buns and top with coleslaw.
