## Ingredients

- 1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ cup cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 tablespoons water, or as needed
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 ½ pounds onions, thinly sliced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1  small bay leaf
- 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme
- 1 tablespoon drained capers
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 20 large Niçoise olives, pitted and coarsely chopped
- 16 anchovies anchovy fillets

## Instructions

1. Mix flour and salt together in the bowl of a food processor. Add butter and 2 tablespoons oil. Pulse until mixture resembles coarse meal. Pulse in enough water, 1 tablespoon at a time, to form moist clumps. Gather dough into a ball; flatten into a disk. Wrap in plastic and chill, at least 2 hours.
2. Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a heavy, large skillet over medium-low heat. Add onions, garlic, bay leaf, and thyme; stir to blend. Cover and cook until onions are very tender, stirring occasionally, about 45 minutes. Uncover and sauté until most liquid evaporates and onions are golden, about 10 minutes longer. Stir in capers. Season mixture with salt and pepper. Cool completely; discard bay leaf.
3. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly oil a large baking sheet.
4. Roll out dough on a floured surface to an 11-inch round. Transfer dough to the prepared sheet. Crimp edges of dough to form a stand-up border. Spread filling evenly over dough. Arrange olives and anchovies decoratively atop filling.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until crust is crisp and golden, about 30 minutes. Transfer to a platter and serve.
