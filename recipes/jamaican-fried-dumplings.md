## Ingredients

- 4 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt
- ½ cup butter
- ½ cup cold water
- 1 cup vegetable oil for frying

## Instructions

1. Mix flour, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Rub in butter until the mixture is crumbly. Mix in water, 1 tablespoon at a time, to form a firm dough; knead briefly.
2. Heat oil in a large heavy skillet over medium heat.
3. Break off pieces of dough and shape them into biscuit-like patties. Place just enough of the dumplings into the hot oil so they are not crowded; fry until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Remove from the pan and drain on paper towels before serving.
