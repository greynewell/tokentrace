## Ingredients

- 5 ears corn, shucked
- 2 teaspoons olive oil
- 3 slices bacon, chopped
- ½ pound Yukon Gold potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
- 1  red bell pepper, cut into cubes
- salt to taste
- 1 small red onion, thinly sliced
- 1 tablespoon cider vinegar
- ½ teaspoon red pepper flakes, or more to taste

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the corn and cook until slightly soft but still crisp, about 5 minutes. Cut corn kernels from the cobs; discard cobs.
2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir bacon in hot oil until browned and crispy, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer bacon to a paper towel-lined plate to drain, reserving drippings in the skillet.
3. Cook potatoes, stirring occasionally, in the same skillet over medium heat until potatoes are golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add red bell pepper and salt; cook and stir until peppers are tender, about 5 minutes more.
4. Stir corn kernels into potato mixture and cook until corn is heated through, about 5 minutes.
5. Pour corn-potato mixture into a large bowl. Add bacon, red onion, cider vinegar, and red pepper flakes; toss to combine.
