## Ingredients

- 1 (15 ounce) package double crust ready-to-use pie crust
- 3 (15 ounce) cans pitted sour cherries, drained
- 3 tablespoons quick-cooking tapioca
- 1 ½ cups white sugar

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Press one pie crusts into a 9-inch pie plate.
3. Stir together cherries, tapioca, sugar, and almond extract in a bowl. Let the mixture stand for 3 to 5 minutes.
