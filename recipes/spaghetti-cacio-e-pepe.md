## Ingredients

- 1 pound spaghetti
- 6 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 teaspoons ground black pepper
- 1 ¾ cups grated Pecorino Romano cheese

2. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and pepper; cook and stir until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add spaghetti and Pecorino Romano cheese. Ladle in 1/2 cup of reserved cooking water; stir until cheese is melted, about 1 minute. Add more cooking water until sauce coats spaghetti, about 1 minute more.
