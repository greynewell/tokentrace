## Ingredients

- 2 cups water
- 1 cup long grain rice
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 small sweet onion, finely chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 small green bell pepper, chopped
- 1 small red bell pepper, chopped
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 tiny pinch salt
