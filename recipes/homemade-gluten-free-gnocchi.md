## Ingredients

- 1 ½ pounds potatoes
- 1  egg at room temperature, lightly beaten
- ⅓ cup potato starch
- 1 tablespoon sweet rice flour
- ½ teaspoon fine salt
- 2 tablespoons rice flour, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Prick each potato a few times with a fork and place on a baking sheet.
2. Bake in the preheated oven until tender when pierced with a knife, about 50 minutes. Cool until easily handled, about 10 minutes.
3. Peel potatoes and pass through a ricer or food mill into a large bowl. Make a well in the mashed potatoes with a wooden spoon and pour in egg; mix well.
4. Whisk potato starch, sweet rice flour, and salt together in a bowl. Sprinkle over potato mixture; stir until a soft dough has formed. Cut dough into 4 equal parts with a knife or pastry cutter.
5. Dust work surface with rice flour to keep dough from sticking. Roll out 1 piece of dough into a rope about 1 inch in diameter. Cut into 1-inch gnocchi. Gently roll each one with the back of a fork to create ridges. Repeat with remaining dough.
6. Shake off any excess rice flour and let gnocchi rest, about 5 minutes.
7. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add gnocchi in batches and cook, without stirring, until they float to the top, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon.
