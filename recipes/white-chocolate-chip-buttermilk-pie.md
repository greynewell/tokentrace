## Ingredients

- 1 (15 ounce) package prepared 9-inch pie crusts
- 1 ¼ cups white sugar
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon finely grated orange zest
- 2 cups buttermilk
- 5 large eggs, beaten
- 1 tablespoon orange blossom water
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ¼ cup butter
- ½ cup white chocolate chips
- ¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line two 9-inch pie plates with pie crusts.
2. Parbake the crusts in the preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, combine sugar, flour, and orange zest in a mixing bowl. Add buttermilk, beaten eggs, orange blossom water, and vanilla.
4. Melt butter in a small saucepan over low heat, 3 to 5 minutes. Mix into the buttermilk filling until well incorporated.
5. Sprinkle 1/4 cup white chocolate chips over the bottom of each pie crust. Divide the filling between the crusts. Sprinkle the tops lightly with cinnamon. Cover edges with foil so crusts don't burn.
6. Bake pies in the preheated oven until the filling is set, 35 to 40 minutes. Allow the pies to cool and refrigerate until firm, 8 hours to overnight. Serve chilled for best flavor.
