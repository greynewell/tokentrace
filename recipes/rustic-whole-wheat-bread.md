## Ingredients

- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 3 cups whole wheat flour
- ¼ cup brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons instant yeast
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt
- 3 ½ cups warm water (110 to 120 degrees F)
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil

## Instructions

1. Stir together all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, brown sugar, instant yeast, and salt in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. Whisk together water and oil in a cup; pour into flour mixture. Mix on low speed until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl into a ball.
2. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface; knead just until dough is smooth, about 1 minute. Divide and shape dough into 3 balls for small loaves or 2 balls for larger loaves. Dust loaves with flour and place onto a baking sheet. Cover with a towel and let rise until doubled in size, about 25 minutes.
3. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Slash an "X" about 1/4-inch deep in tops of loaves with a sharp knife.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until loaves are golden brown and sound hollow when tapped, about 25 minutes. Remove from the oven; transfer loaves to a wire rack to cool completely.
