## Ingredients

- 6 ounces crumbled blue cheese
- 1 (4 ounce) package cream cheese
- kosher salt to taste
- freshly ground black pepper to taste
- ⅓ cup heavy whipping cream

## Instructions

1. Puree blue cheese and cream cheese together in a food processor until completely smooth; transfer to a bowl and season with kosher salt and black pepper.
2. Beat heavy cream in a glass or metal bowl until soft peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the whipped cream will form soft mounds rather than a sharp peak. Fold whipped cream into the blue cheese mixture, stirring until the mixture is creamy with no lumps.
3. Transfer mixture to a pastry bag with a round tip for piping.
