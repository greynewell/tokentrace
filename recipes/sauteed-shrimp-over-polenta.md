## Ingredients

- 2 ½ cups chicken stock, or as needed, divided
- ¾ cup fat-free half-and-half
- 1 cup polenta

## Instructions

1. Heat 2 cups chicken stock and half-and-half until nearly boiling. Add polenta and stir constantly until no clumps remain, 3 to 4 minutes. Reduce heat and simmer until tender and thickened, 20 to 30 minutes. Add additional stock or water if polenta is too thick.
