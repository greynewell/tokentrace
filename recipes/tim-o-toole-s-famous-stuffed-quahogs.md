## Ingredients

- 4 cups water
- 1 (16 ounce) package Portuguese chourico sausage links
- 12  quahogs
- 1 large onion, coarsely chopped
- 1 (12 ounce) package chicken-flavored bread stuffing mix (such as Kraft® Stove Top®)
- ½ cup margarine
- ¼ cup butter

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Bring water to a boil over high heat. Add sausage links; reduce heat to medium and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove links from broth; reserve the broth. Remove casings from the sausage.
3. Bring the broth back to a simmer and add the quahogs; cook until they open, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove the quahogs; reserve the broth. Remove the cooked quahogs from the shells. Separate the shell halves. If necessary wash the shells.
4. Place the sausage and quahog meat into the bowl of a food processor; process until chopped, about 12 seconds, depending on your processor. Scrape mixture into a bowl. Add chopped onion to the processor; chop about 5 seconds. Stir in to the meat mixture.
5. Make the full container of stuffing according to package directions, using the margarine, and substituting the sausage/clam broth for water. There may be more broth than you need.
6. Mix together the stuffing and sausage/clam/onion mixture. Spoon filling into empty clam shell halves and top each with a small pat of butter (about a third of a teaspoon).
7. Place the shells on a baking pan; bake in the preheated oven until toasty brown on top, 15 to 20 minutes.
