## Ingredients

- 3 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
- ¾ cup milk
- ¾ cup white sugar
- ¼ cup butter
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 2  eggs
- 2 quarts oil for deep frying
- 1 cup confectioners' sugar for dusting

## Instructions

1. Combine 1 3/4 cups flour with yeast in a large bowl. Heat milk, sugar, butter, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat until butter melts. Add milk mixture and eggs to flour mixture; beat with a heavy-duty electric mixer on low speed until just combined, about 30 seconds. Increase speed to high and beat for 3 minutes. Add remaining flour, a little at a time, stirring with a spoon until a firm but pliable dough forms.
2. Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface. Knead until smooth and supple, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer to an oiled bowl. Cover and let dough rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
3. Turn dough out onto a floured surface, punch down dough, and roll out to 1/2-inch thickness. Cut out doughnuts with a floured doughnut cutter; re-roll trimmings and cut them into doughnuts. Transfer doughnuts to baking sheets, cover, and let rise for 45 minutes.
4. Heat oil in a deep fryer to 360 degrees F (180 degrees C).
5. Working in batches, fry doughnuts in hot oil, turning several times, until golden all over. Use a slotted spoon to remove doughnuts to a wire rack to drain and cool completely.
6. Dredge cooled doughnuts in confectioners' sugar.
