## Ingredients

- 1 (4 ounce) filet mignon
- ⅓ teaspoon salt
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 sprigs fresh thyme
- ¾ cup olive oil, or as needed
- 1 tablespoon olive oil

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).
2. Pat filet dry. Season evenly with salt.
3. Place steak into a small glass dish, about the size of the steak. Press minced garlic on top of the steak and lay thyme sprigs on top. Pour enough olive oil on top so the steak is immersed in oil.
4. Cook steak in the preheated oven until the internal temperature is 135 degrees F (57 degrees C), about 40 minutes.
5. Remove steak from oven and blot dry.
6. Preheat a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Pour 1 tablespoon olive oil into the skillet and sear steak in the hot oil for 30 to 40 seconds on each side, including the sides. Slice and serve immediately.
