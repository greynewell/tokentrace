## Ingredients

- 1 cup orange juice
- ½ cup lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 1 tablespoon onion powder
- 1 tablespoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- 8 large large scallops
- 2  yellow squash, cut into 4 large chunks
- 2  zucchinis, cut into 4 large chunks
- 1 (8 ounce) package portobello mushroom caps, cut into large chunks
- 4  bamboo skewers, soaked in water for 60 minutes
- ½ cup fresh basil
- 2 large tomatoes, cored
- 1 (12 ounce) package microwaveable broccoli in cheese sauce
- 1 ½ cups cooked brown rice
- 1 slice American cheese, cut into 4 strips

## Instructions

1. Whisk orange juice, lemon juice, salt, onion powder, garlic powder, black pepper, and sugar together in a large bowl to dissolve seasoning into the liquid. Add scallops, yellow squash, zucchinis, and portobello mushroom to the mojito marinade; toss to coat.
2. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate 8 hours to overnight.
3. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
4. Thread onto a skewer a piece of mushroom, yellow squash, zucchini, and a scallop, respectively. Repeat so there are two of each item on the skewer; repeat with remaining skewers. Sprinkle fresh basil evenly over the skewers.
5. Carefully remove tomato insides with a spoon; discard tomato insides.
6. Pour broccoli with cheese sauce into a microwave-safe bowl; cook in microwave until broccoli is tender and the sauce is melted, 3 to 5 minutes.
7. Stir broccoli with cheese sauce and rice together in a bowl; spoon into the hollowed-out tomatoes. Place 2 strips American cheese atop the mixture in a crossing pattern.
8. Cook the skewers in preheated oven until the scallops are cooked through, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from oven to a plate; cover with aluminum foil to keep warm.
9. Reduce oven heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
10. Bake tomatoes in the oven until the cheese is bubbling, 5 to 10 minutes. Serve with the skewers.
