## Ingredients

- ½ cup finely crushed buttery crackers (such as Ritz®)
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®)
- 2 tablespoons butter, melted
- 1 pound sea scallops, patted dry
- 1  serving cooking spray

## Instructions

1. Preheat the air fryer to 390 degrees F (198 degrees C).
2. Mix cracker crumbs, garlic powder, and seafood seasoning together in a shallow bowl. Place melted butter in a second shallow bowl.
3. Dip each scallop in the melted butter and then roll in the breading until completely coated. Set on a plate and repeat with the remaining scallops.
4. Lightly spray the air fryer basket with cooking spray. Arrange scallops in the prepared basket so that they are not touching each other; you may need to work in batches.
5. Cook in the preheated air fryer for 2 minutes. Turn scallops over gently with a small spatula and cook until opaque, about 2 more minutes.
