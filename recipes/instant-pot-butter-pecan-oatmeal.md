## Ingredients

- ½ cup rolled oats
- 1 ½ cups water, divided
- 2/3 cup butter pecan-flavored coffee creamer
- ½ teaspoon cinnamon sugar
- 1 pinch salt
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
- ¼ cup chopped pecans
- 1 pinch of cinnamon sugar

## Instructions

1. Pour 1 cup water into a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®). Set an elevated trivet inside.
2. Combine oats, remaining water, coffee creamer, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon sugar, and salt in a small heat resistant bowl. Set onto the trivet.
3. Close and lock the lid. Select porridge setting according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 5 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
4. Meanwhile, melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add pecans and sprinkle with cinnamon sugar. Allow butter to brown and nuts to toast, about 1 minute depending on size of pecan pieces. Remove from heat.
5. Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 12 minutes. Release remaining pressure carefully using the quick-release method, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Spoon oatmeal into 2 bowls and top with equal amounts of toasted pecans. Serve immediately.
