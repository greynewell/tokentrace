## Ingredients

- 1 small head cauliflower
- ¼ cup olive oil
- ½ stick unsalted butter
- ground black pepper to taste
- 2 slices Gouda cheese
- 2 slices sharp Cheddar cheese
- 2 slices beefsteak tomato

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Remove the tough bottom leaves from the cauliflower, taking care not to remove the stem. Place on a cutting board with the stem facing upwards; cut vertically on both sides of the stem to remove the loose florets. Reserve florets for another use. Cut vertically through the stem into 2 even "steaks", about 1 inch thick. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet.
3. Roast cauliflower in the preheated oven until soft and browned, about 15 minutes.
4. Heat olive oil and butter in a large frying pan. Cook cauliflower until browned on one side, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip cauliflower and shift to one side of the pan so you have space to warm cheese slices.
5. Lay cheese slices in the pan until they begin to melt, then place over the cauliflower steaks. Warm tomato slices in the same way. Season with black pepper. Cover cheeses and tomatoes with the second steak. Flip "sandwich" and cook over low heat until cheeses are melted, 2 to 3 minutes more.
