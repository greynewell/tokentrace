## Ingredients

- 4  eggs
- ¼ cup white sugar
- ¼ cup vegetable oil
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour, or as needed
- 2 cups vegetable oil for frying, or as needed
- ½ cup honey, or more to taste
- ½ cup white sugar, or more to taste
- 1 tablespoon rainbow nonpareil sprinkles, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Beat eggs, 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup vegetable oil, and vanilla extract together in a bowl; stir in baking powder. Slowly stir flour, about 1 tablespoon at a time, into egg mixture until a soft dough forms. Roll dough into small balls.
2. Heat 2 cups vegetable oil in a large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) or until you see little waves on the bottom of the saucepan.
3. Working in small batches, fry dough balls in hot oil until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes per batch. Transfer struffoli to a paper towel-lined plate using a slotted spoon.
4. Heat honey in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Slowly mix 1/2 cup sugar, a few tablespoons at a time, into honey until sugar is melted and glaze is smooth, about 5 minutes.
5. Transfer struffoli to a large bowl and pour glaze on top; toss quickly to evenly coat before glaze hardens.
6. Arrange struffoli into a tower shape or Christmas tree shape on a serving plate. Sprinkle nonpareil sprinkles over struffoli.
