## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 1 pound ground beef
- 1  onion, chopped
- 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ¾ cup milk
- ¾ cup ketchup
- ½ cup butter, melted
- 2  eggs, lightly beaten

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Spray 24 mini-muffin cups with cooking spray.
2. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef and onions in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain excess fat and set aside to cool.
