## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 3  green onions
- 1 (10 ounce) can mushroom pieces, drained
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch
- ½ cup half-and-half
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 pinch garlic powder, or to taste
- 10 slices sandwich bread

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray.
2. Chop green onions and mushrooms very finely, to a nearly paste-like consistency.
3. Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat; stir in green onions and mushrooms and cook and stir until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Whisk cornstarch into half-and-half; pour into mushroom mixture and cook, stirring often, until thickened, about 3 minutes. Season mushroom mixture with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.
4. Roll bread slices with a rolling pin until very flat and thin. Spread mushroom mixture evenly onto flattened bread; tightly roll up bread slices. Slice each bread tube into 1-inch thick rounds; place rounds onto a baking sheet.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until bread is browned, about 10 minutes.
