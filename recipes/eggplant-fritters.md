## Ingredients

- 1 large eggplant, sliced very thinly
- sea salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 cup almond meal
- 1 cup finely grated Parmesan cheese
- ½ cup toasted sesame seeds
- 3  eggs, lightly beaten
- 2 tablespoons grapeseed oil for frying

## Instructions

1. Place eggplant slices in a colander and sprinkle lightly with salt. Set aside.
2. Combine almond meal, Parmesan cheese, and sesame seeds in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Place beaten eggs in another bowl. Gently pat eggplant slices dry and dip first in eggs, shaking off excess, and then into almond meal mixture. Place breaded eggplant on a plate near the cooking area.
3. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
