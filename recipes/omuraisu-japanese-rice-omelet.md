## Ingredients

- 1 cup cooked white or brown rice
- 2 thin slices  cooked ham, cubed
- 2 tablespoons ketchup
- 1 slice processed cheese food (such as Velveeta ®)  (Optional)
- 2  eggs
- salt and pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon ketchup
- ¼ teaspoon chopped fresh parsley

## Instructions

1. Heat a skillet over medium heat, and coat with cooking spray. Add the cooked rice, 2 tablespoons ketchup, ham, and cheese, if using. Cook and stir until the ingredients are well combined and heated through, about 8 minutes. Scoop the mixture onto a serving bowl and shape into an oval.
2. In a bowl, beat eggs and salt and pepper. Heat a small skillet coated with cooking spray over medium heat. Add egg mixture; cook over medium heat. As eggs set, lift edges, letting uncooked portion flow underneath. Use a spatula to gently fold the eggs into a cocoon shape. When eggs are completely set, remove from the heat.
3. Place the omelet on top of the rice and run a knife length-wise through the top layer of the omelet. It should open like a butterfly and drape over the rice. Top with the final tablespoon of ketchup and a sprinkle of parsley.
