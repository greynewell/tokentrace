## Ingredients

- 1 (10 pound) bone-in standing rib roast
- 2 tablespoons kosher salt
- ½ cup butter, softened
- 3 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme
- ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Season roast generously with kosher salt. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.
2. Remove roast from the refrigerator and allow to come to room temperature, about 2 hours.
3. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).
4. Mix butter, rosemary, thyme, and black pepper together in a small bowl; spread butter mixture over roast. Place roast in a large roasting pan.
5. Bake roast in the preheated oven until internal temperature reaches 115 degrees F (46 degrees C) for medium-rare, about 3 1/2 hours. Remove from the oven and tent with aluminum foil; allow to rest, about 20 minutes.
6. Meanwhile, increase the oven temperature to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).
7. Once the oven has come up to temperature, uncover rested roast and return it to the oven. Bake until well-browned, 6 to 10 minutes. Slice and serve.
