## Ingredients

- 1 pound chestnuts
- ¼ cup butter
- salt to taste
- 1 pinch ground cinnamon

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Wash and dry chestnuts. Place flat-side down on a cutting board. Using a paring knife, score a large "X" on the rounded side, covering at least half of the chestnut. Make sure the knife goes through the outer skin and the brown layer underneath. This will aid peeling after being roasted. Place nuts in a shallow baking pan.
3. Bake in the preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes. Remove, leaving the oven on, and allow them to cool; peel off the shells.
4. Place nuts in a skillet with butter; sauté over high heat until butter is melted and chestnuts are well coated. Return skillet to oven and roast until they are golden on top. Sprinkle with cinnamon and salt.
