## Ingredients

- ⅓ cup apricot preserves
- ⅓ cup fruity white wine, such as Gewurztraminer
- ½ teaspoon ground ginger
- salt and pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 4  boneless pork chops, 1/2 inch thick

## Instructions

1. Mix the apricot preserves, wine, and ground ginger together in a small bowl; set aside.
2. Season the pork chops with salt and pepper. Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium high heat. Add the pork chops and cook until brown on each side, and no longer pink in the center, about 4 minutes per side. Remove chops from the skillet. Reduce heat to medium low. Using the same skillet, pour in the apricot preserves mixture and simmer until thickened, about 4 minutes. Return pork chops to the skillet, turning to coat each side in the sauce; cook 1 minute.
