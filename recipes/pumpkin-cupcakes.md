## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice
- 1 ½ teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- 1 cup whole milk
- ¼ cup maple syrup
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- ¾ cup butter, softened
- ½ cup white sugar
- ½ cup dark brown sugar
- 3  eggs
- 1 cup canned pumpkin
- 1 cup butter, softened
- 1 tablespoon half-and-half
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 6 cups confectioners' sugar, or more as needed
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or more to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 22 muffin cups with paper liners.
2. Combine flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking powder, and baking soda in a medium bowl. Combine milk, maple syrup, and vanilla in another medium bowl; stir gently to combine.
3. Combine butter, white sugar, and brown sugar in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until smooth. Mix in eggs, one at a time, until well blended, scraping down the bowl as necessary. Add flour mixture in 3 batches, alternating with milk mixture, beating batter briefly after each addition. Add pumpkin; mix until smooth and well combined. Divide batter evenly between the prepared muffin cups.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until a cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 17 to 20 minutes. Cool in the tins for 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
5. Meanwhile, combine butter, half-and-half, and vanilla extract for the frosting in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until creamy. Add confectioners' sugar, 1 cup at a time, and mix on the lowest setting until frosting reaches a good spreading consistency. Mix in cinnamon and spread on cooled cupcakes.
