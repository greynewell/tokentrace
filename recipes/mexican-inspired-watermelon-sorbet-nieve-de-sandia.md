## Ingredients

- 7 ½ cups seedless watermelon, chopped into chunks, divided
- 1 ½ cups white sugar
- 3  limes, juiced, or more to taste
- 4 tablespoons chamoy (Mexican chili fruit condiment), or more to taste  (Optional)
- 2 tablespoons chili-lime seasoning (such as Tajin®)  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Place 2 1/2 cups watermelon into an electric blender and liquefy. Transfer juice to a saucepan and add sugar and lime juice.

Chill and store simple syrup in a closed glass jar in the refrigerator.
2. Place remaining watermelon chunks on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper and freeze until solid, about 4 hours.
3. Add frozen watermelon pieces, a few at a time, to the bowl of a food processor and puree. Add 1/3 to 1/2 cup of the simple syrup mixture, followed by chamoy and chile-lime seasoning; process until smooth. Serve right away or store in an airtight plastic container in the freezer.
