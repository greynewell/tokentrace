## Ingredients

- 2 pounds chicken wings
- 3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
- 1 teaspoon garlic salt
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
- ½ teaspoon onion salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ cup all-purpose flour
- 1 cup shortening
- ½ cup butter
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- ½ cup hot pepper sauce, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Toss chicken wings in a large bowl with apple cider vinegar, garlic salt, paprika, red pepper flakes, onion salt, and black pepper to coat; cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for 1 to 4 hours.
2. Scatter flour over chicken wings; toss to coat. Discard any remaining marinade.
3. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
4. Heat shortening in a large skillet over medium-high heat; fry chicken in hot shortening until golden, 5 to 7 minutes per side. Transfer fried chicken to a baking sheet.
5. Bake chicken in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. Remove chicken to a paper towel-lined platter to drain.
6. Make sauce: Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook garlic in melted butter until translucent, about 2 minutes. Stir hot sauce into butter-garlic mixture; reduce heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes. Transfer sauce to a large bowl.
7. Working in batches, add chicken to sauce in the bowl and turn to coat. Drizzle any remaining sauce over wings to serve.
