## Instructions

1. Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.

3. Whisk in flour and stir until slightly brown, about 3 minutes.
4. Whisk in milk; bring to a boil, stirring constantly.
5. Once boiling, reduce heat immediately and simmer for 5 minutes.
6. Add 1/2 of the Gruyere cheese, salt, pepper, and nutmeg; heat until cheese is melted, about 2 minutes.

11. Transfer all 4 pieces to a baking sheet.
12. Broil in the preheated oven until cheese is almost melted, 2 to 3 minutes.
13. Remove from the oven, place toast slices together to make 2 sandwiches and pour remaining cheese sauce on top of each sandwich.
14. Return to the broiler until sauce starts to brown, about 2 minutes.
