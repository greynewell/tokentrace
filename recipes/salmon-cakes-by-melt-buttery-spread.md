3. Add salmon skin side down, turn off the heat, cover, and let salmon cook gently in the hot liquid for 10 minutes.
4. Using a metal spatula, transfer salmon to a plate skin side up and let cool. (The salmon should still be rare in the middle.) Peel off and discard salmon skin.

8. Spoon some of the salmon mixture into a 1/3-cup measuring cup and gently pack it with your hands.

10. Repeat to make 12 patties.
11. Refrigerate patties for at least 1 hour or overnight.
12. Add oil to a 12" cast-iron skillet until it reaches a depth of 1/2".
13. Heat over medium-high heat until oil registers 325 degrees  on a deep-fry thermometer.
