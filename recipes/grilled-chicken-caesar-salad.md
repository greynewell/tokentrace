## Ingredients

- ½ cup freshly shredded Parmesan cheese, divided
- ¼ cup olive oil
- ¾ (2 ounce) can anchovies, drained
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 large egg
- ½ medium lemon, juiced
- 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
- ¼ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
- ¼ teaspoon dry mustard
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ⅛ teaspoon prepared horseradish
- 1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into bite-size pieces
- 1 head romaine lettuce, shredded
- ½ cup Caesar salad croutons

## Instructions

1. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
2. Combine 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, olive oil, anchovies, garlic, egg, lemon juice, red wine vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, salt, pepper, and horseradish in a blender; blend until smooth.
3. Set dressing aside.
4. Cook chicken on the preheated grill, flipping halfway through, until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 10 minutes.
5. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
