## Ingredients

- 2 bunches beet greens, stems removed
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, or to taste
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- ¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes  (Optional)
- salt to taste
- freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 2  lemons, quartered

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add beet greens and cook, uncovered, until tender, about 2 minutes. Drain in a colander, then immediately immerse in ice water for several minutes to stop the cooking process. Once the greens are cold, drain well, and coarsely chop.
2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in garlic and red pepper flakes; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in the chopped greens until coated, then season with salt and pepper. Cook just until greens are hot; 1 to 2 minutes.
3. Serve with lemon wedges.
