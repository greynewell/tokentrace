## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1  onion, quartered
- 1  apple, cut into chunks
- 3 stalks celery, chopped
- 2 cups chicken broth
- 1 (.87 ounce) package turkey gravy mix
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt
- 2 teaspoons dried thyme
- 2 teaspoons dried rosemary
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon dried sage
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 (3 pound) frozen boneless turkey breast (such as Butterball®)
- 1 cup water
- ½ cup quick-mixing flour (such as Wondra®)

## Instructions

1. Turn on a multi-cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and the select Saute function. Melt butter in the pot. Saute onion, apple, and celery until onion and celery are slightly translucent, about 5 minutes. Add broth; scrape off bits from the bottom of the pot. Add gravy mix; stir until dissolved.
2. Combine kosher salt, thyme, rosemary, black pepper, sage, and garlic powder in a small bowl. Rub onto the turkey breast.
3. Lower a trivet into the pot; place seasoned turkey on top. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 50 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
4. Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, 10 to 40 minutes.
5. Mix water and quick-mixing flour together slowly in a bowl until slurry is smooth.
6. Unlock the lid and open the pot; transfer turkey to a plate. Strain the liquid from the pot; return it to the pot and select Saute function. Bring to a boil. Stir in the slurry slowly until gravy is thickened to your satisfaction. Slice turkey and serve with gravy.
