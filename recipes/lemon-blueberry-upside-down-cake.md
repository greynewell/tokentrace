## Ingredients

- 8 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided, at room temperature
- 1 cup white sugar, divided
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon allspice
- 2 (6 ounce) containers fresh blueberries
- 1 large egg
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- lemon, juiced
- ½ teaspoon lemon zest
- 1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ teaspoons baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ½ cup milk

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Rub 2 tablespoons butter over the bottom and sides of an 8-inch round cake pan.
2. Whisk 1/2 cup sugar, cinnamon, and allspice together in a small bowl. Sprinkle evenly over the bottom and sides of the cake pan. Arrange blueberries evenly over the bottom.
3. Combine remaining butter and sugar in a large bowl. Beat with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add egg and vanilla extract; beat well. Beat in lemon juice and zest on low speed.
4. Mix flour, baking powder, and salt together in another bowl. Add to the butter mixture in 3 batches, alternating with milk, beating on low speed after each addition until batter is well combined.
5. Spoon batter smoothly and evenly over the blueberries in the pan. Place pan on a baking sheet.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Let cool completely on a wire rack, about 20 minutes. Run a knife around the edge of the cake and invert onto a rimmed platter or serving dish.
