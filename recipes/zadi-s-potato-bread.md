## Ingredients

- 4 cups water
- ⅓ cup butter
- ⅓ cup white sugar
- ¼ cup dry buttermilk powder
- 4 teaspoons salt
- 2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
- 1 cup instant mashed potato flakes
- 10 cups bread flour, divided

## Instructions

1. Bring the water, butter, sugar, buttermilk powder, and salt to a simmer in a saucepan over low heat. Remove from the heat, mix well, and let cool to between 105 and 110 degrees F (41 to 43 degrees C). Sprinkle the yeast on top of the mixture, and let stand for about 10 minutes, until the yeast begins to form a creamy foam. Stir in the instant mashed potato flakes, and mix well.
2. Pour the yeast mixture into the work bowl of a standing mixer with a dough paddle, and slowly incorporate 8 cups of bread flour into the liquid, adding the flour 1 cup at a time.
3. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface, and knead for about 8 minutes, adding the remaining flour to the dough as you knead. When the dough is smooth and elastic, form into a ball, and place into a large greased bowl. Turn the dough over in the bowl to grease the top, cover with a cloth, and let rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, until doubled.
4. Spray 2 9x5 inch loaf pans with cooking spray. Punch the dough down, divide into two pieces, and shape each piece into a loaf shape. Place the loaves in the baking pans, seam sides down, cover with a cloth, and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 30 minutes.
5. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
6. Bake bread for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until the tops are golden brown and the loaves sound hollow when tapped. Remove from pans to a wire rack to cool.
