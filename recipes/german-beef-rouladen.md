## Ingredients

- ¼ cup Dijon mustard
- 8 (4 ounce) pieces round steak, pounded 1/4 inch thick
- ½ cup minced onion
- 2 teaspoons paprika
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
- 8 slices bacon
- 3 tablespoons canola oil
- 1 (12 ounce) can beef broth
- 1 ¼ cups water
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch
- 1 cup warm water
- ¼ cup sour cream

## Instructions

1. Spread 1/2 tablespoon mustard over one side of each piece of steak; sprinkle onion, paprika, salt, and pepper evenly over the steaks. Lay one slice of bacon on each piece; roll up steaks jelly roll-style and secure with toothpicks.
2. Heat canola oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook beef rouladen on all sides until browned. Add broth and water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; cover and simmer until tender, about 30 minutes.
3. Remove beef rouladen; strain broth mixture and return liquid to the skillet. Whisk cornstarch and 1 cup of water together until smooth; slowly pour cornstarch mixture into the skillet, stirring continually until the sauce has thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in sour cream; return rolls to the sauce and serve immediately.
