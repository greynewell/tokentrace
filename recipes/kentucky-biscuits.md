## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 ½ teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- 1 dash salt
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- ½ cup butter
- ¾ cup buttermilk

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. In a bowl, mix the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and sugar. Cut in 1/2 cup butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Mix in the buttermilk. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead 2 minutes. Transfer to an ungreased baking sheet, roll into a 6x6 inch square, and cut into 12 even sections. Do not separate.
3. Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until a knife inserted in the center of the square comes out clean. Separate into biscuits, and serve hot.
