- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- ½  white onion, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon capers
- 1 tablespoon caper juice
- 1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
- ⅓ cup pitted, sliced green olives (such as Castelvetrano)

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in onion; cook and stir until onions begin to turn translucent, 6 to 7 minutes.
3. Cook and stir in garlic until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add capers and caper juice; stir to combine.
4. Stir in tomatoes, olives, jalapeno pepper, . Cook and stir until jalapeno pepper softens and tomatoes begin to collapse, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in oregano.
5. Drizzle 1 teaspoon olive oil into a small baking dish. Sprinkle in 1 tablespoon of the tomato-olive mixture. Top with 1 snapper fillet, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper.
