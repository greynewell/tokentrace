## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 ⅓ cups fresh cranberries
- ¾ cup orange juice
- ½ cup white sugar
- ⅓ cup butter, melted, cooled
- 1  egg
- 1  orange, zested
- 1 cup powdered sugar
- 1 tablespoon orange juice, or more as needed
- 1 pinch grated orange zest

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners.
2. Mix together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Mix in cranberries.
3. Whisk together orange juice, sugar, melted butter, egg, and orange zest in a separate bowl. Add orange juice mixture to flour mixture, stirring just until moistened; do not overmix. Spoon into the prepared muffin cups.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned and firm to the touch, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool in the tin for 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool, about 20 minutes.
5. Meanwhile, mix together powdered sugar, 1 tablespoon orange juice, and orange zest for glaze. Add more orange juice, if necessary, to reach desired consistency. Drizzle glaze over cooled muffins.
