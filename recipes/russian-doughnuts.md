## Ingredients

- 9 ounces farmer's cheese
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 2  eggs
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract, or to taste  (Optional)
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- oil for frying
- 1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar, or to taste  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Mix farmer's cheese, flour, eggs, sugar, vanilla extract, and salt together in a bowl until a sticky dough forms.
2. Roll dough into 1-inch balls with wet hands to prevent sticking.
3. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or heavy saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). The oil should be hot but not smoking. It is ready for frying if you see little air bubbles around a wooden spoon placed in the oil.
4. Fry a batch of the dough balls in the hot oil until golden, about 2 minutes. Place doughnuts on paper towels to soak up excess oil. Repeat with remaining dough. Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar.
