## Ingredients

- 24  vanilla wafers (such as Nilla®)
- 1 (18.25 ounce) package vanilla cake mix (such as Duncan Hines®)
- 1 cup water
- 3  eggs
- ⅓ cup vegetable oil
- 1 cup mashed ripe bananas
- 1 ⅔ cups crushed vanilla wafers (such as Nilla®), divided
- 1 cup vanilla pudding
- ½ cup thinly sliced ripe banana
- 1 cup sweetened whipped cream, or more to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 muffin tins with cupcake liners.
2. Place 1 vanilla wafer flat-side down in the bottom of each cupcake liner.
3. Blend vanilla cake mix, water, eggs, and vegetable oil in a large bowl with an electric mixer on low speed until moistened, about 30 seconds. Beat at medium speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. Fold in mashed bananas and 1 cup crushed wafers. Scoop batter into prepared tins.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 18 to 20 minutes. Transfer cupcakes to a wire rack to cool, about 30 minutes.
5. Combine vanilla pudding and sliced banana in a small bowl.
