## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons kosher salt
- 1 tablespoon black peppercorns
- 1 wine cork
- 3 ½ pounds octopus, head and beak removed
- 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- ½  lemon
- ½ tablespoon minced fresh parsley
- 1 pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Fill a large pot 1/2 full with water. Add 2 tablespoons kosher salt, peppercorns, and the wine cork; bring to a boil over high heat.
2. Meanwhile, place octopus on a cutting board. Using a wooden spoon or meat mallet, pound the octopus multiple times, starting in the middle and moving down each tentacle to tenderize the meat.
3. Dip tentacles into the boiling water 3 times, holding them in the boiling water 2 to 3 seconds each time, until the tentacles curl up. Submerge entire octopus in the boiling water. Bring water back to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until octopus is fork-tender, 45 to 60 minutes. Remove from heat and cool for 30 minutes.
4. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
5. Grill octopus until charred on all sides, 3 to 4 minutes per side.
6. Remove from heat, slice into pieces, and place on a serving platter. Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and squeeze lemon over the top. Sprinkle with parsley and season with salt and pepper. Serve immediately.
