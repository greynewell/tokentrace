## Ingredients

- 6  sea scallops
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ½ tablespoon olive oil
- 1 teaspoon garlic, finely minced
- ¼ cup dry white wine
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 2 tablespoons butter
- ½ teaspoon dried parsley
- 1 pinch Cajun seasoning
- 1 tablespoon finely chopped green onion tops

## Instructions

1. Fill a medium pot with warm water, attach the sous vide and set temperature to 123 degrees F (51 degrees C) and timer to 30 minutes.
2. Remove the tough muscle from the side of the scallops, if present, and lightly season with salt and pepper. Transfer scallops in a resealable plastic bag and remove all the air using the water immersion method.
3. Place the scallops in the pot when the temperature has reached 123 degrees F (51 degrees C). Cook until timer goes off.
4. Remove scallops from the bag and pat dry; if scallops are wet, they will not sear well.
5. Heat oil in a small skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Add scallops and sear until lightly brown, about 2 minutes. Turn and cook for 1 more minute. Remove from skillet and move to a warmed dish.
6. Add garlic to skillet and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Deglaze skillet with white wine and lemon, scraping up any browned bits. Mix in parsley and Cajun seasoning; simmer sauce for 2 minutes. Stir in butter until just melted. Spoon sauce over scallops, sprinkle with green onion tops, and serve.
