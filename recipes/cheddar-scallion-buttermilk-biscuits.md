## Ingredients

- 2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon grill seasoning (such as McCormick® Grill Mates® Montreal Steak Seasoning)
- ¼ teaspoon baking soda
- ¾ cup cold, unsalted butter, shredded on a box grater
- 1 ¼ cups buttermilk
- ¾ cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
- ¼ cup minced green onion, white and green parts
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.
2. Whisk flour, baking powder, salt, steak seasoning, and baking soda together in a large bowl. Add shredded butter and blend with your fingertips until the mixture is crumbly.
3. Gradually pour buttermilk into the bowl, stirring with a stiff rubber spatula until you have a soft, moist dough that holds together. Fold in Cheddar cheese and scallions quickly, mixing just until all of the flour is incorporated.
4. Drop biscuit dough onto a large baking pan using a two-tablespoon cookie scoop, spacing them 3 to a row. Gently brush tops of biscuits with melted butter.
5. Bake until biscuits are cooked through and golden brown on the outside and nicely risen, 17 to 22 minutes. Let cool on the pan for about 5 minutes, and serve warm.
