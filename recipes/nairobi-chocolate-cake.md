## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon baking powder
- 1 ¾ cups white sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- ¾ cup water
- ¾ cup vegetable oil
- 3  eggs, room temperature
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ½ cup water

## Instructions

1. Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9-inch cake pans or line them with parchment paper.
2. Combine the flour, baking soda, baking powder, sugar, salt, cocoa powder, 3/4 cup water, and vegetable oil in a mixing bowl. Beat with an electric mixer on medium speed for 2 minutes. Add the eggs, vanilla extract, and 1/2 cup water and beat for another 2 minutes.
3. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pans. Bake in the preheated oven until the surface of the cake springs back when lightly pressed and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
