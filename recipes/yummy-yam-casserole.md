## Ingredients

- 4 pounds yams
- 2  eggs
- ¼ cup brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons butter, melted
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ⅛ teaspoon ground allspice
- ⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 6 ounces pecan halves
- ⅓ cup brown sugar
- ¼ cup melted butter

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Poke yams in several places with a fork, then cook them on high power in microwave oven until heated through and soft, about 20 minutes. When cooled, remove skins and place the yams in a large bowl.
3. Beat yams until smooth. Then beat in one egg at a time, blending after each addition. Stir in 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/8 cup melted butter, salt, cinnamon, allspice and nutmeg; beat until the mixture is light and fluffy.
4. Transfer mixture to an ungreased 3 quart casserole dish. Arrange the pecans in a single layer on top. Sprinkle with remaining brown sugar and drizzle 1/4 cup melted butter over the top.
5. Bake for 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until browned and bubbly.
