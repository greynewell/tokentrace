## Ingredients

- 1  red bell pepper
- 1  yellow bell pepper
- 1  orange bell pepper
- ¾ cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 5 leaves fresh basil leaves, finely sliced
- ½ teaspoon dried oregano
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper

## Instructions

1. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Reduce grill heat to medium.
2. Grill whole red, yellow, and orange bell peppers on the preheated grill until charred on all sides, turning about every 5 minutes. Place charred peppers in a resealable plastic bag and seal well. Allow peppers to cool in the bag.
