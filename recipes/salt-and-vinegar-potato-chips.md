## Ingredients

- 4  potatoes, thinly sliced
- cold water to cover
- 3 cups white vinegar
- 1 cup cold water
- 2 cups vegetable oil for frying

## Instructions

1. Put potato slices in a large bowl. Pour enough cold water over the potatoes to cover completely. Soak potatoes, gently agitating every 10 minutes, for 30 minutes; drain.
