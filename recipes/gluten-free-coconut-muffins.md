## Ingredients

- ¾ cup coconut flour, spooned and leveled
- 3 teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon baking soda
- 4 large eggs
- ¾ cup coconut milk
- ⅔ cup white sugar
- ¼ cup coconut oil, melted
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 ¼ cups shredded unsweetened coconut, divided

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 12 muffin cups with paper liners.
2. Sift coconut flour together with baking powder, salt, and baking soda into a bowl and set aside.
3. Whisk eggs, coconut milk, sugar, coconut oil, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until smooth and creamy. Add flour mixture to the wet ingredients and mix until well combined. Let sit for 5 minutes to allow the coconut flour to absorb the liquid.
4. Fold 1 cup coconut flakes into the batter. Distribute the batter evenly among the prepared cups, filling them 2/3 of the way full. Sprinkle the remaining 1/4 cup coconut flakes over the tops of the muffins.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until the tops are golden and a toothpick inserted into the center of one of the muffins comes out clean, 18 to 20 minutes.
6. Cool muffins in the pan on a wire rack for 5 minutes before removing them to continue cooling directly on the wire rack.
