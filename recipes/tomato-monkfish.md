## Ingredients

- 6 medium tomatoes, chopped
- ½ cup olive oil
- 1 ½ tablespoons salted butter
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 1  green chile pepper, finely chopped
- 1 clove garlic, crushed
- 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger
- 1 tablespoon vinegar
- 2 teaspoons chopped fresh oregano
- 2 teaspoons chopped fresh parsley
- 2 teaspoons chopped fresh cilantro
- 1 cube chicken bouillon
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 (10 ounce) monkfish fillet, cut into 2 portions

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place tomatoes on a baking tray and drizzle with olive oil.
2. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, melt butter in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add onion, chile pepper, garlic, and ginger; fry until golden brown and slightly charred, about 10 minutes.
4. Remove tomatoes from the oven and add to the frying pan, including oil from the baking tray. Add vinegar, oregano, parsley, cilantro, bouillon cube, salt, and pepper. Continue to fry until tomatoes reduce into more of a paste, about 5 minutes more.
5. Add monkfish and cover with excess paste, making sure fillets are completely surrounded. Reduce heat and cook until fish flakes easily with a fork, 5 to 10 minutes more. Serve immediately.
