## Ingredients

- ½ cup unsalted butter
- ½  yellow onion, finely chopped
- ½ cup all-purpose flour
- ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 pinch freshly grated nutmeg
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper
- 2 ½ cups whole milk
- 1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste
- 2 cups finely chopped, cooked chicken meat
- ½ cup finely chopped ham
- 2 tablespoons freshly chopped Italian parsley
- 1 cup all-purpose flour, or as needed for dredging
- 2  eggs, beaten
- 2 cups bread crumbs
- 2 cups vegetable oil for frying

## Instructions

1. Melt butter in pan over medium heat. Add onions; cook and stir until onions begin to turn translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in 1/2 cup flour and cook until flour loses its raw taste, 3 or 4 minutes. Add black pepper, nutmeg, and cayenne pepper; stir. Remove from heat.
2. Pour milk into butter-onion mixture to make the bechamel sauce. Whisk until incorporated. Return pan to medium-high heat and continue whisking until mixture thickens, 1 or 2 minutes; continue to cook and stir 3 or 4 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in salt.
3. Place chopped chicken, ham, and parsley in bowl. Add bechamel sauce and mix thoroughly. Allow mixture to cool to room temperature; cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, 2 or 3 hours.
4. Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
5. Place 1 cup flour, beaten eggs, and bread crumbs in 3 separate shallow bowls.
6. Scoop out chilled mixture into evenly-sized portions (about the size of a golf ball) to form croquettes. Roll balls first in flour, then in beaten eggs, and then in bread crumbs.
7. Fry croquettes in batches until crispy, about 4 minutes. Drain on paper towels and transfer to rack.
