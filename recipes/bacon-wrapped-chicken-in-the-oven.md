## Ingredients

- ¼ cup brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons smoked paprika
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon black pepper
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon onion powder
- 4 (4 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- 1 (16 ounce) package bacon
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Mix brown sugar, paprika, garlic powder, pepper, salt, and onion powder together in a small bowl. Rub 1/2 of the spice mix over chicken breasts.
3. Wrap each breast with 2 to 4 slices of bacon, depending on size. Place in a baking dish and sprinkle remaining spice mix over top.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until bacon is crispy and chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 25 to 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
5. Serve topped with parsley.
