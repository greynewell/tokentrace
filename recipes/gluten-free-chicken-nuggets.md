## Ingredients

- 2 cups bite-size corn square cereal (such as Corn Chex®)
- 2  eggs
- ⅓ cup rice flour
- 4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into bite-size pieces
- ¼ cup oil for frying, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Blend cereal in a blender or food processor until it has the consistency of bread crumbs; pour into a bowl.
2. Beat eggs in a separate bowl until smooth. Pour rice flour into a third bowl.
3. Dredge chicken pieces in the rice flour, dip in beaten egg, and then press into the cereal to coat. Keep breaded chicken on a large plate until all are finished, but do not stack.
4. Pour enough oil into a large skillet to just cover the bottom and heat over medium-high heat.
5. Cook chicken nuggets in hot oil until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 2 to 3 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
