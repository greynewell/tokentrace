## Ingredients

- 2 cups warm water
- 2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
- ½ cup white sugar, divided
- ¼ cup vegetable oil, or more as needed
- 1 large egg
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 6 ½ cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed
- ½ cup unsalted butter, melted
- ½ cup white sugar, or more to taste
- ¼ cup ground cinnamon, or more to taste
- ½ cup chopped pecans, or to taste
- Topping:
- 1 cup powdered sugar
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 tablespoon milk, or more as needed
- 2 tablespoons chopped pecans, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Combine water, yeast, and 1 tablespoon sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Let sit until foamy, about 5 minutes.
2. Add remaining sugar, 1/4 cup oil, egg, and salt; mix until combined. Scrape paddle attachment and switch to the dough hook. Mix in flour, 1 cup at a time, until dough comes away from the sides of the bowl. Continue kneading for about 3 more minutes.
3. Add a bit of oil on the dough and roll the dough in the bowl until all sides are coated. Cover with a towel and let rise until at least doubled in size, about 45 minutes.
4. Punch down the dough and transfer to a floured surface. Roll out into a rectangle. Pour melted butter onto the dough and sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon to taste. Add pecans. Roll up lengthwise and cut into 12 rolls. Transfer to a greased 9x13-inch baking dish and let rise for 15 minutes.
5. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
6. Bake rolls in the preheated oven until golden brown in color, about 15 minutes.
7. While the rolls are baking, combine powdered sugar, melted butter, and vanilla for topping. Add 1 tablespoon milk and mix to a pourable consistency, adding more if necessary.
8. Remove rolls from the oven. Immediately pour topping over top and sprinkle with pecans.
