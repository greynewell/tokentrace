## Ingredients

- ¼ cup tapioca flour
- 2 tablespoons all purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons garlic salt
- 1 teaspoon Italian herbs
- 1 ½ pounds boneless skinless chicken thighs
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
- ¼ cup heavy cream
- ¼ cup milk
- 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 1 (16 ounce) bag fresh spinach
- 2 ounces shaved Pecorino Romano cheese

## Instructions

1. Combine tapioca flour, all purpose flour, garlic salt, and Italian herbs in a small bowl. Dredge chicken thighs through the mixture and shake off excess flour.
2. Heat olive oil and butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add chicken thighs and cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes on each side. Remove chicken from skillet.
3. Wipe out skillet, leaving just a little bit of the fond. Add minced garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour in tomato sauce, cream, and milk; stir to combine. Season with red pepper flakes and mix in spinach. Allow spinach to wilt, about 3 minutes. Return chicken thighs to the skillet and heat until warmed through. Serve topped with freshly shaved Pecorino Romano cheese.
