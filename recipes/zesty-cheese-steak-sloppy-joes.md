## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons salted butter
- 1 medium white onion, diced
- 1 medium green bell pepper, diced
- 2 pounds ground beef
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can beef broth
- ¼ cup steak sauce (such as A1®)
- 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
- 2 tablespoons minced pickled jalapeno peppers
- 1 tablespoon pickled jalapeno pepper juice
- 1 teaspoon Creole seasoning (such as Tony Chachere's®), or to taste
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch
- 2 tablespoons water
- 8 slices provolone cheese
- 1 (16 ounce) package wheat hamburger buns, split and toasted

## Instructions

1. Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion and bell pepper; saute until soft, 5 to 7 minutes. Add ground beef, garlic, salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper. Cook and stir until beef is browned and crumbly, 7 to 8 minutes. Drain and discard grease.
2. Add broth, steak sauce, Worcestershire sauce, jalapeno peppers and juice, and 1/2 teaspoon Creole seasoning; stir to combine, then bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, mix cornstarch and water together in a small bowl.
4. Add cornstarch slurry to beef mixture and cook to desired consistency, 1 to 2 minutes. Taste and add additional Creole seasoning and pepper if needed. Turn off heat.
5. Melt 1 slice of provolone cheese on top of the meat. Scoop the meat from under the provolone and place on a toasted bun. Repeat with remaining cheese and buns and serve immediately.
