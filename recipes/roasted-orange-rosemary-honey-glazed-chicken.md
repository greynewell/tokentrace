## Ingredients

- 8  large chicken legs
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 1 cup honey
- 1 cup orange juice with pulp
- ½ cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 7 sprigs fresh rosemary, finely chopped
- 2  oranges, zested
- 2 cloves garlic, minced  (Optional)
- ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Sprinkle chicken with salt and place in a large glass or plastic bowl.
2. Whisk together honey, orange juice, butter, rosemary, orange zest, and garlic. Pour orange mixture over chicken; cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour or overnight.
3. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
4. Place chicken legs in a single layer in a roasting pan; pour orange mixture over chicken.
5. Roast for 30 minutes in the preheated oven; reduce temperature to 325 degrees F (160 degrees C). Baste chicken with pan juices every 20 minutes until chicken is a deep orange brown color, no longer pink at the bone, and juices run clear, about 90 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the meat near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
