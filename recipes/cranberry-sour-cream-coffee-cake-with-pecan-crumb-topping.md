## Ingredients

- ½ cup light brown sugar
- ½ cup white sugar
- ½ cup all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 pinch salt
- ¼ cup cold unsalted butter
- ½ cup chopped pecans, or to taste
- 3 ⅔ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 1 cup white sugar
- ½ cup brown sugar
- ¾ cup sour cream
- 3 large eggs
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- 1 ¼ cups whole milk
- 2 cups chopped fresh cranberries

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and lightly flour a 9x13-inch baking pan.
2. Combine brown sugar, white sugar, flour, cinnamon, and salt for crumb topping in a medium bowl and toss lightly with a fork.
3. Grate the butter into the flour mixture using the largest side of a box grater. Combine with a fork or pastry knife until ingredients are combined and have the appearance of very coarse meal; the pieces should be loose and not sticking together. Stir in pecans and set topping aside.
4. Combine flour, baking powder, and salt for cake in a large bowl.
5. Combine butter, white sugar, and brown sugar in the bowl of an electric stand mixer. Beat on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add sour cream, eggs, and vanilla extract and mix, scraping the bowl as needed, for 1 minute. Add flour mixture on low speed in thirds, alternating with milk, ending with the flour mixture. Mix until just smooth. Stir in cranberries with a spoon.
6. Spread batter into the prepared baking pan and sprinkle topping evenly over the batter.
7. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 55 minutes. Cool in the pan on a wire rack for about 10 minutes. Serve warm.
