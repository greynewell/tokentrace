## Ingredients

- 1 ¼ cups buttermilk
- ¼ cup vegetable oil
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 dash salt
- 1  egg
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon butter, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Mix the buttermilk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract in a bowl; stir in the sugar. Whisk in the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt, combining the batter with just a few strokes to moisten. Leave the lumps.
2. In a separate bowl, whisk the egg and lemon juice together; gently stir into the batter. Refrigerate the batter for at least 30 minutes, up to 1 hour.
