## Ingredients

- ½ cup butter
- 30  large marshmallows
- 1 ½ teaspoons green food coloring
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 4 cups cornflakes cereal
- 2 tablespoons cinnamon red hot candies

## Instructions

1. Melt butter in a large saucepan over low heat. Add marshmallows, and cook stirring constantly, until melted. Remove from the heat, stir in food coloring and vanilla, then stir in cornflakes.
2. Set out one or two sheets of waxed paper. Fill a skillet with 1 inch of very hot water. Place the saucepan into the skillet so cookie dough stays warm.
3. Quickly drop a heaping tablespoonful of cookie dough onto the waxed paper, and use lightly greased fingers to form it into a wreath shape. Immediately decorate cookie with red hot candies. Repeat to shape and decorate remaining cookies.
4. Allow cookies to cool to room temperature before removing from waxed paper, about 15 minutes. Store in an airtight container.
