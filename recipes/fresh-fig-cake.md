## Ingredients

- ¼ cup butter, softened
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1  egg
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 cup fat-free evaporated milk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ¼ teaspoon almond extract
- 1 cup chopped fresh figs
- 2 cups chopped fresh figs
- ¼ cup packed brown sugar

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray two 8-inch round cake pans with vegetable oil spray.
2. In a medium bowl, sift together flour, salt and baking powder. Set aside.
3. In a large mixing bowl, cream butter with the sugar until fluffy. Add egg and beat well. Add flour mixture alternately with the evaporated milk. Fold in vanilla and almond extracts and 1 cup chopped figs.
