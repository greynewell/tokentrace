## Ingredients

- 1 ½ tablespoons brown sugar
- 1 ½ teaspoons sea salt
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon onion powder
- ½ teaspoon paprika
- ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon dry mustard
- ¼ teaspoon crushed fennel seeds
- 6  boneless pork loin chops, 1/2 inch thick
- ¼ cup pure maple syrup, preferably dark amber  (Grade B)
- 2 tablespoons spicy brown mustard
- 1 pinch garlic powder
- 1 pinch paprika
- 1 pinch freshly ground black pepper
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper  (Optional)
- ½ cup seasoned bread crumbs
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 tablespoon canola oil
- 1 clove clove garlic, crushed

## Instructions

1. Whisk brown sugar, sea salt, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, onion powder, 1/2 teaspoon paprika, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, dry mustard, and fennel seeds together in a small bowl.
2. Pat pork loin chops dry with a paper towel. Score the meat on both sides, 1/8-inch deep in cross-hatch lines spaced 1/2-inch apart, with a sharp knife; rub spice mixture onto all sides of pork chops and into scored lines. Cover chops; refrigerate for 4 to 6 hours.
3. Whisk maple syrup, brown mustard, pinch of garlic powder, pinch of paprika, pinch of black pepper, and cayenne pepper together in a small bowl; set aside.
4. Coat pork chops on all sides with seasoned bread crumbs.
5. Heat olive oil and canola oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir garlic into pan, and cook until lightly browned and fragrant, about 1 minute; remove garlic from pan and discard.
6. Place pork chops into skillet in batches to avoid crowding; cook chops until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Return all pork chops to skillet; reduce heat to medium. Drizzle half the maple syrup mixture over pork chops. Turn chops and cook until glazed, 1 to 2 minutes. Drizzle remaining maple syrup mixture over pork chops; turn and cook until glazed, 1 to 2 minutes.
7. Reduce heat to low; cover pork chops and cook until slightly pink in the center, about 5 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
