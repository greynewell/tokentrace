## Ingredients

- ⅛ teaspoon saffron threads
- 1 tablespoon boiling water
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt, or more to taste
- ½ teaspoon ground turmeric
- ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon onion powder
- ¼ teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 ½ pounds skinless cod fillets, about 1-inch thick
- ¼ cup grapeseed oil
- ¼  orange, juiced
- 1  orange, cut into wedges
- 1  lime, cut into wedges

## Instructions

1. Crush saffron threads to a powder in a small mortar and pestle. Transfer to a small bowl with 1 tablespoon boiling water. Stir, cover, and set saffron water aside.
2. Combine flour, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, turmeric, pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder on a large plate.
3. Dry fish well with paper towels. Cut into 3-inch long pieces and season with salt. Dredge fish in the flour mixture on all sides.
4. Heat oil in a large pan over medium to medium-high heat. Add fish and fry on one side until nice and golden, about 7 minutes. Flip fish, drizzle saffron water over top, and fry the other side until golden and fish flakes easily with a fork, about 5 more minutes.
5. Transfer fish to a serving platter. Squeeze orange juice over top and serve with orange and lime wedges.
