## Ingredients

- 3 large sweet potatoes
- 1 cup butter (such as Land O'Lakes®), melted
- 5  eggs, beaten
- 1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk (such as PET®)
- 1 cup white sugar, or to taste
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ½ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ½ teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon lemon juice
- 3  pie shells, thawed

## Instructions

1. Place sweet potatoes into a large pot and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, 40 to 50 minutes. Drain water, peel sweet potatoes, and mash in a bowl.
2. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
3. Mix butter and eggs together in a bowl until smooth; stir into mashed sweet potatoes. Mix milk, sugar, flour, vanilla extract, nutmeg, baking powder, and lemon juice into sweet potato mixture; pour into the 3 pie shells.
4. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Lower oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue to bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of a pie comes out clean, about 40 minutes more. Cool pies for 15 to 30 minutes before refrigerating to cool completely, 1 to 2 hours.
