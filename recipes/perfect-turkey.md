## Ingredients

- 1 (18 pound) whole turkey, neck and giblets removed
- 2 cups kosher salt
- ½ cup butter, melted
- 2 large onions, peeled and chopped
- 4  carrots, peeled and chopped
- 4 stalks celery, chopped
- 2 sprigs fresh thyme
- 1  bay leaf
- 1 cup dry white wine

## Instructions

1. Rub turkey inside and out with kosher salt; place in a large stockpot and cover with cold water. Cover and refrigerate to allow turkey to soak in brine solution for 12 hours, or overnight.
2. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Thoroughly rinse the turkey; discard the brine mixture.
3. Brush turkey with 1/2 of the melted butter. Place breast-side down on a roasting rack in a shallow roasting pan. Stuff turkey cavity with 1/2 the onion, 1/2 the carrots, 1/2 the celery, 1 sprig of thyme, and bay leaf. Scatter remaining vegetables and thyme in the bottom of the roasting pan; pour white wine over vegetables.
4. Roast turkey in the preheated oven, uncovered, until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 3 1/2 to 4 hours. Carefully turn turkey breast-side up about 2/3 through the roasting time, and brush with remaining butter. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
5. Allow turkey to rest for 30 minutes before carving.
