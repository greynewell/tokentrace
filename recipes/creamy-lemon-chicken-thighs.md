## Ingredients

- 6  chicken thighs
- 6  chicken drumsticks
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 2 teaspoons ground black pepper
- 2 teaspoons ground paprika
- 2 tablespoons salted butter
- 4 sprigs fresh thyme leaves
- 2 cloves minced garlic
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- ½ cup white wine
- ½ cup chicken stock
- lemon, juiced
- ½ cup heavy whipping cream
- ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Place chicken in a large bowl and coat generously with salt, pepper, and paprika.
3. Heat butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add chicken to the skillet in batches, skin-side down. Cook until skin is golden and crispy, about 2 minutes per batch. Remove chicken and place into a large baking dish.
4. Add thyme and garlic to the skillet. Cook over medium heat until garlic is fragrant and lightly browned, about 1 minute. Whisk in flour slowly into a thick paste. Add wine, stock, lemon juice, and cream and bring to a simmer, about 5 minutes. Add Parmesan cheese and stir until melted. Pour sauce over chicken in the baking dish.
5. Bake in the preheated oven, uncovered, until chicken is not longer pink inside and juices run clear, about 30 minutes.
