## Ingredients

- ⅔ cup all-purpose flour
- ¼ cup white sugar
- ¾ teaspoon baking powder
- 3 tablespoons cold butter
- 2 tablespoons Blue Diamond Vanilla Almond Breeze
- ½ cup white sugar
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch
- 4 large egg yolks
- 2 cups Blue Diamond Vanilla Almond Breeze
- 1 cup chopped, peeled fresh peaches
- 1 cup peach jam or preserves, divided
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon almond extract
- 1 (13.5 ounce) can coconut milk

## Instructions

1. To prepare crumble, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Stir together flour, sugar and baking powder in a medium bowl. Cut in butter with a fork until it's the size of peas, then lightly stir in 2 to 2 1/2 tablespoons Almond Breeze.
2. Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet and break into 1/2- to 1-inch pieces; bake for 15 minutes. Let cool, then coarsely crumble.
3. To prepare ice cream, whisk together sugar, cornstarch, and egg yolks in a medium saucepan, then slowly whisk in Almond Breeze. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, whisking constantly. Cook over low heat, stirring frequently, until mixture is slightly thickened; let cool.
4. Transfer to a blender with peaches, 1/2 cup peach jam, vanilla and almond extracts, and coconut milk; puree until smooth.
5. Cover and chill well. Transfer to an ice cream maker bowl and freeze according to manufacturer's instructions.
6. Place a layer of ice cream in the bottom of a 1-quart dish (such as a loaf pan). Top with small spoonfuls of the remaining jam and some of the crumble. Repeat layers several times, saving a little of the crumble for garnishing, if desired.
7. Cover and freeze until ready to serve. Top small scoops of ice cream with a sprinkle of the crumble.
