## Ingredients

- ⅔ cup oil
- 3 tablespoons milk
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons white sugar
- 1 ¼ teaspoons salt
- 2 cups frozen cranberries, sorted and rinsed
- 2 cups chopped apples
- ⅔ cup white sugar
- 3 ½ teaspoons all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Combine oil and milk in a liquid measuring cup; stir to combine.
3. Combine flour, sugar, and salt in a medium bowl; mix together with a fork. Add oil mixture and mix until well combined. Press a little more than 1/2 of the crust mixture into the bottom and sides of a pie plate, using a spatula if necessary, as mixture will crumble easily.
4. Combine cranberries and apples in a large mixing bowl. Add sugar, flour, and lemon juice; mix until fruit is evenly coated. Pour filling into the pie plate and crumble remaining crust mixture over the top.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until filling is bubbly and crumb topping is golden brown, 40 to 50 minutes.
