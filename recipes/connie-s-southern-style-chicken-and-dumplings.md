## Ingredients

- 1 whole chicken, rinsed and giblets removed
- 8 cups water
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons butter  (Optional)
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 4 teaspoons butter  (Optional)
- 1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour, or as needed
- 1 tablespoon butter  (Optional)
- ¼ cup evaporated milk

## Instructions

1. Place the chicken into a large soup pot, and pour in the water.
2. Add salt and 2 tablespoons butter, bring to a boil, and reduce heat to medium-low.
3. Simmer the chicken until the meat is very tender, 2 1/2 to 3 hours.
4. Remove the chicken from the stock, and allow the chicken and stock to cool.
5. Separate the chicken meat from the skin and bones, and chop the meat into bite-size pieces.
6. Strain chicken stock through a wire mesh strainer into a large pot; set aside.
7. Bring all but 2/3 cup of the reserved chicken stock to a boil over medium heat.
8. In a separate saucepan, bring 2/3 cup of chicken stock to a boil.
9. Stir in 1/2 teaspoon salt and 4 teaspoons of butter, and bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat.
10. Beat in the flour to form a slightly sticky dough.
11. Remove dough to a well-floured surface, and roll to desired thickness.
12. Knead in more flour if dough is too sticky.
13. Cut the dough into strips about 4 inches long; drop dumplings into the boiling chicken stock.
14. Reduce heat to low, and simmer the dumplings until tender, about 10 minutes.
15. Stir 1 more tablespoon of butter into the stock to add richness, if desired; return chopped chicken meat to the pan.
