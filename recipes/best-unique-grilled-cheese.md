## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon water
- 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- ½ teaspoon minced garlic
- 1 tablespoon butter, softened
- 2 slices bread
- 2 tablespoons cream cheese, softened
- 2 slices Cheddar cheese
- 4 slices pickles, or as desired
- 4 slices tomato

## Instructions

1. Combine water, vinegar, sugar, red pepper flakes, and garlic in a small saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir until sugar is dissolved and sauce is slightly reduced, about 5 minutes.
2. Heat a skillet over low heat.
3. Spread butter onto 1 side of each bread slice. Spread cream cheese on the opposite side of 1 of the bread slices. Layer Cheddar cheese and pickles on top of the cream cheese layer. Drizzle 1 to 2 tablespoons sauce on the other slice of bread on the side opposite the butter; place bread on top of pickle layer, butter-side on the outside, creating a sandwich.
