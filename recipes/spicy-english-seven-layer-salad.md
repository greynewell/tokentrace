## Ingredients

- 2 cups small seashell pasta
- 4  carrots, peeled and julienned
- ½ head leaf lettuce - rinsed, dried, and chopped
- 1 medium cucumber, peeled, seeded, and diced
- ¾ cup frozen green peas
- ½ cup frozen whole-kernel corn
- 2 cups mayonnaise
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon curry powder
- ½ teaspoon garlic salt
- 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

## Instructions

1. Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the pasta, and cook until tender, about 7 minutes. Drain, and rinse under cold water to cool.
2. Place the carrots in an even layer in the bottom of a large glass bowl, preferably one that is roughly the same diameter from top to bottom. Place the lettuce in a layer over the carrots. Combine the cucumber, peas and corn; spread in a layer over the lettuce. Once the pasta is cooled and drained, then spread that out over the top.
3. In a smaller bowl, stir together the mayonnaise, brown sugar, curry powder, and garlic salt. Spread this carefully over the pasta. Top with shredded Cheddar cheese. Cover, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving.
