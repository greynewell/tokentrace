## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- ½ cup confectioners' sugar
- ¾ cup unsalted butter, cut into cubes
- 4  eggs
- 1 ½ cups white sugar
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon lemon zest
- ½ cup lemon juice
- 2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
- 1 cup white sugar
- 2  eggs, beaten

## Instructions

1. Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly butter a 9x13-inch baking dish.
2. Whisk together 1 1/2 cup flour and confectioners' sugar in a mixing bowl. Cut in the cold butter with a knife or pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Press the crumbs into the bottom and up the sides of the prepared baking dish to form a crust.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 18 minutes. Remove from oven, and set aside.
4. Whisk together 4 eggs, 1 1/2 cup sugar, 1 tablespoon flour, lemon zest, and lemon juice in a bowl. Pour lemon mixture into the prepared crust. Skim off any bubbles from the surface of the filling. Mix the cream cheese and 1 cup sugar in a bowl until well blended. Whisk in 2 eggs, then spread over the lemon mixture. The mixtures will separate during baking.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until the filling is set, about 30 minutes.
