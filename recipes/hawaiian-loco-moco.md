## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 1 pound ground beef chuck
- 1 cup sliced onion
- ½ cup water
- 1 cup sliced mushrooms
- 1 (12 ounce) jar brown gravy (such as Heinz®)
- 4  eggs
- 4 cups cooked rice

## Instructions

1. Prepare a large skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium heat.
2. Divide ground chuck into 4 equal portions; form into patties.
3. Fry patties in skillet until beginning to firm and are hot and slightly pink in the center, about 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Remove patties to a plate, retaining drippings in the skillet.
4. Stir onion and water into the reserved drippings. Reduce heat to low and cook until the onions are slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Stir mushrooms into the onion mixture; cook until mushrooms are cooked through, about 5 minutes more.
5. Pour gravy over the onion and mushroom mixture; stir. Cook until the gravy is hot, about 5 minutes. Gently lie patties into the gravy; simmer until reheated through.
6. While the patties simmer in gravy, prepare a separate skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium heat. Fry eggs in the hot skillet until the white is opaque but the yolk remains runny, 2 to 3 minutes.
7. Divide rice between 4 plates. Top each rice portion with a beef patty and top the patties each with an egg. Pour gravy equally over each portion.
