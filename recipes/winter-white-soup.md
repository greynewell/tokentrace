## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 3 cloves garlic, chopped
- 2  shallots, chopped
- 1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger, minced
- 3  green onions, chopped
- ⅓ small head cauliflower, chopped
- 1 small parsnip, chopped
- 10 small button mushrooms, chopped
- 1  pear - peeled, cored and diced
- ½ cup cannellini beans
- ½ teaspoon Dijon mustard
- 1 teaspoon chopped fresh dill
- ¾ cup Chardonnay wine
- 6 sprigs fresh thyme
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can fat-free chicken broth  (Optional)
- ⅓ cup heavy cream
- salt and pepper to taste
- ¼ cup fat-free chicken broth  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Heat butter and olive oil in a large saucepan over low heat. Stir in garlic, shallots, and ginger; cook and stir until fragrant but not brown, about 5 minutes. Stir in cauliflower, mushrooms, green onions, and parsnip; cook and stir for an additional 5 minutes. Add pear, beans, dill, and mustard; stir just until heated through, about 1 minute.
2. Stir in wine and thyme; increase heat to high. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly, and simmer until wine is reduced by half and is syrupy, about 5 minutes. Pour in chicken broth; return to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer, partly covered, until vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes. Allow soup to cool slightly.
3. Fill a blender halfway with soup. Cover and hold the lid down with a potholder; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Pour into a pot. Repeat with remaining soup.
4. Stir in cream and, if needed, thin with additional chicken broth. Season with salt and pepper; serve hot.
