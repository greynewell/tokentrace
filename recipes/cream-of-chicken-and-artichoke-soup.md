## Ingredients

- 2 cups chicken broth
- 2 cups water
- ½  lemon
- 2 teaspoons vegetable oil, or as needed
- 1  red bell pepper, diced
- 1 cup diced tomatoes  (Optional)
- 1 (14 ounce) can artichoke hearts, drained and chopped
- 1  russet potato, diced
- 1 small carrot, diced
- 1  celery stalk, diced
- 2  green onions, chopped
- ¼ cup chopped mushrooms
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 cup heavy whipping cream
- ½ cup white cooking wine
- 2  fully cooked chicken breasts, cut into bite-size pieces
- 1 pinch ground black pepper

## Instructions

1. Heat chicken broth and water in a stockpot over medium-high heat. Squeeze lemon juice in and stir. Cook for 5 minutes.
2. Heat oil in a grill pan over medium-high heat. Add red bell pepper; grill until somewhat soft, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer red bell pepper to the stockpot; add tomatoes, artichokes, potato, carrot, celery, green onions, mushrooms, and garlic. Increase heat to high. Bring to a boil; cook until vegetables are soft, about 15 minutes. Stir in cream and wine.
3. Fill blender halfway with the vegetable-broth mixture. Cover and hold lid down with a potholder; pulse a few times before leaving on to puree. Pour into a separate pot. Repeat with remaining vegetable-broth mixture.
4. Pour all the pureed mixture back into the original stockpot; add chicken and black pepper. Heat over medium heat. Bring to a simmer and cook until heated through, about 5 minutes.
