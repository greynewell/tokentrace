## Ingredients

- 2 pounds thick-cut bacon, divided
- 3 tablespoons barbeque seasoning, divided, or to taste
- 2 pounds bulk Italian sausage
- 1 cup finely shredded Cheddar and Monterey Jack cheese blend
- ¼ cup diced fresh jalapeno pepper  (Optional)
- 2  green onions, thinly sliced
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 (12 ounce) bottle barbeque sauce, divided
- wood chips, soaked

## Instructions

1. Stack and weave 1 1/2 pounds bacon slices into a 12-inch square lattice. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon barbeque seasoning.
2. Place the remaining bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until crispy, about 10 minutes. Chop the cooled bacon slices into chunks.
3. Place sausage in a 1-gallon resealable plastic bag. Seal the bag most of the way; flatten and shape the sausage into a large square. Cut away the plastic bag and discard; place the sausage square on the bacon lattice.
4. Sprinkle bacon pieces over the sausage square. Sprinkle Cheddar Jack cheese, jalapenos, green onions, and garlic on top. Drizzle with 1/2 the barbeque sauce and sprinkle the remaining 2 tablespoons barbeque seasoning on top.
5. Roll the sausage square into a log. Wrap the bacon lattice over the sausage log and roll tightly.
6. Place the roll, seam side-down, onto wire racks. Place the racks into the smoker. Add wood chips according to manufacturer's directions. Smoke until no longer pink in the center, about 2 hours, basting the roll with the remaining barbeque sauce during the last 20 to 30 minutes of cooking. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (75 degrees C).
7. Remove bacon bomb from the smoker; let rest for 30 minutes before slicing.
