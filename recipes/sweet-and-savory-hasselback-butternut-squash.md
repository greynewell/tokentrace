## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon oil, or as needed
- 1 large butternut squash - peeled, halved lengthwise, and seeded
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 3 tablespoons water
- ¼ cup butter
- ¼ cup honey
- 1 tablespoon cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic
- 1 teaspoon fresh oregano leaves
- 1 teaspoon dried orange peel
- ½ teaspoon smoked paprika
- 2 sprigs fresh oregano, or as needed
- ¼ cup dried cranberries

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Rub oil over squash and season with salt. Place on a rimmed baking sheet and add water.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until softened, about 20 minutes.
