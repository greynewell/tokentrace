## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 cup butter, at room temperature
- ½ cup powdered sugar
- 3 cups blueberries
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 1 teaspoon lemon extract

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Mix flour, butter, and powdered sugar together until a dough forms. Press dough into a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Let cool slightly.
4. Meanwhile, toss blueberries with cornstarch and place in a saucepan over low heat. Add sugar and lemon extract. Simmer, stirring gently to avoid crushing the berries, until sugar dissolves and filling thickens, 5 to 8 minutes.
5. Pour blueberry filling over the cooled crust. Let cool before slicing.
