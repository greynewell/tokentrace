## Ingredients

- 4 medium beets
- 4 cups beef broth
- 1  onion, chopped
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon black pepper
- 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
- 1  cucumber - peeled, seeded, and diced
- ½ cup sour cream

## Instructions

1. Remove stems and leaves from beets, but leave on skins. Cover beets with cold water and bring to a boil in a deep pot. Boil until fork tender, about 40 minutes.
