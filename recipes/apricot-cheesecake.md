## Ingredients

- 1 ⅓ cups almond flour
- 3 tablespoons brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons sliced almonds, chopped
- 2 tablespoons butter, melted
- 8 ounces dried apricots
- water to cover
- 2 tablespoons amaretto liqueur
- 1 teaspoon white sugar, or to taste
- 3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
- ¾ cup white sugar
- ½ cup sour cream
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch
- 1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract
- 3  eggs, at room temperature
- 1 ½ cups sour cream
- 3 tablespoons white sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 9-inch springform pan with parchment paper.
2. Combine almond flour, brown sugar, and almonds in a bowl. Add melted butter; stir with a fork until the mixture resembles wet sand. Spread on the bottom of the parchment-lined pan.
3. Combine apricots and water in a saucepan; bring to a boil and simmer until very soft, about 10 minutes. Drain; mash apricots into a pulp. Add amaretto; mix well. Sweeten with 1 teaspoon white sugar.
4. Beat cream cheese, 3/4 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup sour cream, cornstarch, and 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract in a bowl using an electric mixer on low speed. Add eggs one at a time; mix well. Fold in 2 tablespoons of apricot pulp; reserve remainder for topping. Pour cheesecake batter into the pan, covering the crust.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until edges are puffed and surface of cheesecake is firm except for a small spot in the center that will jiggle when the pan is gently shaken, about 45 minutes.
6. Beat 1 1/2 cups sour cream, 3 tablespoons white sugar, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract together until combined. Remove cheesecake from the hot oven; spoon topping over the surface and return cake to the oven for 8 minutes more.
7. Cool to room temperature, about 1 hour. Refrigerate for 6 to 8 hours. Top with remaining apricot pulp.
