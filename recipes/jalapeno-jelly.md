## Ingredients

- 1 large green bell pepper
- 12  jalapeno peppers
- 1 ½ cups apple cider vinegar
- 1 pinch salt
- 4 ¼ cups granulated sugar
- 4 ounces liquid pectin
- 4  jalapeno peppers, seeded and finely chopped

## Instructions

1. Working in batches if necessary, combine green bell pepper and 12 whole jalapeño peppers in a food processor or blender. Process until finely chopped.
2. Transfer peppers to a large saucepan. Stir in cider vinegar and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes.
3. Strain mixture through at least 2 layers of cheesecloth, and discard pulp. You should have about 1 cup of liquid.
