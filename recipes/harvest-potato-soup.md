## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2  onions, chopped
- 2  carrots, diced
- 1 stalk celery, diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 cup cauliflower florets
- 1 cup diced zucchini
- 6 large potatoes, cubed
- 3 cups vegetable broth
- 1 cup chopped kale, or to taste
- ¼ cup evaporated milk
- 1  bay leaf
- ½ cup corn kernels
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1 teaspoon chopped fresh dill
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ½ cup shredded Cheddar cheese, or to taste  (Optional)
- ½ cup chopped fresh parsley, or to taste  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Melt butter in a stock pot over medium-low heat. Cook and stir onions, carrots, celery, and garlic in hot butter until the onions are translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Add cauliflower and zucchini to onion mixture; cook until just warmed, 1 to 2 minutes.
2. Stir potatoes and broth into vegetable mixture; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until potatoes are just tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Add kale to soup; cook until kale is slightly wilted, 2 to 3 minutes.
3. Pour milk into a blender and ladle about 2/3 the soup into blender, working in batches if needed. Cover and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend until smooth, 1 to 2 minutes.
4. Pour pureed soup back into stock pot; stir in corn, paprika, dill, salt, and pepper. Cook soup until corn is warmed, 2 to 3 minutes. Serve soup garnished with Cheddar cheese and parsley.
