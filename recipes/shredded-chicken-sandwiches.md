## Ingredients

- ¼ cup slivered almonds
- 2 slices white bread, torn into pieces
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 3 (5 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- 6 cups chicken broth, or as needed
- 2 tablespoons salted butter
- 4 large roll or bun (3-1/2" dia)s brioche buns, halved

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Pulse almonds in the bowl of a food processor to fine crumbs. Add bread, oil, salt, and pepper and pulse mixture to coarse crumbs. Spread evenly on a rimmed baking sheet.
3. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes, stirring halfway through. Set aside to cool.
4. Season chicken with salt and pepper, then place in a Dutch oven or deep skillet in a single layer and cover with chicken broth. Bring to a boil over medium heat, skimming foam. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until no chicken is no longer pink in the center, 10 to 14 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove chicken and let cool a bit on a cutting board, then shred with two forks.
5. Strain chicken broth to remove solids.
6. Return chicken to the pot, then add bread crumb mixture and 4 cups chicken broth. Boil over medium heat, adding more broth if necessary, until mixture reduces and reaches desired consistency, about 20 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
7. Melt butter in a skillet over medium-low heat. Toast flat sides of buns until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Fill with a generous scoop of chicken mixture and serve.
