## Ingredients

- 4 ½ teaspoons active dry yeast
- ½ cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
- 1 ¼ cups buttermilk
- 2  eggs
- 5 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- ½ cup margarine, softened
- ½ cup white sugar
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 2 tablespoons butter, softened
- ½ cup white sugar
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 1 cup chopped pecans
- ½ cup packed brown sugar
- ½ cup butter, melted

## Instructions

1. Dissolve yeast in warm water in a large mixing bowl. Add buttermilk, eggs, 2 1/2 cups flour, 1/2 cup margarine, 1/2 cup sugar, baking powder, and salt. Blend 30 seconds with mixer on low speed, scraping sides and bottom of bowl. Beat 2 minutes on medium speed. Stir in remaining 3 cups flour. (Dough should remain soft and slightly sticky). Knead for 5 minutes, or about 200 turns on a lightly floured board. Cover dough and allow to rest for half an hour.
2. Divide dough in half and roll each half into a 12x7 inch rectangle. Spread each half with 1 tablespoon soft butter; sprinkle with 1/4 cup sugar and 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon. Roll up the halves, beginning at the wide side. Seal well by pinching the seams. Cut each roll into 12 slices.
3. Coat two 9-inch round cake pans with 1/4 cup melted butter, 1/4 cup brown sugar, and 1/2 cup chopped pecans in each pan. Place 12 dough slices in each pan, leaving a small space between slices. Let rise until doubled.
4. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
5. Bake buns in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Invert pans onto serving plates immediately.
