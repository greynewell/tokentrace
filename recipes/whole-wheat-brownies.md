## Ingredients

- 4 (1 ounce) squares semisweet chocolate
- ½ cup butter
- 1 cup white sugar
- 2 each eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup whole wheat flour
- 1 cup dark chocolate chips
- ¾ cup chopped walnuts

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking pan.
2. Place chocolate and butter in the top of a double boiler over simmering water. Stir frequently, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, until chocolate is melted, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool for 5 minutes.
3. Combine sugar, eggs, vanilla extract, and salt in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Stir in the cooled melted chocolate until incorporated. Fold in flour and then stir in chocolate chips and walnuts. Pour batter into the prepared baking pan and spread evenly.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until top is dry and edges have started to pull away from the sides of the pan, 25 to 28 minutes. Let cool completely before cutting into bars.
