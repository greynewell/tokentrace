## Ingredients

- 4 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon ground paprika
- ¼ large onion, diced
- ½ teaspoon tomato paste
- 1 ½ cups halved cherry tomatoes
- ½ cup white cooking wine
- ¼ cup water
- 1 tablespoon fish sauce
- 2 (4 ounce) cans sardines, drained
- 2  limes, juiced, divided

## Instructions

1. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in an oven-safe skillet over medium heat until warm. Add garlic powder and paprika; cook until you can smell the spices, about 1 minute. Add onion and cook until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Mix in tomato paste and cook for 1 to 2 minutes longer. Add cherry tomatoes and mix until well combined. Cover the pan and cook until tomatoes begin to release their liquid, about 5 minutes.
2. While tomatoes are cooking, combine remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil with 1/2 of the lime juice. Add sardines and gently toss to coat with lime marinade.
3. Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
4. Remove the lid from the skillet. Pour cooking wine in with onion and tomatoes; stir well. Add water and fish sauce; bring to a boil. Lower heat and simmer until liquid begins to reduce, about 5 minutes.
5. Remove sardines from the marinade and place on top of tomato sauce. Discard remaining marinade.
6. Place under the preheated broiler until sardines are well cooked and some of the tomatoes are charred, 4 to 5 minutes.
7. Pour remaining lime juice over the sardines and serve.
