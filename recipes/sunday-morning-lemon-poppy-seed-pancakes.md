## Ingredients

- ¾ cup milk
- 1 tablespoon vinegar
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 1  egg
- 2 tablespoons butter, melted
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon poppy seeds
- 1 teaspoon lemon zest
- cooking spray

## Instructions

1. Stir the milk, vinegar, and lemon juice together in a bowl; let stand 10 minutes to curdle. Whisk in egg, butter, and vanilla extract.
2. In a separate bowl, mix together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, poppy seeds, and lemon zest until well combined. Pour the milk mixture into the flour mixture and whisk a few times until the batter is mostly free of lumps.
