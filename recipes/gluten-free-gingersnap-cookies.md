## Ingredients

- ¾ cup unsalted butter, softened
- ½ cup brown sugar
- ½ cup unbleached cane sugar
- 1  egg
- ¼ cup blackstrap molasses
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 cup oat flour
- ½ cup almond flour
- ⅓ cup coconut flour
- 1 (1/4 inch thick) slice fresh ginger, grated
- 1 tablespoon ground ginger
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ½ teaspoon ground cloves
- ¼ cup unbleached cane sugar, or as needed
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon, or as needed
- ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Beat butter, brown sugar, and 1/2 cup cane sugar together in a bowl using an electric mixer until creamy. Add egg and mix to combine. Mix in molasses and vanilla extract.
2. Mix oat flour, almond flour, coconut flour, fresh ginger, ground ginger, baking soda, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1 teaspoon nutmeg, and cloves together in a separate bowl. Add to butter mixture slowly and combine. Refrigerate dough for at least 1 hour, to overnight; dough will be very wet before it's chilled.
3. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper.
4. Combine 1/4 cup cane sugar, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, and 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg in a shallow dish.
5. Scoop dough by tablespoonfuls and roll into balls. Roll balls in cinnamon-sugar mixture to coat and place onto the prepared baking sheets, making sure not to overcrowd as they will flatten and spread.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until set and golden, 10 to 12 minutes. Let cookies sit for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool. Serve warm or let cool completely before storing in an airtight container.
