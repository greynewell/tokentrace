## Ingredients

- 8 ounces high-quality semisweet chocolate, broken into pieces
- 2 teaspoons canola oil, divided
- ½ teaspoon peppermint extract, divided
- 8 ounces high-quality white chocolate, broken into pieces
- 25  peppermint candies, crushed

## Instructions

1. Lightly grease a 9-inch square pan. Line the pan with waxed paper, smoothing out any wrinkles.
2. Combine semisweet chocolate and 1 teaspoon canola oil in the top of a double boiler over just barely simmering water. Stir frequently, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, until chocolate is melted. Remove from the heat and stir in 1/4 teaspoon peppermint extract.
3. Pour melted chocolate into the prepared pan, and spread evenly to cover the bottom. Sprinkle 1/2 of the crushed candy over the chocolate and refrigerate until completely hardened, about 1 hour.
4. Combine white chocolate and remaining 1 teaspoon canola oil in the top of a double boiler over just barely simmering water. Stir frequently, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, until white chocolate is melted. Remove from the heat and stir in remaining 1/4 teaspoon peppermint extract.
5. Pour melted white chocolate into the pan, directly over the hardened chocolate layer; spread evenly. Sprinkle the remaining crushed candy over top and gently press in. Refrigerate until completely hardened, about 1 hour.
6. Remove from the pan and break into small pieces to serve.
