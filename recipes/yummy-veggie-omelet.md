## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 small onion, chopped
- 1  green bell pepper, chopped
- 4  eggs
- 2 tablespoons milk
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- ⅛ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 2 ounces shredded Swiss cheese

## Instructions

1. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and bell pepper in butter until just tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer vegetables to a bowl, season with 1/4 teaspoon salt, and set aside.
2. Beat together eggs, milk, remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, and pepper in a separate bowl.
3. Melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter in the skillet over medium heat; swirl to coat the bottom of the skillet with butter. When butter is bubbly, pour in egg mixture and cook undisturbed until the bottom of eggs begin to set, about 1 minute. Gently lift the edges of omelet with a spatula to let any uncooked egg flow onto the skillet. Continue cooking until the center of omelet starts to look dry, 1 to 2 more minutes.
4. Sprinkle cheese over omelet, then spoon vegetable mixture over 1/2 of the omelet. Use a spatula to gently fold omelet over vegetables. Cook until cheese melts to desired consistency, about 1 minute. Slide omelet onto a plate. Cut in half and serve.
