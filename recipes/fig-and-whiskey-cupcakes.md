## Ingredients

- ½ cup fresh figs, finely chopped
- ½ cup whiskey
- 1 ⅔ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ¼ teaspoon cream of tartar
- ⅛ teaspoon ground cloves
- ½ cup white sugar
- ⅓ cup vegetable oil
- ¼ cup brown sugar
- 1  egg
- ½ cup buttermilk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- ¾ cup vegetable shortening (such as Crisco®)
- 5 cups powdered sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Soak figs in whiskey in a bowl for at least 30 minutes.
2. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners.
3. Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, cream of tartar, and cloves in a bowl.
4. Blend white sugar, oil, and brown sugar together in a separate bowl using an electric mixer. Add egg and mix until creamy. Mix in buttermilk and vanilla extract. Reserve 1 tablespoon of fig mixture for frosting, and mix remainder into batter. Beat in flour mixture until just combined.
5. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 2/3 full.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and transfer to wire racks to cool completely, about 30 minutes.
7. Beat cream cheese and shortening together in a bowl using an electric mixer until creamy. Add powdered sugar slowly, 1 cup at a time, until creamy. Add vanilla extract. Slowly drizzle in reserved fig mixture; mix frosting until combined.
8. Pipe frosting onto cooled cupcakes.
