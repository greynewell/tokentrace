## Ingredients

- ½ cup packed brown sugar
- ¼ cup olive oil
- ¼ cup apple cider vinegar
- 3 tablespoons mustard
- 1 tablespoon lime juice
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon seasoned salt
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 6 (5 ounce) bone-in chicken thighs

## Instructions

1. Combine brown sugar, oil, vinegar, mustard, lime juice, lemon juice, garlic, seasoned salt, and pepper in a medium bowl and mix well.
2. Place chicken in a glass or ceramic bowl and cover with sauce. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator, 8 hours or overnight.
3. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
4. Remove chicken from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade.
5. Cook chicken on the preheated grill until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 8 to 10 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
