## Ingredients

- 1 cup strong brewed coffee
- 1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
- ¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 cups white sugar
- 1 ½ teaspoons baking soda
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- ⅔ cup sour cream
- 2 large eggs
- ¼ cup mini chocolate sandwich cookies (such as Oreo® Mini)
- 1 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 1 cup shortening
- 8 cups confectioners' sugar
- 6 fluid ounces heavy cream, or more as needed
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 48  mini chocolate sandwich cookies (such as Oreo® Mini)

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line two 12-cup muffin tins with paper liners.
2. Combine coffee and butter in a large saucepan over medium heat; bring to a simmer. Add cocoa powder and whisk until smooth. Remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly.
3. Whisk flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl.
4. Combine sour cream and eggs in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment; beat until combined. Slowly add coffee mixture; mix until just combined. Add flour mixture; beat until just combined. Fill the prepared muffin cups 1/2 full with batter.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 17 minutes. Cool in the tins for 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely, about 30 minutes.
6. While the cupcakes are cooling, place 1/4 cup mini cookies in the bowl of a food processor; pulse until blended and crumbly. Set aside 2 tablespoons crumbs in a bowl for decorating the cupcakes.
7. Meanwhile, cream butter and shortening in the bowl of a stand mixer until fluffy. Gradually add confectioners' sugar, mixing until well blended. Mix in cream, vanilla extract, and salt. Add up to 2 ounces more cream if necessary, and beat at high speed until frosting is fluffy. Mix in the remaining cookie crumbs on low speed or by hand. Transfer frosting into a pastry bag fitted with a Wilton® 1M tip.
8. Make a hole in each cupcake by pressing a 1-inch cookie cutter into the center and pushing about 2/3 of the way down. Remove excess cake, fill the hole with frosting, and top with a mini cookie. Frost cupcake starting at the outside and gradually working inward to form a peak. Sprinkle with some of the reserved cookie crumbs and top with another mini cookie. Repeat to fill and frost remaining cupcakes.
