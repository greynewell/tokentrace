## Ingredients

- 3 cups frozen hash brown potatoes, thawed
- 3 tablespoons butter, melted
- 1 cup cooked ham, chopped
- 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
- ¼ cup chopped onion
- ¼ cup chopped green bell pepper
- 3  large eggs
- ½ cup milk
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Press hash brown potatoes between paper towels to remove excess moisture. Transfer potatoes to an 8-inch pie dish and press into the bottom and up the sides of the dish to form a crust. Drizzle with melted butter.
3. Bake in preheated oven until golden, about 25 minutes. Remove from oven and reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
4. Combine ham, Cheddar cheese, onion, and bell pepper in a bowl; spread mixture over potato crust. Beat eggs, milk, salt, and black pepper in the same bowl; pour over ham mixture.
5. Bake in oven until eggs are set, 25 to 30 minutes.
