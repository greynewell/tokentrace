## Ingredients

- 1 cup milk
- 1  egg
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- 3 tablespoons white sugar
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 3 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
- ¾ teaspoon active dry yeast
- 1 quart vegetable oil for frying
- ¼ cup cinnamon sugar, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Place the milk, egg, salt, sugar, butter, flour, and yeast into a bread machine in that order. Start the machine's Dough cycle.
2. Once the dough cycle has completed, remove the dough from the bread machine to a lightly floured surface. Cover with a large mixing bowl, and let rest 10 to 15 minutes. Divide the dough into 10 balls, then flatten, and gently stretch into 8x6-inch ovals (a beaver tail shape.)
3. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
4. Cook the dough one or two at a time in the hot oil until lightly browned on each side, about 2 minutes per side. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate, and sprinkle with cinnamon sugar to serve.
