## Ingredients

- 5 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- 2 cups pearl (Israeli) couscous
- 2 ½ cups water
- ½ cup French lentils
- water to cover
- 2  Roma (plum) tomatoes, diced
- 1 small cucumber, seeded and diced
- 1  red bell pepper, diced
- ½ cup dried cranberries
- ½ cup golden raisins
- ⅓ cup diced red onion
- ¼ cup 1/2-inch slices of fresh chives  (Optional)
- 2 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley, or more to taste
- 1  green onion, thinly sliced
- 1 teaspoon ground sumac  (Optional)
- ¼ cup olive oil
- 2  lemons, juiced

## Instructions

1. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir couscous in the hot oil until toasted and fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes. Add 2 1/2 cups water to couscous and bring to a boil; cover skillet and cook until couscous is tender, about 10 minutes. Rinse couscous in a colander with cold water and transfer to a bowl. Mix 1/4 cup olive oil into couscous and stir to coat.
2. Place lentils in a small pan and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until lentils are tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain and rinse lentils under cold water in a colander; add to couscous.
3. Mix tomatoes, cucumber, red bell pepper, cranberries, raisins, red onion, chives, parsley, green onion, and sumac into couscous-lentil mixture.
4. Beat 1/4 cup olive oil, lemon juice, honey, salt, and pepper together in a bowl; pour over couscous-lentil mixture and stir until coated. Refrigerate salad for flavors to blend, 8 hours to overnight.
