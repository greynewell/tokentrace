## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- ¼ cup powdered buttermilk
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon ground cloves
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ¾ cup white sugar
- ¾ cup packed brown sugar
- ½ cup vegetable oil
- 1  egg
- 1 cup water
- 2 cups diced rhubarb, or more to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line two 9x5-inch loaf pans with parchment paper.
2. Mix together 1 tablespoon cinnamon and 1 tablespoon white sugar in a small bowl; set aside.
3. Mix together flour, powdered buttermilk, 2 teaspoons cinnamon, cloves, baking soda, salt, baking powder, and nutmeg in a large bowl.
4. Combine 3/4 cup white sugar, brown sugar, vegetable oil, and egg in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until creamy. Add flour mixture in 3 to 4 batches, alternating with the water, beating batter briefly after each addition. With the last addition of flour, add rhubarb; stir only until flour is mixed in.
5. Divide batter evenly between prepared loaf pans. Sprinkle liberally with reserved cinnamon-sugar mixture.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool on racks.
