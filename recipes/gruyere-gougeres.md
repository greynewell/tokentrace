## Ingredients

- 1 cup water
- ½ cup unsalted butter
- ½ teaspoon white sugar
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- ¾ cup grated Gruyere cheese
- ⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper  (Optional)
- ⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons grated Gruyere cheese
- 3  eggs, or more as needed

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Combine water, butter, and sugar in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Remove from heat and immediately add flour. Stir quickly with a wooden spoon for 30 seconds to 1 minute.
3. Return pan to heat and stir to let excess moisture evaporate, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Scoop dough into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Let cool slightly.
4. Add 3/4 cup Gruyere cheese, cayenne, and black pepper to the dough. Beat in eggs, 1 at a time, scraping down the bowl after each addition. If mixture still clings to the beaters, add a fourth egg.
5. Pipe or spoon tablespoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto a the prepared baking sheet. Add a small pinch of remaining Gruyere cheese on top of each puff.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Lower temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C), and bake until puffed and golden brown, about 15 minutes more.
