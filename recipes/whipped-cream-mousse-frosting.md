## Ingredients

- 1 cup heavy whipping cream
- 1 (3.5 ounce) package instant vanilla pudding mix
- ¼ cup milk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 3 cups frozen whipped topping (such as Cool Whip®), thawed

## Instructions

1. Beat whipping cream, instant pudding mix, milk, and vanilla extract together with an electric hand mixer in a large bowl until soft peaks start to form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the mixture will form soft mounds rather than a sharp peak.
2. Fold whipped topping into whipping cream mixture to evenly mix. Refrigerate until ready to use.
