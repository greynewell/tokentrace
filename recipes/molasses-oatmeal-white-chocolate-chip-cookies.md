## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 cup McCann's® Quick Cooking Rolled Irish Oats
- 2 teaspoons Spice Islands® Ground Ginger
- 1 teaspoon Spice Islands ® Ground Saigon Cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon Clabber Girl® Baking Soda
- ¼ teaspoon Spice Islands® Ground Nutmeg
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¾ cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
- ¾ cup brown sugar, firmly packed
- ½ cup Grandma's® Molasses
- 1  egg
- 1 teaspoon Spice Islands® Pure Vanilla Extract
- 1 cup white chocolate chips
- ¼ cup granulated sugar

## Instructions

1. Mix flour, oats, ginger, cinnamon, baking soda, nutmeg, and salt in large bowl.
2. Using a stand mixer with the paddle attachment (or a large bowl with electric mixer), cream together the butter and brown sugar in large bowl with electric mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.
3. Add molasses, egg, and vanilla and beat on medium speed until fully incorporated. Using a spatula, scrape down the sides to release some of the dough.
4. Gradually add flour mixture, one cup at a time, on low speed until well mixed.
5. Fold in the white chocolate chips and evenly distribute as best you can.
6. Press dough into a thick flat disk. Wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate 4 hours or overnight.
7. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Shape dough into 1-inch balls. Roll in granulated sugar. Place 2 inches apart on baking sheets lined with parchment paper.
8. Bake 8 to 10 minutes or until edges of cookies just begin to brown. Remove to wire racks; cool completely.
