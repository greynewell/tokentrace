## Ingredients

- ¾ cup olive oil
- ½ cup minced chives
- ¼ cup diced preserved lemon
- ¼ cup Champagne vinegar
- 10 pounds sockeye salmon fillets
- 1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ½ (750 milliliter) bottle white wine
- ¾ cup sliced shallots
- 1 pound butter
- ½ cup minced chives
- ¼ cup diced preserved lemon
- 1 cup chopped parsley, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper.
2. Whisk olive oil, 1/2 cup chives, 1/4 cup preserved lemon, and Champagne vinegar together in a bowl.
3. Lay salmon fillets on the prepared baking sheets. Pour vinaigrette over the top. Season with salt and pepper.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until flesh flakes easily with a fork, 8 to 14 minutes depending on the thickness of the fillets.
5. Bring white wine and shallots to a simmer in a large saucepan. Cook until volume is reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low. Add butter, whisking constantly until melted. Move saucepan on and off the heat so sauce is just hot enough to melt butter, but never simmering.
6. Stir 1/2 cup chives and 1/4 cup preserved lemon into the beurre blanc. Season with salt and pepper.
7. Transfer salmon fillets to a large platter. Pour beurre blanc on top. Garnish with parsley.
