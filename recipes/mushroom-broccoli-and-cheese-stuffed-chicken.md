## Ingredients

- 2 cups finely chopped broccoli florets
- 2 tablespoons water
- ½ cup shredded pepperjack cheese
- ¼ cup mayonnaise
- 4 small button mushrooms, sliced
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 4 large chicken breasts
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
2. Combine broccoli and water in a microwave-safe bowl. Cook in the microwave on high power for 2 minutes. Drain.
3. Combine cooked broccoli, pepperjack cheese, mayonnaise, mushrooms, and garlic powder in a large bowl.
4. Season both sides of each chicken breast with paprika, salt, and pepper. Use a sharp knife to cut a slice through the middle of each breast to create a deep pocket, making sure not to cut all the way through. Evenly stuff each breast with broccoli mixture and place on the prepared baking sheet.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 35 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
