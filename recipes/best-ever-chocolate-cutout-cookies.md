## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- ¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 ¼ teaspoons baking powder
- ⅛ teaspoon salt
- ¾ cup butter, softened
- 1 ¼ cups white sugar
- 1  egg

## Instructions

1. Sift together the flour, cocoa, baking powder and salt; set aside.
2. In a medium bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until smooth. Beat in the egg. Gradually stir in the sifted ingredients to form a soft dough. Divide dough into 2 pieces, flatten and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 2 hours.
3. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
4. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/8 inch in thickness. Cut into desired shapes with cookie cutters. Dough will be sticky so be sure to add more flour to the rolling surface as needed. Place cookies 1 1/2 inches apart onto cookie sheets.
5. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
