## Ingredients

- 2 cups shortening
- 2 cups white sugar
- 2 cups brown sugar
- 2 cups peanut butter
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 4  eggs
- 5 cups all-purpose flour
- 4 teaspoons baking soda

## Instructions

1. Set out four 12x14-inch long pieces of waxed paper or plastic wrap.
2. Cream shortening, white sugar, brown sugar, and peanut butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer. Beat in vanilla extract and eggs until light and fluffy.
3. Mix together flour and baking soda in a separate bowl until well combined. Gradually add flour mixture into the egg mixture, stirring until blended.
4. Divide dough into 4 pieces and form each piece into an 8 to 10-inch roll. Wrap rolls in prepared waxed paper or plastic wrap and place in the freezer until ready to bake.
5. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.
6. Remove dough from freezer and cut into 1-inch thick slices. Cut each slice into quarters and roll each piece into a ball. Place on the prepared baking sheet and use a fork to flatten with a nice crisscross design.
7. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly brown around the edges, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool on racks.
