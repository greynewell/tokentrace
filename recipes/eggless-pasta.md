## Ingredients

- 2 cups semolina flour
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ cup warm water

## Instructions

1. In a large bowl, mix flour and salt. Add warm water and stir to make a stiff dough. Increase water if dough seems too dry.
2. Pat the dough into a ball and turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead for 10 to 15 minutes. Cover. Let dough rest for 20 minutes.
3. Roll out dough using rolling pin or pasta machine. Work with a 1/4 of the dough at one time. Keep the rest covered, to prevent from drying out. Roll by hand to 1/16 of an inch thick. By machine, stop at the third to last setting.
4. Cut pasta into desired shapes.
5. Cook fresh noodles in boiling salted water for 3 to 5 minutes. Drain.
