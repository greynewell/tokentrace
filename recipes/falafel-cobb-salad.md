## Ingredients

- 1 ¼ cups water
- 1 (6 ounce) package dry falafel mix
- 2 cups vegetable oil for frying
- salt to taste
- ½ cup sour cream
- ¼ cup milk
- ¼ cup diced cucumber
- 1 teaspoon minced fresh parsley
- ⅛ teaspoon salt
- 1 (10 ounce) bag mixed salad greens
- 2  tomatoes, diced
- 1  avocado, diced
- 8 slices cooked bacon, crumbled
- 3  hard-boiled eggs, diced

## Instructions

1. Mix water and falafel mix together in a bowl; let stand for 10 minutes. Form mixture into 12 patties, about 1/2-inch thick.
2. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
3. Fry falafel patties, working in batches, in the hot oil until golden brown and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer cooked falafel to a paper towel-lined plate using a slotted spoon; season with salt. Cool falafel to room temperature; break into pieces.
4. Whisk sour cream, milk, cucumber, parsley, and 1/8 teaspoon salt together in a bowl until dressing is smooth and creamy; refrigerate.
5. Spread greens onto serving plates. Arrange tomatoes, avocado, bacon, eggs, feta cheese, and falafel in rows over the greens. Drizzle dressing over each salad.
