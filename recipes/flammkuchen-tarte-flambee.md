## Ingredients

- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
- 1 cup lukewarm water
- 1 pinch white sugar
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 6 ounces bacon strips, diced
- 3  onions, cut in half and thinly sliced
- ¾ cup heavy cream
- 2 tablespoons heavy cream
- ¾ cup sour cream
- ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon finely chopped parsley

## Instructions

1. Place 3 cups plus 3 tablespoons of flour in a large bowl and make a well in the center. Add yeast, 3 to 4 tablespoons of the lukewarm water, and sugar into the well and stir in a small amount of flour from the sides. Set aside until mixture is frothy, about 10 minutes.
2. Pour in remaining water and olive oil. Mix with a wooden spoon until everything is well combined. Add 1 teaspoon salt and knead vigorously with your hands until dough holds together as a ball.
3. Loosely cover dough with a clean dish towel and let rise in a warm, dry place until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes.
4. Prepare the topping while dough rises. Stir 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons of heavy cream and sour cream in a bowl until smooth; season with salt, pepper, and parsley.
5. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
6. Divide dough into 4 equal pieces. Roll out 2 pieces as thinly as possible into long rectangles on a large piece of parchment, so both will fit on one baking sheet. Fold the sides of the dough pieces to form a 1/4-inch edge all around. Spread cream topping evenly across the dough and top each dough piece with 1/4 of the bacon and the onion rings. Transfer the 2 flammkuchen with the parchment paper onto a baking sheet.
7. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and crisp, about 20 minutes. Repeat with the other 2 dough pieces.
