## Ingredients

- 10 cups water, or more as needed
- ½ pound baby carrots
- ½ pound celery stalks, cut in thirds
- 1 large overripe tomato, punctured with a knife
- 1 large onion, peeled and quartered
- 1  meaty ham bone
- 3 cloves garlic, diced
- 2  bay leaves
- 1 tablespoon butter
- ½ pound baby carrots, thinly sliced
- 1  red onion, chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, diced
- 1 cup dry white wine
- 1 pound split peas, picked over
- 2  russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes
- 2 (1.41 ounce) packages sazon seasoning (such as Goya®)
- 2 teaspoons ground pepper, or more to taste
- sea salt to taste

## Instructions

1. Make stock: Combine water, baby carrots, celery, tomato, quartered onion, ham bone, garlic, and bay leaves in a large stockpot. Bring stock to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer for 3 hours.
2. Remove 1 1/2 to 2 cups ham meat from bone; dice and set aside for use in soup.
3. Pour stock through a strainer and discard solids. Transfer stock to a covered container and refrigerate until fat rises to the top and solidifies, 1 to 3 hours.
4. Skim off fat and pour stock into a slow cooker.
5. Make soup: Melt butter in a saucepan and add sliced baby carrots, red onion, and diced garlic. Cook and stir until browned, 7 to 8 minutes. Pour wine into the pan and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Add to the slow cooker.
6. Rinse and drain split peas and add to the slow cooker. Add reserved ham meat, potatoes, sazon seasoning, black pepper, and salt; stir well.
7. Cook on High until soup is thickened, 5 to 6 hours.
8. Transfer about 1/3 of the soup to a blender. Cover and hold the lid down with a potholder; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Return purée to the slow cooker and stir.
