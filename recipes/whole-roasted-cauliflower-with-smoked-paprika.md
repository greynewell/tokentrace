## Ingredients

- 1 small head cauliflower
- 1 ½ teaspoons fennel seeds
- 1 ½ teaspoons smoked paprika
- 1 ¼ teaspoons sea salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- ½  lemon, juiced

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Trim large leaves off cauliflower. Trim stalk so cauliflower can sit flat in a Dutch oven.
3. Grind fennel seeds with a mortar and pestle. Mix in smoked paprika, salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Whisk in olive oil to form a paste. Rub the paste all over the cauliflower. Drizzle lemon juice all over.
4. Bake in the preheated oven, covered, until tender, about 30 minutes. Uncover and baste with any juices that have pooled at the base. Continue baking, uncovered, until top is browned and center feels completely tender when pierced with a paring knife, about 15 minutes.
