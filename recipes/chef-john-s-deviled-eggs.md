## Ingredients

- 12 large eggs
- 3 tablespoons white sugar
- 3 tablespoons water
- 1  red jalapeno pepper, sliced into thin rings
- 2 tablespoons cream cheese
- ⅓ cup mayonnaise
- ½ teaspoon Sriracha or to taste
- 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
- 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ¼ cup chopped chives

## Instructions

1. Place eggs in a large pot and cover with water. Bring to a simmer over high heat. Remove from heat, cover the pot, and let sit for 17 minutes.
2. Combine sugar and water in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Pour the warm sugar syrup over the pepper rings in a small bowl. Stir and set aside.
3. Drain eggs and fill the pan with very cold water. Let eggs sit in cold water until they are cool enough to handle, about 15 minutes.
4. Peel eggs and slice in half lengthwise. Remove yolks to a bowl and cover the egg white halves with a damp towel while you prepare the filling.
5. Mash together egg yolks, cream cheese, mayonnaise, Sriracha sauce, and Dijon mustard with a spoon or spatula until just combined. Stir in rice vinegar until smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
6. Pipe filling into the egg white halves.
7. Top each egg with a ring of candied pepper and chopped chives. Chill for at least 20 minutes before serving.
