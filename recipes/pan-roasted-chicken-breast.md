## Ingredients

- ¼ cup unsalted butter
- 2  bone-in skin-on chicken breasts
- 4  potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes
- 4  carrots, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch rounds
- 3 stalks celery, cut into 1/2-inch slices
- 1 tablespoon fresh rosemary
- 1 teaspoon fresh lemon thyme leaves
- ½ teaspoon smoked paprika
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon seasoned salt (such as LAWRY'S®)
- ¼ teaspoon ground white pepper
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Place chicken in the melted butter, skin-side down; cook chicken skin in hot butter until beginning to brown and crisped, about 5 minutes.
2. Flip chicken breasts. Arrange potatoes, carrots, and celery around the chicken.
3. Chop rosemary and lemon thyme together; sprinkle over the chicken and vegetables. Season everything with paprika, garlic powder, seasoned salt, white pepper, salt and black pepper.
4. Place a lid on the skillet and cook until chicken is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 45 to 50 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
