## Ingredients

- 4 ounces ketchup, or more to taste
- 5 teaspoons salt
- 1 tablespoon prepared mustard
- 1 tablespoon creamed horseradish
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 5 pounds 85% lean ground beef
- 1 cup warm water
- 1 cup minced onion
- 1 teaspoon monosodium glutamate (such as Ac'cent®)

## Instructions

1. Combine ketchup, salt, mustard, horseradish, Worcestershire sauce, and ground black pepper in a 1-cup measuring cup. Add more ketchup if combined ingredients don't equal 1 cup. Stir until well mixed. Place ground beef in a stock pot; pour ketchup mixture over the ground beef.
