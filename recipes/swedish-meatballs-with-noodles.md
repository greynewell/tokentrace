## Ingredients

- ½ pound ground beef
- ½ pound ground pork
- 1 ½ cups Italian-seasoned bread crumbs
- ¾ cup milk, divided
- 1 large egg, slightly beaten
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ⅛ teaspoon ground allspice
- 2 tablespoons salted butter
- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ cups low-sodium beef broth
- 1 dash Worcestershire sauce, or to taste
- 1 (16 ounce) package egg noodles
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C).
2. Combine ground beef and pork, bread crumbs, 1/2 cup milk, egg, garlic, salt, pepper, and allspice in a large bowl; mix until just combined. Use a rounded 1-tablespoon measure to form mixture into meatballs. Place meatballs on a baking sheet.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes, rotating sheet halfway through. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (72 degrees C).
4. While meatballs are baking, melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add flour; cook, whisking constantly, for about 1 minute, being careful not to burn or brown flour. Gradually whisk in broth and remaining 1/4 cup milk; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until sauce has thickened slightly, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in Worcestershire sauce and remove sauce from heat.
5. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rapid boil. Cook egg noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, 7 to 9 minutes.
6. While noodles are cooking, drain any grease from meatballs. Add meatballs to sauce; toss gently to coat. Place over low heat to keep warm. Add milk or water to thin sauce if too thick.
7. Drain egg noodles and serve hot topped with sauce, meatballs, and parsley.
