## Ingredients

- ½ cup slivered almonds
- 2 cups chicken broth
- ½ cup uncooked brown rice
- ½ cup uncooked wild rice
- 3 tablespoons butter
- 3  onions, sliced into 1/2 inch wedges
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- 1 cup dried cranberries
- ⅔ cup fresh sliced mushrooms
- ½ teaspoon orange zest
- salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Place almonds on an ungreased baking sheet. Toast at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 5 to 8 minutes.
2. Mix broth, brown rice, and wild rice in a medium saucepan, and bring to boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 45 minutes, until rice is tender and broth is absorbed.
