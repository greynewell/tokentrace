## Ingredients

- 2 cups vanilla wafer crumbs
- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 14 ounces individually wrapped caramels, unwrapped
- 1 (5 ounce) can evaporated milk
- 1 cup chopped pecans
- 3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese
- ½ cup white sugar
- 1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract
- 2  eggs
- ½ cup semisweet chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter one 9 inch springform pan.
2. Toast the pecans at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 6 minutes. Remove pecans and set aside. Leave oven at 350 degrees C (175 degrees C). In a small saucepan, melt the unsalted butter.
3. Combine vanilla wafer crumbs with the melted butter then press into the bottom of the prepared springform pan. Place the pan onto a cookie sheet and bake for 10 minutes at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Remove and allow to cool.
4. In a double boiler, or a bowl set over barely simmering water, melt the caramels in the evaporated milk. Stir until smooth. Pour this over the cooled crust. Sprinkle the nuts over the top.
5. In a bowl, combine the cheese, sugar, and vanilla and beat until smooth, scraping down the bowl several times. Add the eggs, one at a time and beat until smooth. Melt the chocolate chips in the double boiler and mix into the cheese mixture. Pour the batter over the caramel layer.
