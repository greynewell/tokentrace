## Ingredients

- 1 (7.5 ounce) package dry cornbread mix
- 1 cup butter
- 2  onions, chopped
- 1  green bell pepper, chopped
- 6 stalks celery, chopped
- 1 pound pork sausage
- 16 slices white bread
- 2 teaspoons dried sage
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 teaspoon poultry seasoning
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ cup chopped fresh parsley
- 2  eggs
- 4 cups chicken stock

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking pan.
2. Make the cornbread: Combine cornbread mix, milk, and egg in a small bowl; stir until well blended. Pour batter into the prepared baking pan.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 19 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool. Lower the oven temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
4. While the cornbread is cooking, make the dressing: Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook onions, celery, and bell pepper in the melted butter until tender but not brown. Remove from the heat; do not drain.
5. At the same time, cook sausage in another large skillet over medium-high heat until evenly browned. Remove from the heat.
6. Crumble cooled cornbread into a food processor. Add bread pieces and pulse until crumbly. Transfer mixture to a large bowl.
7. Add sage, thyme, poultry seasoning, salt, and pepper to the cornbread mixture. Mix in parsley, cooked vegetables, and sausage with pan drippings. Stir in chicken stock and eggs; it will be a bit mushy.
8. Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan and fill with cornbread dressing.
9. Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour.
