## Ingredients

- 1 (18.25 ounce) package white cake mix
- 3  eggs
- ⅓ cup vegetable oil
- 1 cup water
- ½ teaspoon coconut extract
- 1 (14 ounce) can sweetened cream of coconut
- 1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
- 1 cup heavy whipping cream
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 1 cup flaked coconut

## Instructions
