## Ingredients

- 18  cream-filled chocolate sandwich cookies (such as Oreo®), crushed
- 1 ½ tablespoons butter
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- 1 cup confectioners' sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 cup creamy peanut butter
- 3 cups frozen whipped topping, thawed
- ¾ cup frozen whipped topping, thawed
- 2 tablespoons chocolate sundae syrup (such as Smucker's®)
- 2 tablespoons caramel sundae syrup (such as Smucker's®)
- 4  peanut butter cups (such as Reese's®), chopped

## Instructions

1. Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix the chocolate cookies with the butter and cinnamon in a bowl. Press mixture firmly into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan.
2. Bake in the preheated oven until the crust hardens, about 8 minutes. Set aside to cool.
