## Ingredients

- 2 cups flour
- 1 tablespoon dried tarragon
- 2 tablespoons salt
- 1 tablespoon ground ginger
- 2 tablespoons ground black pepper
- 1 tablespoon dry mustard powder
- 1 tablespoon dried thyme leaves
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1  egg
- ¼ cup milk
- 8 (6 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- ½ cup vegetable oil

## Instructions

1. Stir together flour, salt, pepper, tarragon, ginger, mustard powder, thyme, garlic powder, and oregano in a shallow bowl until well-blended. Beat together egg and milk in a separate bowl until smooth.
2. Dredge chicken breasts in flour mixture, shake off excess, then dip in egg, and again in flour. Set aside to rest for 10 minutes.
3. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
4. Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Dredge chicken breasts in flour once more; shake off excess.
5. Cook chicken breasts in hot oil until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Place onto a baking sheet.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 to 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
