## Ingredients

- 2 whole chickens rotisserie chickens, with juices
- 1 gallon water to cover
- 1 ½ large onions, diced
- ½ stick butter
- 5 cloves garlic, diced
- 10 each carrots, peeled and sliced
- 5 stalks celery, diced
- 3 (15.25 ounce) cans whole kernel corn, drained
- ¼ cup dried parsley
- 2 tablespoons dried oregano
- 1 pinch freshly ground black pepper to taste
- ½ pound flat whole wheat noodles
- ½ cup cold water
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch

## Instructions

1. Place rotisserie chickens, with juices, in a very large stockpot. Cover with water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes. Remove chickens and let cool until safe to handle. Remove meat from bones and cut into small pieces.
2. Strain stock, if needed, into another container; set aside.
3. Combine onions and butter in the stockpot over medium heat. Cook and stir onions until translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add garlic and cook for 5 minutes. Stir in carrots and celery. Cook, stirring occasionally, until nearly tender, about 15 minutes. Stir in corn, parsley, and pepper.
4. Pour chicken stock back into the pot and bring to a boil. Cook until carrots are tender, 6 to 7 minutes. Add noodles and cook until starting to soften yet still firm to the bite, 5 to 6 minutes.
5. Mix water and cornstarch together in the meantime. Reduce heat to medium. Stir cornstarch slurry into the soup, a little at time, to reach desired thickness. Add chicken to the soup and heat through, about 5 minutes.
