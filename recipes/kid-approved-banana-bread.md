## Ingredients

- ¾ cup packed brown sugar
- ¼ cup butter, softened
- 1  egg
- 3 medium very ripe bananas
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- ½ cup whole wheat flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 ¼ teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ cup chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a loaf pan.
2. Beat brown sugar and butter together using an electric mixer in a mixing bowl until creamy. Add egg and beat on medium-high speed until mixture is light and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes. Mash bananas using a fork and add to mixture, beating just until mixture is fairly smooth (some lumps are okay).
3. Combine all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a separate bowl. Blend into banana mixture until just combined. Fold in chocolate chips. Pour into the prepared loaf pan.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven and let cool 5 minutes; turn pan over to release loaf and let cool further on a wire rack. Tastes best warm.
