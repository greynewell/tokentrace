## Ingredients

- ½ cup Worcestershire sauce
- 2 tablespoons yellow mustard
- 1 pound top sirloin steak, cut into thin strips
- 1 cup uncooked long-grain white rice
- 2 cups water
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- ½ cup chopped sweet onion
- 2 cloves garlic, peeled and chopped
- 1 teaspoon pepper

## Instructions

1. Mix together Worcestershire sauce and mustard in a medium container. Stir in steak strips until well coated. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, place water and rice in a medium saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and cook until rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, about 20 minutes.
3. Heat olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir onion, garlic, and pepper in hot oil until onion is tender. Remove steak from marinade and add to the saucepan. Cook, stirring occasionally, until steak reaches desired doneness, about 10 minutes. Discard remaining marinade. Serve over cooked rice.
