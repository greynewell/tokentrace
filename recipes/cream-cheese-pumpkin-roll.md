## Ingredients

- 3  eggs
- 1 cup white sugar
- ⅔ cup pumpkin puree
- ¾ cup all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon ground ginger
- ½ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- 1 cup confectioners' sugar
- ¼ cup butter, softened
- 1 tablespoon pumpkin puree
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 10x15-inch jelly roll pan and line with waxed paper.
2. Make the cake: Combine flour, cinnamon, baking powder, ginger, nutmeg, and salt in a medium bowl.
3. Beat sugar and eggs in a large bowl with an electric mixer until well blended. Stir in pumpkin puree. Add flour mixture and stir until just blended. Pour batter into the prepared jelly roll pan.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool in the pan for 10 minutes.
5. Turn cake out onto a clean kitchen towel. Remove and discard waxed paper. Starting with the short end of the cake, roll both the cake and towel up into a log; let cool completely, about 30 minutes.
6. While the cake is cooling, make the filling: Beat cream cheese, confectioners' sugar, butter, pumpkin puree, and vanilla in a mixing bowl until smooth.
7. Spread a large sheet of plastic wrap on a work surface. Carefully unroll the cooled cake onto the plastic wrap.
8. Spread filling over the cake, re-roll the cake (without the towel), and wrap carefully with plastic wrap. Transfer cake, seam-side down, to a plate. Refrigerate until fully chilled, about 2 hours.
