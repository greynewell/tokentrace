## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1  onion, finely chopped
- 2 cups Arborio rice
- ½ cup white wine
- 1 quart reduced-sodium chicken broth, warmed
- ¼ cup chile-garlic flavored butter
- 12 ounces medium shrimp, peeled and deveined, tails left on
- 1  carrot, cut into thin strips
- ⅓ cup pine nuts
- ¼ cup sliced black olives
- 1 large red chile pepper, minced
- ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat.
2. Stir in the onion and cook until softened and translucent, about 3 minutes.
3. Stir in Arborio rice until well coated in oil; continue cooking until both the onion and rice begin to turn golden-brown, about 8 minutes.
4. Pour in the white wine and stir until evaporated.
5. Pour in 1/3 of the hot chicken broth; stir constantly as the risotto simmers and slowly absorbs the broth, about 8 minutes.
6. Add half of the remaining broth, and continue stirring until absorbed, about another 8 minutes.
7. Stir in chile-garlic butter, shrimp, carrot, pine nuts, black olives, and red chile pepper until the butter has melted.
8. Stir in the remaining chicken broth, and again stir constantly until absorbed, about 8 minutes.
9. Season to taste with black pepper.
10. At this point, taste the rice; it should be slightly firm and totally delicious.
11. If it is still a little crunchy, stir in some hot water and continue cooking until it reaches the desired tenderness.
