## Ingredients

- 1 cup unsalted butter or unsalted margarine*
- 8 ounces semisweet chocolate chips, or bars, cut into bite-size chunks
- 5  large eggs
- ½ cup sugar
- Pinch of salt
- 4 teaspoons flour (or matzo meal, ground in a blender to a fine powder)
- 8  extra-large paper muffin cups (or use regular paper muffin cups, which will make 12 cakes)
- 1 (6 ounce) container raspberries, barely moistened and rolled in about
- ½ cup sugar right before serving

## Instructions

1. Melt butter and chocolate in a medium heat-proof bowl over a saucepan of simmering water; remove from heat. Beat eggs, sugar, and salt with a hand mixer in a medium bowl until sugar dissolves. Beat egg mixture into chocolate until smooth. Beat in flour until just combined. (Batter can be made a day ahead; return to room temperature an hour or so before baking.)
2. Adjust the oven rack to the middle position; preheat the oven to 450 degrees (230 degrees C).
3. Line a standard-size muffin tin (1/2 cup capacity) with 8 extra-large muffin papers (papers should extend above cups to facilitate removal). Spray muffin papers with cooking spray. Divide batter among muffin cups.
4. Bake until batter puffs but the center is not set, 8 to 10 minutes. Carefully lift cakes from the tin and set on a work surface. Pull papers away from cakes and transfer cakes to dessert plates.
5. Make garnish: Roll slightly dampened raspberries in sugar.
6. Top each cake with sugared raspberries and serve immediately.
