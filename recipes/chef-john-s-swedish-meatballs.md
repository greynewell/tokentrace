## Ingredients

- Meatballs:
- 2 tablespoons butter
- ½  yellow onion, finely chopped
- 1 ½ teaspoons fine salt
- ¼ cup milk
- 2  large eggs
- ⅓ cup plain bread crumbs
- ¾ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ¼ teaspoon ground allspice
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
- 1 pound ground beef chuck
- 1 pound ground pork
- Gravy:
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 3 ¼ cups beef broth
- ½ cup heavy cream
- ½ teaspoon white sugar
- ¼ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- cooking spray

## Instructions

1. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and salt in butter until onion begins to turn translucent, about 6 minutes.
2. Transfer onion mixture to a large bowl. Stir in milk, eggs, bread crumbs, black pepper, nutmeg, allspice, and cayenne.
3. Mix beef and pork into the bread crumb mixture. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour.
4. Melt butter for gravy in a large skillet over medium heat; whisk in flour and cook until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Slowly whisk in beef broth.
5. Increase heat to medium-high, whisk cream into mixture and bring to a simmer. Stir in sugar and Worcestershire. Simmer until slightly thickened, 6 to 7 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper. Remove from heat and set aside.
6. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and lightly coat with cooking spray.
7. Roll 2 to 3 tablespoons meatball mixture into a ball using wet hands; repeat with remaining meatball mixture. Place meatballs on the prepared baking sheet.
8. Bake in the preheated oven until browned, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
9. Transfer meatballs to the gravy and cook over medium-low heat until warmed through, about 5 minutes.
