## Ingredients

- 2 ½ cups sourdough starter
- 1 ½ cups water
- 1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
- 3 tablespoons butter, melted
- 3 tablespoons white sugar
- 6 cups bread flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons cornmeal, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Bring sourdough starter to room temperature.
2. Heat water to 120 degrees F (49 degrees C) to 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) in a saucepan. Transfer to a glass bowl; add yeast. Cover with plastic wrap; let stand about 10 minutes.
3. Stir melted butter and sugar together in a bowl. Add butter mixture to yeast water; stir in starter.
4. Combine 3 cups flour and salt in a large bowl. Add starter mixture slowly; mix well. Stir in 2 cups flour; turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface.
5. Knead in as much remaining flour as possible to create a stiff, smooth ball, at least 10 minutes. Transfer ball to a lightly oiled bowl; cover with plastic wrap. Let rise until doubled, 45 minutes to 2 hours.
6. Punch dough down; turn out onto a floured surface. Divide into 14 balls; cover and let rise for 30 minutes.
7. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Sprinkle cornmeal onto a baking sheet; place dough balls on top.
8. Place baking sheet into the preheated oven. Spray the walls of the oven with water once to create steam; bake until tops are golden, for a total of 20 to 25 minutes. Cool on a wire rack.
