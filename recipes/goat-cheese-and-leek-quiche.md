## Ingredients

- 1 (9 inch) frozen single pie crust, thawed
- 3  leeks - white and light green parts only, halved lengthwise, and sliced
- 3  eggs
- ½ cup heavy whipping cream
- ½ cup milk
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives
- ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 2 ounces soft goat cheese, crumbled

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Prick pie crust all over with a fork; place on a baking sheet.
2. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden, about 15 minutes. Remove crust and set aside to cool slightly; reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees (190 degrees C).
3. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and simmer leeks just until tender, about 7 minutes; drain thoroughly.
4. Whisk eggs, heavy cream, milk, chives, nutmeg, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl. Spread leeks evenly over bottom of pie crust; dot with goat cheese. Pour egg mixture over leeks.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until puffed, lightly browned, and a sharp knife inserted near the center comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes. Remove to cool until warm or room temperature before serving.
