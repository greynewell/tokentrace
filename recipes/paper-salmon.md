## Ingredients

- 2 (5 ounce) salmon fillets or steaks
- 2 tablespoons frozen green peas
- 2 cloves garlic, crushed
- 2 dashes lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon olive oil

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Place each piece of salmon on a large (12 inch) circle of parchment paper so that they are 1 inch from the center. Cover each with a spoonful of peas, a clove of crushed garlic, a squeeze of lemon juice and a drizzle of olive oil. Fold the paper over into a packet and seal the edges by crimping and folding like a pasty. Place on a baking sheet.
3. Bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until fish is able to flake with a fork. To serve, place the packets onto serving plates and cut open the center in the shape of a cross.
