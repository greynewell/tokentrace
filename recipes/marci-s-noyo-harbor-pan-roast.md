## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1 cup chopped celery
- 1 cup sliced yellow onion
- 2  red potatoes, cubed
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 (14 ounce) cans vegetable broth
- 1 cup water
- ¼ cup heavy cream
- ½ teaspoon paprika
- ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper  (Optional)
- 1 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon sea salt
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 pound firm white fish, such as cod or halibut, cut into 2-inch chunks
- 8 ounces langostino or shrimp

## Instructions

1. Heat the butter in a stock pot over medium heat. Stir in the celery, onion, and potato; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for about 1 minute.
2. Pour in the vegetable broth and water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the potatoes are just tender, 10 to 15 minutes.
3. Combine heavy cream, paprika, cayenne pepper, black pepper, and sea salt in a small bowl. Pour 1/2 cup of hot broth into the cream mixture; stir. Whisk in the flour. Stir the cream mixture into the soup and bring to a boil. Add the fish and shellfish, cover and simmer until the fish flakes easily with a fork, about 3 to 4 minutes.
