## Ingredients

- ¼ cup balsamic vinegar
- ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil, divided
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 pinch crushed red pepper flakes
- 1 medium sweet potato, peeled
- 2 (16 ounce) packages chicken tenders
- kosher salt to taste and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 1 cup chopped asparagus
- 1 cup broccoli florets
- ½ cup halved cherry tomatoes

## Instructions

1. Whisk balsamic vinegar, 2 tablespoons olive oil, honey, mustard, garlic, and red pepper flakes in a small bowl. Set vinaigrette aside.
2. Cut sweet potato into 1/4-inch thick fries.
3. Heat remaining oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add sweet potato fries and cook, turning every 5 minutes, for 20 minutes. Remove from the pan and set aside.
4. Add chicken to the pan and season with salt and pepper. Sear until golden, about 3 minutes per side. Remove from the pan and set aside.
5. Add asparagus, broccoli, and cherry tomatoes; season with salt and pepper. Cook until asparagus and broccoli are bright green and tomatoes are slightly wilted, about 5 minutes. Move veggies to one side and add chicken and potatoes back into the pan. Pour in vinaigrette. Toss veggies and chicken slightly until chicken is cooked through and vinaigrette has thickened, about 5 more minutes.
