## Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon butter, or as needed
- 2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
- 1 cup milk
- 1 cup white sugar
- 4  eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 teaspoons cornstarch
- 1 pinch ground cinnamon, or to taste

## Instructions

2. Combine cream cheese, milk, sugar, eggs, vanilla extract, and cornstarch in a blender; blend until smooth. Pour batter into the prepared baking dish.
