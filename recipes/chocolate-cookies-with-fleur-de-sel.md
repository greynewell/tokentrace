## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup butter
- 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
- 3 large eggs
- 1 cup brown sugar
- 1 cup white sugar
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 cup chocolate chunks
- fleur de sel to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
2. Whisk flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Set aside.
3. Combine butter and chocolate chips in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat in 30-second intervals, stirring after each interval, until chocolate is melted and creamy. Add eggs one at a time, mixing well to incorporate each one. Add brown sugar, white sugar, and vanilla extract; mix well. Fold in flour mixture until no dry streaks remain. Fold in chocolate chunks.
4. Drop rounded teaspoonfuls of cookie dough onto a baking stone or nonstick cookie sheets. Sprinkle fleur de sel over the tops.
