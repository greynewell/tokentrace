## Ingredients

- 6 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- 3 pounds russet potatoes, peeled
- 6 cloves garlic, minced
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 8 (6 ounce) halibut fillets
- 2 medium lemons, thinly sliced
- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
- 2 teaspoons lemon zest
- 1 ½ teaspoons herbes de Provence
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper

## Instructions

1. Adjust the oven rack to the lower-middle position and preheat to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Brush a rimmed baking sheet with 2 tablespoons olive oil.
2. Use a food processor to slice potatoes 3/16 inch thick. Transfer to a bowl and toss with remaining olive oil and garlic. Overlap potatoes tightly in 5 rows lengthwise on the prepared baking sheet. Season with salt and pepper.
3. Bake in the preheated oven, rotating the baking sheet halfway through, until spotty brown and just tender, 35 to 40 minutes.
4. While potatoes are baking, make herb butter by mashing butter, lemon zest, herbes de Provence, garlic powder, salt, and pepper together in a small bowl. Set aside.
5. Rinse halibut fillets and pat dry with paper towels. Season with salt and pepper and rub herb butter evenly over the top of each fillet.
6. Remove potatoes from the oven. Carefully arrange fillets over the potatoes and top with lemon slices.
7. Return to the oven and roast until fish flakes easily when gently prodded with a paring knife, about 15 minutes.
8. Gently cut potatoes in squares around each fillet and lift onto individual serving plates.
