## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups mochiko (glutinous rice flour)
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 ½ cups water
- 2 drops distilled white vinegar
- ½ cup potato starch
- ¼ cup white sugar
- ¼ teaspoon salt

## Instructions

1. In a medium bowl, mix together the mochiko, 1 cup of sugar, and water until well blended. Mix in the 2 drops of vinegar to soften. Pour into a microwave-safe dish, and loosely cover with plastic. Microwave for 8 to 10 minutes on HIGH. Remove, and let cool until cool enough to handle.
2. In a small bowl, combine the potato starch, 1/4 cup sugar, and salt. Turn the mochi out onto the plastic, and cut into pieces using a plastic or wooden knife. Metal knives tend to stick too much. Roll the pieces in the potato starch mixture.
