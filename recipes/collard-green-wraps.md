## Ingredients

- ¼ cup apple cider vinegar
- 3 tablespoons kosher salt
- 1 bunch collard greens
- 1 (10 ounce) container roasted garlic hummus
- 1 large red bell pepper, thinly sliced
- ½ small seedless cucumber, cut into sticks
- 1 medium red onion, thinly sliced
- 1 (14 ounce) can artichoke hearts, drained and quartered
- 1 cup packed baby arugula
- 2 teaspoons freshly squeezed lemon juice

## Instructions

1. Fill a large pot with 3 inches of water. Add vinegar and salt; bring to a boil over medium-high heat.
2. While water comes to a boil, remove 4 large leaves from the bunch of collard greens. Lay them flat on a cutting board and trim the stems until even with beginning of leaves. Carefully shave center stems down until leaves lay flat, being careful to not tear them.
3. Place leaves in boiling water and cook undisturbed until bright green and wilted, about 30 seconds. Use tongs to carefully transfer leaves to a bowl of ice water; let cool 3 minutes. Remove from ice water and pat dry.
4. Lay collard leaves flat on a large cutting board and assemble wraps as follows, dividing ingredients evenly among the 4 leaves. Spread an even layer of hummus on each leaf, leaving a 2-inch border. In the bottom third of each leaf, stack bell pepper, cucumber, onion, artichoke hearts, and arugula. Drizzle with lemon juice.
5. Fold the sides of each leaf in towards the center, using your hands to help keep the sides tucked in, and roll, starting from bottom. Slice in half diagonally to serve.
