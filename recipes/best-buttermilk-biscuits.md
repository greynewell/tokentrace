## Ingredients

- 2 ¼ cups self-rising flour
- ¼ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ cup butter-flavored shortening (such as Crisco®)
- 1 cup buttermilk

## Instructions

1. Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
2. Sift flour and baking soda together in a large bowl; cut in shortening with a knife or pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Make a well in the center of the mixture and stir in buttermilk until a soft ball forms. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 2 to 3 minutes. Roll dough out to a 1/2-inch-thick rectangle.
3. Cut biscuits out with biscuit cutter and transfer to a baking sheet.
4. Bake in preheated oven until tops are light brown and sides begin to darken, about 10 minutes. Remove biscuits to cool completely on a wire rack.
