## Ingredients

- 1 pound ground chicken
- ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 large egg, beaten
- 5 cloves garlic, minced, divided
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
- ¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 1 pinch kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 4 tablespoons salted butter
- 1 pound zucchini noodles
- ½  lemon, juiced
- 1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Mix ground chicken, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, egg, 2 garlic cloves, parsley, and red pepper flakes together in a large bowl. Season with kosher salt and black pepper and form into tablespoon-sized meatballs.
2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook meatballs until golden brown on all sides and no longer pink in the centers, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a plate and wipe the skillet with a paper towel.
3. Melt butter in the same skillet; add remaining 3 garlic cloves and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add zucchini noodles to the skillet and toss into the garlic butter; squeeze in lemon juice. Add meatballs and heat just until warmed through. Garnish with remaining Parmesan cheese to serve.
