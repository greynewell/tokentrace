## Ingredients

- 2 teaspoons dried rosemary
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 4 (6 ounce) boneless center-cut pork loin chops, trimmed of fat
- 2 cloves garlic, chopped
- 1 cup low-sodium beef broth

## Instructions

1. Combine rosemary, ground pepper, and salt in a small bowl; rub rosemary mixture on pork chops.
2. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat; stir garlic into melted butter, then place pork chops in the skillet. Cook until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes per side.
3. Reduce heat to low and pour in beef broth. Simmer until pork chops are fully cooked, 35 to 45 minutes. A meat thermometer inserted into the center of the thickest chop should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
