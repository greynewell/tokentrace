## Ingredients

- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 ½ pounds trimmed leeks, cleaned and thinly cut
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste
- 1 ¼ pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled, cut into eighths
- 3 cups chicken or vegetable broth, or more as needed to adjust thickness
- 1 cup heavy cream
- ½ cup creme fraiche
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper
