## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 4 (4 ounce) skin-on salmon fillets
- ground black pepper to taste
- ¼ cup butter
- ⅓ cup olive oil
- ¼ cup white cooking wine
- ¼ cup crushed garlic
- 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon onion salt
- 1 tablespoon ground mustard
- 3 dashes hot pepper sauce (such as Tabasco®)
- ¾ cup honey, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray.
2. Place salmon fillets skin-side down on the baking sheet; pierce with a fork several times. Season with black pepper.
3. Melt butter in a small saucepan over low heat. Whisk olive oil, white cooking wine, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, onion salt, mustard, and hot pepper sauce into the melted butter; cook until heated through, about 5 minutes. Brush generously over the salmon fillets.
4. Bake salmon fillets in the preheated oven, basting with butter mixture every 5 minutes, until salmon flakes easily with a fork, about 15 minutes. Coat each fillet with honey; continue baking until glazed, 3 to 5 minutes.
