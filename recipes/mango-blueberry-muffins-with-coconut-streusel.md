## Ingredients

- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- ¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon  (Optional)
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 3 tablespoons sweetened flaked coconut, chopped
- 1 pinch salt
- 2 tablespoons butter
- ½ cup unsalted butter
- 1 ¼ cups white sugar
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 2  eggs
- 1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour

- ½ cup buttermilk
- 1 cup fresh blueberries

## Instructions

1. Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 16 muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners.
2. Combine 1/4 cup flour, the cinnamon, 1 tablespoon sugar, the coconut, and 1 pinch of salt in a small bowl. Mix in 2 tablespoons of butter until completely incorporated into the flour; set aside.
3. Beat the unsalted butter, 1 1/4 cups sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Beat the first egg into the butter until completely blended before adding the second; continue mixing until light and fluffy. Combine 1 3/4 cups of flour with the baking powder. Stir into the butter mixture alternately with the buttermilk. Toss the blueberries with 1/4 cup of flour; stir into the batter along with the mango.
