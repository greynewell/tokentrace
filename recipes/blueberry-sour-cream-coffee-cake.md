## Ingredients

- 1 cup butter, softened
- 2 cups white sugar
- 2  eggs
- 1 cup sour cream
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 ⅝ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup fresh or frozen blueberries
- ½ cup brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ½ cup chopped pecans
- 1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar for dusting

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9-inch Bundt pan.
2. Beat sugar and butter together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in sour cream and vanilla extract.
3. Combine flour, baking powder, and salt; stir into butter mixture until just blended. Fold in blueberries; spoon 1/2 of the batter into the prepared pan.
4. Combine brown sugar, pecans, and cinnamon in a small bowl; sprinkle 1/2 of the mixture over batter in the pan. Spoon remaining batter on top, then sprinkle over remaining pecan mixture. Use a knife or thin spatula to swirl the sugar layer into the cake.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool briefly on a wire rack. Invert carefully onto a serving plate; dust with confectioners' sugar just before serving.
