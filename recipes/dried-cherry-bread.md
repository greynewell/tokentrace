## Ingredients

- ½ cup dried cherries
- 2  eggs
- ¾ cup white sugar
- ½ cup vegetable oil
- ¼ cup melted butter, cooled
- ¼ cup buttermilk
- 1 (6 ounce) container cherry vanilla-flavored yogurt
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 cup instant oatmeal
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup white chocolate baking chips, lightly dusted with flour

## Instructions

1. Pour boiling water over dried cherries in a bowl and let sit to plump up for 15 minutes. Drain.
2. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
3. Beat eggs lightly in a bowl. Add sugar, oil, butter, buttermilk, yogurt, and vanilla extract. Whisk well.
4. Combine flour, oatmeal, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a separate, larger bowl. Whisk well. Add egg mixture, white chocolate chips, and cherries. Stir just until combined. Don't overmix. Pour into the prepared loaf pan.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 45 minutes to 1 hour, checking at 35 minutes to account for different ovens. If bread begins to brown too much, lightly cover the top with aluminum foil. Let set for 5 to 10 minutes in the pan before inverting loaf onto a wire rack to cool completely.
