## Ingredients

- 1 (15 ounce) can sliced beets, drained
- 2 large eggs
- 2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
- 2 cups white sugar
- ½ cup unsweetened dark cocoa powder
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ cup salted butter, melted

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease the bottom of a 10-inch round cake pan.
2. Puree beets in a food processor or blender until the consistency is smooth and no lumps remain. Add eggs and blend for a few seconds more.
