## Ingredients

- 4 tablespoons Carapelli Premium 100% Italian Extra Virgin Olive Oil, divided

- 1 ½ teaspoons coarse sea salt or kosher salt, divided
- ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 (2 pound) center-cut beef tenderloin roast

1. Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Combine 2 tablespoons of Carapelli, garlic, thyme, rosemary, 1 teaspoon of the salt and pepper; set aside.
2. Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Add roast; cook 2 to 3 minutes or until well browned. Turn roast over; turn off heat. Spread garlic and herb mixture evenly over top and sides of roast.
