## Ingredients

- 2 ½ teaspoons active dry yeast
- 3 ¼ cups bread flour
- ¾ teaspoon bread improver
- ¼ cup sugar
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons margarine
- 2  eggs
- 1 cup canned evaporated milk
- 1 cup canned evaporated milk
- ½ cup dry bread crumbs

## Instructions

1. Place the yeast, bread flour, bread improver, sugar, salt, margarine, eggs, and 1 cup of evaporated milk into a bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Select the Dough cycle, and press start.
2. When the cycle has ended, remove the dough from the machine, and form into 2 inch balls. Dip each ball in the remaining evaporated milk, then in the dry bread crumbs. Place the rolls on a baking sheet crumb-side up. Cover loosely with a cloth or plastic, and let rise until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.
