## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- ½ cup dark cocoa powder (such as Hershey's® Special Dark)
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 1 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar
- ½ cup white sugar
- 2 large eggs, at room temperature
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- ½ teaspoon peppermint extract
- 1 cup chopped chocolate peppermint bark
- ¾ cup chopped pecans
- ¼ cup crushed candy canes

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
2. Whisk flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl until combined.
3. Combine butter, brown sugar, and white sugar in a large bowl and beat with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add eggs, vanilla, and peppermint extract and mix until thoroughly combined. Mix in half of the dry ingredients until just combined. Mix in remaining dry ingredients until just combined. Fold in peppermint bark pieces, pecans, and crushed candy cane pieces.
4. Place 1 tablespoon-sized balls of dough 1 1/2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets.
