## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons soy sauce
- 3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- ½ teaspoon paprika
- salt to taste
- 1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breast, cut into strips
- 1  red bell pepper, cubed
- 1 bunch scallions, trimmed and sliced into 1/2-inch lengths
- 1 (12 ounce) can pineapple chunks, drained and juice reserved
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch

## Instructions

1. Combine soy sauce, 2 tablespoons olive oil, paprika, and salt in a bowl. Add chicken strips and let marinate while preparing the remaining ingredients.
2. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a wok over medium-high heat. Add bell pepper and stir-fry for 3 minutes. Add scallions and cook for 2 more minutes. Remove chicken from marinade and add to the wok; discard marinade. Cook, stirring occasionally, until chicken is cooked through and no longer pink in the center, 10 to 15 minutes.
3. Combine pineapple juice and cornstarch in a bowl; mix together. Add pineapple chunks to the skillet and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in pineapple juice mixture and bring to a boil. Simmer until sauce has thickened, about 3 minutes.
