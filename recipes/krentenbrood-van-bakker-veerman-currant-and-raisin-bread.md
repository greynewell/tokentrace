## Ingredients

- 3 ½ cups dried currants
- 3 cups raisins
- ½ cup candied peel
- 7 ¼ cups bread flour
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 4 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
- 2 teaspoons white sugar
- 1 cup lukewarm water (113 degrees F (45 degrees C)), divided
- 1 cup milk, at room temperature
- 2  eggs
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 teaspoons butter

## Instructions

1. Soak currants and raisins in a bowl of warm water for 30 minutes. Drain and pat dry with paper towels; stir in candied peel.
2. Sift flour and cinnamon into a large bowl. Make a well in the center of the flour. Add yeast and sugar to the well; pour in 1/4 cup lukewarm water. Let stand until yeast begins to foam, about 5 minutes.
3. Stir remaining 3/4 cup lukewarm water, milk, eggs, and salt into the flour mixture until dough comes together.
4. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Add currant mixture; knead until evenly incorporated and dough is smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and cover with a damp cloth. Let rise in a warm place until doubled, 45 minutes to 1 hour.
5. Grease two 9x5-inch loaf pans lightly with butter. Flatten dough gently and shape into 2 loaves. Place 1 loaf in each pan and cover with a damp cloth. Let rise in a warm place until puffy, about 45 minutes.
6. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
7. Bake loaves in the preheated oven until firm and dark brown, about 45 minutes. Invert onto a wire rack to cool completely before slicing, about 1 hour.
