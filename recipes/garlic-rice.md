## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 ½ tablespoons chopped garlic
- 2 tablespoons ground pork

## Instructions

1. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add the garlic and ground pork. Cook and stir until the garlic is golden brown. This is the color you want for maximum flavor, do not allow it to burn, or the flavor will be bitter.
