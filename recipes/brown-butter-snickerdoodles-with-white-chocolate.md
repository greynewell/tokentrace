## Ingredients

- 1 cup unsalted butter
- ½ (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- 1 cup white sugar
- ⅓ cup light brown sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1 large egg yolk
- 1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons cream of tartar
- 1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- 4 (1 ounce) squares white chocolate, coarsely chopped
- ⅓ cup white sugar
- 1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon

## Instructions

1. Melt butter for cookies in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring often, until the milk solids turn golden brown and the butter smells nutty, 10 to 12 minutes. Pour butter and any browned bits into a small bowl.
2. Place in the refrigerator until butter resolidifies but is still soft, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
3. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
4. Remove brown butter from the refrigerator and place in a large mixing bowl. Add cream cheese and beat with an electric mixer until fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add white and brown sugars; beat until combined and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes more. Mix in egg, egg yolk, and vanilla extract at medium speed until incorporated.
5. Whisk flour, cream of tartar, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt together in a separate bowl. Gradually add flour mixture to the butter mixture, beating until just combined, and adding chocolate in with the last bit of flour.
6. Whisk sugar and cinnamon for coating together in a shallow dish.
7. Scoop cookie dough into 1 1/2- to 2-tablespoon portions and roll each into a ball. Roll each ball in the coating and arrange 3 inches apart on the prepared baking sheet.
8. Bake in the preheated oven until set, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
