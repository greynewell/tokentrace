## Ingredients

- 1 thick slice fully cooked ham with bone
- 2 tablespoons butter, divided
- 1  onion, diced
- 2  carrots, diced
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 (16 ounce) can great northern beans, undrained
- 2 cups water, or as needed
- 2  bay leaves
- 1 teaspoon salt

## Instructions

1. Cut ham off bone in bite-size pieces, reserving bone. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a skillet over medium heat and fry ham pieces in hot butter until lightly browned, about 4 minutes.
