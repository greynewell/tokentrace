## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 1 package active dry yeast
- ¼ cup warm water
- 4 cups all-purpose flour
- ½ cup hot water
- ½ cup milk
- ¼ cup salted butter, softened
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt

## Instructions

1. Spray a cookie sheet with cooking spray.
2. Dissolve yeast in warm water in a large mixing bowl. Add 2 cups flour, hot water, milk, butter, sugar, egg, and salt. Blend on low speed until moist, then beat on medium speed for 2 minutes.

5. Divide dough into golf ball-sized pieces. Place 1 layer of dough pieces in the prepared pan and top with some filling. Continue to later dough and filling until you've used them up. Cover with a piece of plastic wrap that's been sprayed with cooking spray. Let rise in a warm place until light and doubled in size, 45 to 60 minutes.
6. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
