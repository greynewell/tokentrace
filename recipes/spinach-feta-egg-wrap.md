## Ingredients

- 1 large whole-wheat tortilla
- 1 ½ teaspoons coconut oil
- 1 cup chopped baby spinach leaves
- 1  oil-packed sun-dried tomato, chopped
- 2  eggs, beaten
- ⅓ cup feta cheese
- 1  tomato, diced

## Instructions

1. Warm tortilla in a large skillet over medium heat.
2. Melt coconut oil in a separate skillet over medium-high heat. Saute spinach and tomato in hot oil until spinach wilts, about 1 minute. Add eggs and scramble until almost set, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle feta cheese over eggs and continue cooking until cheese melts, about 1 minute more.
