## Ingredients

- ¼ cup cold butter, cut into small pieces
- ½ cup all-purpose flour
- ¼ cup packed brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ½ cup quick cooking oats
- 1 ¼ cups white sugar
- ½ cup butter, softened
- 2  eggs

## Instructions

1. Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 loaf pans, 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 inches.
2. To make the streusel topping, mix 1/4 cup of cut-up butter, 1/2 cup flour, brown sugar, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, and oats in a bowl until crumbly. Set aside.
3. Cream the sugar and butter together in a bowl, and stir in the eggs. Add the bananas, buttermilk, and vanilla extract, and stir until the mixture is well blended. Beat in the flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking powder, cinnamon, and nuts.
4. Scoop the batter into the prepared loaf pans. Sprinkle the top of each loaf with half the streusel topping.
