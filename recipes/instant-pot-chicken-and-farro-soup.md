## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons avocado oil
- 2 cups carrots that have been sliced lengthwise and cut into 3/4-inch slices
- 1 cup sliced celery with leaves
- 1 medium leek, halved lengthwise and sliced
- 1 ½ teaspoons minced garlic
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 1 teaspoon ground thyme
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon dried parsley
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 5 cups low-sodium chicken broth
- 1 cup farro, rinsed

## Instructions

1. Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and select Saute function. Heat oil in the hot pot and add carrots, celery, and leek. Cook, stirring frequently, until vegetables start to soften, 3 to 4 minutes. Add garlic and cook until just fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add tomato paste and cook for 1 minute. Stir in thyme, oregano, parsley, salt, and pepper. Pour broth into the pot, add farro, and stir. Push chicken breasts down into the liquid. Close and lock the lid.
2. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 12 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
3. Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions for 10 minutes. Release remaining pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Transfer chicken to a clean work surface and roughly chop; return to the pot and stir. Taste and adjust salt. Serve.
