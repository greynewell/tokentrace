## Ingredients

- 3 cups all-purpose flour, or as needed
- ¼ cup instant potato flakes
- ¼ cup dry milk powder
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 2 teaspoons instant yeast
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 cup warm water, or as needed
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 4 tablespoons butter, melted
- 4 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste
- ¼ teaspoon dried parsley
- ¼ teaspoon Italian seasoning

## Instructions

1. Mix flour, potato flakes, milk powder, sugar, yeast, salt, and garlic powder in a large bowl. Stir in water and olive oil until dough comes together. Knead until dough is smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Add additional water or flour as needed.
2. Place dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover, and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour.
3. Punch down dough and divide into 16 equal pieces. Roll each piece of dough into an 8- to 10-inch rope. Tie each rope into a knot, tucking ends underneath. Arrange knots on greased baking sheets. Cover and let rise until puffy, 30 to 45 minutes.
4. Mix melted butter, garlic, parsley, and Italian seasoning together and set aside.
5. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Brush knots with garlic butter mixture.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 18 minutes. Remove from oven and brush with remaining garlic butter mixture if desired.
