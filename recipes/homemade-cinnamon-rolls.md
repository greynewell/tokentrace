## Ingredients

- ½ cup milk
- ½ cup water
- ¼ cup butter
- 3 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
- ½ cup white sugar
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 (.25 ounce) package rapid-rise yeast
- 1  egg
- ¼ cup butter, softened
- 1 cup light brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
- 3 ounces cream cheese, softened
- 1 tablespoon butter, softened
- 1 tablespoon milk
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 cups confectioners' sugar

## Instructions

1. Heat milk, water, and 1/4 cup butter together in a saucepan over medium heat until bubbling, about 5 minutes. Let cool to 120 to 130 degrees F (49 to 54 degrees C), 1 to 2 minutes.
2. Mix flour, white sugar, salt, and yeast together in a separate bowl. Mix egg into warm milk mixture.
3. Pour milk mixture and 1/3 of the flour mixture into a mixing bowl; beat using an electric mixer until moistened. Add remaining dry ingredients slowly until a dough has pulled together. Knead on a lightly floured surface for 8 minutes. Place in a covered bowl and let rise in a dry, warm place until doubled in size, 1 to 2 hours.
4. Punch dough down. Roll on a lightly floured surface into a 16x12-inch rectangle. Spread 1/4 cup softened butter evenly over dough. Mix brown sugar and cinnamon together in small bowl and sprinkle evenly over dough. Roll up from the short side; cut into 12 even rolls.
5. Place rolls into a greased 9x13-inch glass baking dish. Cover and let rise in a dry, warm place, 8 hours, to overnight.
6. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
7. Bake in the preheated oven until golden, about 17 minutes.
8. Meanwhile, beat cream cheese, 1 tablespoon butter, milk, and vanilla extract for icing using an electric mixer in a bowl until creamy; slowly mix in confectioners' sugar until smooth.
9. Remove cinnamon rolls from the oven and flip out onto a cooling rack; let cool slightly, 5 to 10 minutes, before covering in icing.
