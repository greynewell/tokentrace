## Ingredients

- 5 pounds chicken wings, separated at joints, tips discarded
- 1 tablespoon seasoned salt
- 2 tablespoons garlic powder
- 2 tablespoons onion powder
- 2 tablespoons ground black pepper
- 1 tablespoon monosodium glutamate (MSG, or Accent flavor enhancer)  (Optional)
- 3 tablespoons prepared yellow mustard
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 quart oil for frying, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Season chicken wings on both sides with garlic powder, onion powder, pepper, seasoned salt, and MSG.
2. Use a basting brush to coat each wing with a thin layer of mustard. Pour flour into a plastic bag, add chicken, and shake to coat.
3. Heat oil in a deep fryer or heavy skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
4. Cook chicken in hot oil until no longer pink and the juices run clear, about 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Allow to cool for 5 minutes before serving.
