## Ingredients

- 1 ¼ cups brown sugar
- ½ cup butter, softened
- 2  eggs
- 5  very ripe bananas, mashed
- 2 teaspoons lemon juice
- ½ cup milk
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ½ cup white sugar
- ⅓ cup all-purpose flour
- ¼ cup unsalted butter, cubed
- 1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a large loaf pan.
2. Mash together the brown sugar and 1/2 cup of softened butter until smooth and creamy in a large bowl; beat in the eggs. In a bowl, combine the mashed bananas with lemon juice, and add them to the butter-sugar mixture. Beat in the milk and vanilla extract until smooth.
3. In a bowl, whisk together 2 1/2 cups of flour, baking soda, salt, and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon. Mix the flour mixture into the banana mixture in 2 or 3 increments, beating well after each addition. Scrape the batter into the prepared loaf pan.
4. Mix together the white sugar, 1/3 cup of flour, 1/4 cup of unsalted butter, and 1 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon with a fork until the mixture is crumbly. Spoon the crumble mixture over the loaf.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until the bread is lightly browned and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 45 minutes to 1 hour.
