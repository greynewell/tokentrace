## Ingredients

- oil for deep frying
- ¼ cup brown sugar, or as needed
- 6 large bananas, halved crosswise and then lengthwise
- 24  lumpia wrappers, defrosted
- 1 tablespoon water, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Place brown sugar in a shallow bowl. Roll each banana quarter in the brown sugar until coated. Wrap a lumpia wrapper around each coated banana, sealing the last edge to the roll using a spoon or your finger dipped in water. Repeat with the remaining bananas and wrappers.
3. Working in batches, fry lumpia in the hot oil until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer cooked lumpia to a paper towel-lined plate using a slotted spoon. Some sugar may leak out the sides of the lumpia while cooling.
