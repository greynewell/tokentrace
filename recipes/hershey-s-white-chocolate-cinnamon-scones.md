## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a cookie sheet with non-stick cooking spray.
2. Sift 2 cups flour, 1/4 cup sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt into a large bowl. Stir in lemon peel. Cut butter in with a pastry blender or fork until the mixture is resembles cornmeal. Mix in 1/2 cup HERSHEY'S Cinnamon Chips.
3. In a small bowl, whisk together sour cream, egg yolk, and vanilla. Stir in 1/2 cup melted HERSHEY'S HUGS . Mix into flour and butter mixture, and mix until dough comes together in moist clumps. Gather dough into ball.
