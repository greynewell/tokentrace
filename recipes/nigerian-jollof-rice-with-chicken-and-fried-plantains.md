## Ingredients

- 2 pounds chicken drumsticks
- ½ large onion, diced
- 1 (2 inch) piece fresh ginger root, peeled and thinly sliced
- 2 cubes  chicken bouillon, crushed
- 2 cloves garlic, diced
- 1 tablespoon curry powder, or more to taste
- 1 teaspoon herbes de Provence
- freshly ground black pepper
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper
- 1 cup water
- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
- ½ large onion, diced
- 1 (14 ounce) can tomato sauce
- 1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk
- 1 teaspoon herbes de Provence
- 1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste
- 3 cups parboiled rice (such as Uncle Ben's®)
- 1 (10 ounce) package frozen mixed vegetables (carrots, corn, peas)
- 4  ripe plantains, peeled and cut diagonally into 1/2-inch slices
- ½ cup canola oil for frying

## Instructions

1. Place chicken drumsticks in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add 1/2 onion, ginger, crushed bouillon cubes, garlic, curry powder, 1 teaspoon herbes de Provence, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Mix well. Cook until chicken starts sticking to the bottom, about 5 minutes. Pour in water, mix, cover the pot, and bring to a gentle simmer; cook for 15 minutes. Remove from heat.
2. Transfer chicken to a baking dish using a slotted spoon. Strain cooking liquid through a fine-mesh sieve. Reserve 1 1/2 cups liquid. Discard solids.
3. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
4. Bake chicken in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the middle and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
5. Heat 3 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large pot over medium-low heat and cook 1/2 onion until soft and translucent but not browned, about 5 minutes. Add tomato sauce; cook and stir until slightly thickened and infused into the oil, 5 to 7 minutes.
6. Stir reserved chicken broth, coconut milk, 1 teaspoon herbes de Provence, salt, and pepper into the pot. Bring to a simmer; add rice. Cook, stirring often, until rice is almost tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Add frozen vegetables and continue cooking until rice is tender and creamy, about 5 minutes.
7. Heat 1/2 cup of canola oil in a nonstick pan over medium heat. Add plantains and fry on both sides until golden and crispy, about 2 to 3 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels. Garnish jollof rice with friend plantains and serve with chicken.
