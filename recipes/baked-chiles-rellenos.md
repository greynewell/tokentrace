## Ingredients

- 8 medium poblano peppers
- 4 large eggs
- ½ cup all-purpose flour
- ⅓ cup milk
- ½ teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 (12 ounce) package queso fresco
- 1 (8 ounce) package shredded Cheddar cheese

## Instructions

1. Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
2. Roast peppers on the top rack of the preheated oven until the skins are charred, about 5 minutes per side. Remove from the oven and allow to cool enough to handle, about 10 minutes. Set the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
3. While peppers are cooling, whisk eggs, flour, milk, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl until smooth. Slice the queso fresco into eight even rectangles, just shorter than the length of the peppers.
4. Carefully peel off the waxy skin of the cooled peppers. Gently cut a slit down the length of the peppers and use a spoon to remove the seeds and membranes.
5. Spread about 1/4 cup of the milk mixture on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Wrap each pepper around a queso fresco rectangle. Place each chile/cheese wrap seam-side down in a single layer in the baking dish. Cover with remaining egg mixture. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese over the top.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until the egg mixture has risen and the cheese is golden brown, about 30 minutes.
