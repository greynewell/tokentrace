## Ingredients

- 1 quart strawberries
- 1 (6 ounce) package cherry-flavored gelatin (such as JELL-O®)
- 1 ½ cups boiling water
- 1 cup cold water
- 1 cup ice cubes, or as needed
- 1 (12 ounce) package pound cake, cut into 12 slices
- 1 ⅓ cups blueberries, divided
- 2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese (such as Philadelphia®), softened
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 1 (8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed

## Instructions

1. Slice 1 cup of strawberries and halve remaining 3 cups.
2. Pour gelatin into a heat-proof bowl and add boiling water. Stir until completely dissolved, at least 2 minutes. Pour cold water into a 2-cup measure and add enough ice cubes to bring level to 2 cups. Add cold water and ice to gelatin and stir until melted. Refrigerate until slightly thickened to the consistency of unbeaten egg whites, about 5 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, line a 13x9-inch baking dish with sliced pound cake.
4. Remove gelatin from the refrigerator and stir in sliced strawberries and 1 cup blueberries. Spoon mixture over cake slices in the baking dish. Refrigerate until firm, about 4 hours.
5. Beat cream cheese and sugar together in a bowl until smooth. Stir in whipped topping and spread mixture over gelatin in the baking dish. Arrange sliced strawberries and remaining blueberries to create an American flag.
