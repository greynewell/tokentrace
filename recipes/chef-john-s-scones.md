## Ingredients

- 1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 4 teaspoons baking powder
- ⅛ teaspoon salt
- 5 tablespoons unsalted butter
- ½ cup milk
- ¼ cup sour cream
- ⅓ cup dried currants
- 1  egg, lightly beaten
- 1 tablespoon milk

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a mixing bowl. Cut in butter with a knife or pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
3. Stir together 1/2 cup milk, currants, and sour cream in a small bowl; stir into flour mixture with a fork until just moistened and holding together.
4. Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface and pat into a rectangle. Fold the rectangle into thirds. Turn dough a half turn, gather any crumbs, and flatten back into a rectangle; repeat once more. Cut the rectangle into eight triangular pieces and transfer to a silicone baking mat.
