## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- ⅔ cup almond milk
- 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar
- ½ cup vegan margarine (such as Earth Balance®), softened
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 6 cups fresh peaches - peeled, pitted, and sliced
- ¼ cup brown sugar
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch

- ¼ teaspoon salt

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Coat a 9-inch square baking pan with nonstick cooking spray.
2. Combine almond milk and vinegar in a small bowl. Set aside for 5 minutes.
3. Beat margarine and 2 tablespoons white sugar together using an electric mixer in a large bowl until creamy.
