## Ingredients

- 4 large chicken thighs with skin
- 2 tablespoons ground black pepper, divided
- 1 tablespoon garlic powder
- 1 tablespoon paprika
- 1 tablespoon ground cumin
- 2 teaspoons salt, divided
- 4 tablespoons peanut oil
- 5 tablespoons butter
- ⅓ cup honey
- 1 tablespoon sriracha sauce
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 2 teaspoons lime juice
- 4  potatoes, chopped
- 2  carrots, chopped
- 1 large yellow onion, chopped
- 1  turnip, chopped
- 1 head garlic, peeled
- ¾ cup red wine

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Pat chicken dry. Combine 1 tablespoon black pepper, garlic powder, paprika, cumin, and 1 teaspoon salt in a bowl. Rub the mixture on the chicken.
3. Heat a cast iron skillet over high heat. Add peanut oil to the hot skillet and watch it carefully; when oil smokes, add chicken, skin-side down. Cook until browned, about 4 minutes each side. Transfer chicken to a plate; reserve drippings in the skillet.
4. Melt butter in a small saucepan. Add honey, sriracha sauce, soy sauce, and lime juice. Add remaining black pepper and salt. Bring sauce to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until thickened, about 5 minutes.
5. Return skillet with drippings to medium-high heat. Add potatoes, carrots, onion, turnip, and garlic. Cook and stir until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat. Add chicken on top of the vegetables, skin-side up. Coat with about a third of the sauce.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Add wine to the skillet and coat chicken with another third of the sauce. Cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the meat near the bone reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C) and vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes. Coat chicken with remaining sauce before serving.
