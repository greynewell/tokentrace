## Ingredients

- 1  skin-on trout, boned
- 2  onions, finely chopped, divided
- 1 (12 fluid ounce) bottle light-colored beer
- 1  lemon, sliced
- ¼ pound salt pork, cubed
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 3 stalks celery, diced
- 2 (14.5 ounce) cans chicken stock
- 2  potatoes, cubed
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 2 cups heavy whipping cream
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives

## Instructions

1. Place trout, 1 onion, beer, and lemon in a heavy bottomed pot. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium and cook until trout easily flakes with a fork, about 15 minutes. Transfer trout to a flat work surface and remove skin. Discard beer, onion, and lemon.
2. Place salt pork in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 5 minutes. Reserve drippings and drain salt pork on paper towels.
3. Melt butter in the skillet. Add remaining onion and celery; saute until almost tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer to the pot. Stir in chicken stock, potatoes, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes.
4. Place trout, salt pork, and heavy cream into the pot. Cook until chowder is heated through, about 5 minutes. Garnish with parsley and chives.
