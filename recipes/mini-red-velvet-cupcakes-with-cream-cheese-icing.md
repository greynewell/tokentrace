## Ingredients

- 2 ½ cups sifted all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ cups white sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 ½ cups vegetable oil
- 1 cup buttermilk
- 2 large eggs
- 2 tablespoons red food coloring
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon white vinegar
- 3 (6 ounce) packages cream cheese, at room temperature
- 1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 3 cups sifted confectioners' sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 30 mini muffin cups.
2. Sift flour, sugar, salt, baking soda, and cocoa powder together in a bowl.
3. Beat oil, buttermilk, eggs, food coloring, vanilla extract, and vinegar together in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Slowly add the flour mixture; beat on low speed until batter is just moistened and still airy. Pour batter into the muffin cups.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean, about 15 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Run a table knife around the edges to loosen. Invert cupcakes carefully onto a serving plate or cooling rack. Let cool, about 15 minutes.
5. Beat cream cheese and butter together in a clean stand mixer bowl. Slowly add confectioners' sugar and vanilla extract. Mix on low until smooth. Spread icing over cooled cupcakes.
