## Ingredients

- 1 (6 ounce) can fancy crabmeat, drained
- 4 ounces cream cheese, softened
- ½ stalk celery, diced
- 1  green onion, chopped
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- ½ teaspoon seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®)
- 8  whole dill pickles, halved lengthwise
- 8  egg roll wrappers
- vegetable oil for frying

## Instructions

1. Combine crabmeat, cream cheese, celery, green onion, Worcestershire sauce, and seafood seasoning in a mixing bowl. Stir until evenly combined.
2. Use a spoon to scoop out and discard the seeds from each pickle half to create 16 boats. Spoon a tablespoon of cream cheese mixture into one pickle boat and top with the the other half of the pickle to seal. Repeat with remaining pickles and cream cheese mixture.
3. Place an egg roll wrapper on a clean surface in diamond shape with one corner facing you. Top with a stuffed pickle. Fold up bottom half of wrapper and tightly fold in sides. Gently roll and seal with a couple drops of water. Repeat with remaining wrappers and pickles.
4. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place 4 egg rolls in the hot oil and cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Remove egg rolls using tongs and place on a paper towel-lined plate. Repeat with remaining egg rolls.
