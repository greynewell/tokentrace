## Ingredients

- ½ cup hot red pepper sauce
- ½ cup brown sugar, or to taste
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 (2 pound) boneless salmon fillet
- ¼ cup chopped green onions
- 1 pinch salt
- 1 pinch freshly ground black pepper

## Instructions

1. Stir together the hot sauce, brown sugar, butter, honey, and lemon juice in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir continuously for 3 to 4 minutes, until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture is well blended. Remove from heat, and set aside.
2. Coat a casserole dish with olive oil. Poke holes in the salmon with a fork, then place into the dish. Pour reserved sauce over the fish, top with green onions, and season with salt and pepper. Marinate for 30 minutes.
3. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 C).
4. Bake salmon in preheated oven, uncovered, until the fish flakes easily with a fork, about 25 minutes.
