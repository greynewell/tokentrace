## Ingredients

- 1 medium head garlic, halved crosswise
- 1 (3 1/2) pound butternut squash, halved lengthwise and seeded
- 1 medium onion, quartered
- 1 medium leek, white portion only, chopped
- 1 (1 1/2 inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled
- 4 cups chicken broth, divided
- 1 cup coconut milk
- 1 teaspoon curry powder, or more to taste
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
2. Wrap each garlic half in foil and place on the prepared baking sheet. Add squash, cut-sides down. Add onion, leek, and ginger.
3. Roast in the preheated oven until vegetables are golden and squash skin is easily pierced with a fork, 45 minutes to 1 hour.
4. Squeeze out roasted garlic cloves and scoop out squash flesh into a food processor or blender with onion, leek, and ginger. Add 2 cups broth and puree (in batches if necessary) until smooth. Transfer to a soup pot.
5. Place the pot over medium heat and add remaining broth. Whisk in coconut milk, curry powder, and cayenne pepper. Season with salt and black pepper, and cook until heated through, about 15 minutes.
