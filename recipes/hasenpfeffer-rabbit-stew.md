## Ingredients

- 3 pounds rabbit meat, cleaned and cut into pieces
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ⅓ cup all-purpose flour
- ½ pound bacon, diced
- ½ cup finely chopped shallots
- 1 clove garlic, finely chopped
- 1 cup dry red wine
- 1 cup water
- 1 tablespoon chicken bouillon granules
- 1 tablespoon currant jelly
- 10  black peppercorns, crushed
- 1  bay leaf
- ¼ teaspoon dried rosemary, crushed
- 2 teaspoons lemon juice
- 3 tablespoons water
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- ⅛ teaspoon dried thyme, crushed

## Instructions

1. Place bacon in a large skillet; cook and stir over medium-high heat until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer bacon to a paper towel-lined plate; set aside.
2. Sprinkle rabbit with salt and coat with flour, shaking off excess. Cook rabbit in bacon fat in the skillet over medium heat until browned. Transfer rabbit to a plate and set aside. Drain excess grease, leaving 2 tablespoons fat in the skillet.
3. Sauté shallots and garlic in fat in the skillet until tender, about 4 minutes. Add wine, water, and bouillon. Bring to a boil, then stir in jelly, peppercorns, bay leaf, and rosemary.
4. Return rabbit and bacon to the skillet. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Cover and let simmer until rabbit is tender, about 1 1/2 hours.
5. Remove bay leaf and discard. Place rabbit on a warm platter; cover to keep warm while preparing gravy.
6. Make gravy: Stir lemon juice into cooking liquid in the skillet. Mix together water and flour in a small bowl; stir mixture into the skillet over low heat and simmer until thickened. Stir in thyme.
7. Pour gravy over rabbit or serve in a gravy boat on the side.
