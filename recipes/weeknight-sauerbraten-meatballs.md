## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 1 pound lean ground beef
- ½ cup minced onion
- ⅓ cup gingersnap cookie crumbs
- ¼ cup water
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 2 cups beef broth
- ½ cup gingersnap cookie crumbs
- 2 tablespoons gingersnap cookie crumbs, or more as needed
- ½ cup apple cider vinegar
- 1 tablespoon white sugar, or more to taste
- 3 tablespoons raisins

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and place a baking rack on top. Spray the rack with cooking spray.
2. Combine ground beef, onion, gingersnap crumbs, water, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl. Shape into 24 meatballs using a tablespoon-sized cookie scoop. Place the meatballs on the prepared baking rack.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until a meat thermometer inserted into the center of a meatball reads 160 degrees F (71 degrees C), 18 to 20 minutes.
4. While the meatballs are baking, whisk beef broth, 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons gingersnap crumbs, vinegar, and sugar together in a medium saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until gravy thickens, 5 to 10 minutes. Add more gingersnap crumbs for a thicker gravy, or some water for a thinner consistency.
5. Stir cooked meatballs and raisins into the gravy. Cover and simmer until flavors combine, about 10 minutes.
