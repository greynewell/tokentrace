## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 8 large eggs
- 2 cups milk
- 3  green onions, chopped
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ¾ pound Canadian bacon, cut into 1/2-inch dice
- 6  English muffins, cut into 1/2-inch dice
- ½ teaspoon paprika
- 1 (.9 ounce) package hollandaise sauce mix
- 1 cup milk
- ¼ cup margarine

## Instructions

1. Spray 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
2. Whisk 2 cups milk, eggs, green onions, onion powder, and salt together in a large bowl until well combined.
3. Layer 1/2 of the Canadian bacon in the prepared baking dish, then layer English muffin pieces over top. Top with remaining Canadian bacon, then pour egg mixture over everything. Cover the baking dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.
4. When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
5. Remove casserole from the refrigerator and discard plastic wrap. Sprinkle casserole with paprika and cover with aluminum foil.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until eggs are nearly set, about 30 minutes. Remove the foil and continue baking until eggs are completely set, about 15 minutes longer.
7. When the casserole is almost finished, whisk remaining 1 cup milk and Hollandaise sauce mix together in a saucepan over medium heat. Add margarine and cook, stirring frequently, until boiling. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring constantly, until thickened, about 1 minute.
8. Slice casserole into 10 pieces. Drizzle Hollandaise sauce over each piece.
