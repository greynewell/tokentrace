## Ingredients

- 1  egg
- ¼ cup water
- 1 pound ground beef
- 2 slices bread, crumbled
- 1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 cup ketchup
- 1 cup beef bouillon
- ½ cup vinegar
- ½ cup brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Beat egg and water in a bowl; add ground beef, bread crumbs, salt, and black pepper to eggs and mix thoroughly. Form ground beef mixture into bite-size meatballs; place meatballs into a large baking dish.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until meatballs are browned and no longer pink inside, 25 to 30 minutes.
4. Mix ketchup, beef bouillon, and vinegar in a large saucepan or Dutch oven. Combine brown sugar and cornstarch in a small bowl and stir brown sugar mixture into ketchup mixture. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and stir until sauce is thickened and bubbling and brown sugar has dissolved, about 5 minutes. Add meatballs to sauce, stir until coated, and serve.
