## Ingredients

- 1 pound chicken wing sections (flats and drums)
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- ½ cup stone-ground rice flour
- 2 cups vegetable oil for frying, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Place split chicken wings into a mixing bowl.
2. Sprinkle with salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper.
3. Toss to evenly coat pieces.
4. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight.
5. Place rice flour in a shallow dish.
6. Dredge chicken wing pieces in small batches in the flour and transfer to a plate.
7. Arrange pieces so there is some space between them; allow wings to sit out for 15 minutes before frying.
8. Line a baking sheet with paper towels; place a draining rack on the towels.
9. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
10. Transfer wings to oil; fry until inside is crispy and golden brown and chicken is cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes.
11. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
12. Remove wings from oil with a slotted spoon and drain on a rack placed over paper towels.
