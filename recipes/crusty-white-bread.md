## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons active dry yeast
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 2 cups water
- 1 cup milk
- 2 tablespoons margarine, softened
- 6 cups bread flour
- 1 tablespoon salt

## Instructions

1. In a small mixing bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine yeast mixture with milk, margarine, 4 cups flour, and salt; stir until well combined. Add remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring well after each addition. When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and supple, about 8 minutes.
3. Lightly grease a large mixing bowl, place dough in the bowl and turn to coat. Cover with a damp cloth and put in a warm place to rise until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
4. Deflate dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide dough into two equal pieces and form each into a loaf. Place loaves into two lightly greased 9x5-inch loaf pans. Cover loaves with a damp cloth and let rise until doubled in volume, about 40 minutes.
5. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
6. Mist loaves with water and bake in the preheated oven for 20 to 30 minutes or until loaves are golden brown and the bottom of a loaf sounds hollow when tapped.
