## Ingredients

- 1 (9 ounce) package refrigerated cheese tortellini
- 2 tablespoons Butter
- 1 small onion, chopped
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
- ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- ½ cup milk
- fresh mushrooms, sliced
- 1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained

## Instructions

1. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Add tortellini and cook, stirring occasionally, until tortellini float to the top and the filling is hot, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain.

Mix in spinach, cream cheese, mushrooms, Parmesan, and milk; stir to combine and cook until cream cheese is melted and mushrooms are soft, about 5 minutes.
