## Ingredients

- 1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 1 cup brown sugar
- ⅓ cup white sugar
- 3 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon orange extract
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1 cup sweetened dried cranberries (such as Craisins®)
- ½ cup white chocolate chips
- ½ (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- ¼ cup unsalted butter, softened
- 3 cups confectioners' sugar
- 1 teaspoon orange extract
- ½ cup sweetened dried cranberries (such as Craisins®), chopped
- 1 tablespoon grated orange zest, or more to taste
- ⅓ cup white chocolate chips
- ½ teaspoon canola oil

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 9x13-inch baking dish with parchment paper.
2. Beat butter, brown sugar, and white sugar for bars together with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Stir in eggs, orange extract, and vanilla extract until well blended. Add flour, baking powder, and ginger; mix until well incorporated and the batter looks like soft cookie dough. Stir in cranberries and white chocolate chips until well mixed. Spread the stiff batter into the prepared pan.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until light brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Don't overbake, or your bars will be dry. Let cool completely, about 30 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, mix cream cheese and butter for frosting together until light and fluffy. Add confectioners' sugar and orange extract; beat mixture until fluffy and spreadable. Spread evenly over the cooled bars.
5. Combine cranberries and orange zest for topping in a food processor and roughly chop. Sprinkle evenly over the frosted bars.
6. Mix white chocolate chips and oil together in a glass, microwave-safe measuring cup. Microwave until fluid enough to drizzle, 1 minute to 1 minute 15 seconds, stirring every 15 seconds until melted. Use a fork or whisk to drizzle the melted chocolate diagonally across the bars.
7. Allow chocolate to set for at least 1 hour before cutting into squares or triangles.
