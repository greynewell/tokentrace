## Ingredients

- 3  russet potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks
- 3 tablespoons butter
- 1 pinch freshly grated nutmeg
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
- ½ cup milk
- 2 teaspoons olive oil
- 12 ounces baby spinach leaves
- 3 tablespoons butter
- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 cups cold milk, divided
- 2 teaspoons lemon zest
- 1 tablespoon butter
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
- 2 pounds boneless cod fillets
- ½  lemon, juiced
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives for garnish

## Instructions

1. Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil; add potatoes to boiling water and cook until very tender, about 20 minutes. Drain well. Mash in 3 tablespoons butter until thoroughly combined. Season with nutmeg, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Mash 1/2 cup milk into potato mixture until smooth.
2. Drizzle olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat, add spinach, and season with a big pinch of salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until spinach has wilted, about 1 minute. Transfer to a bowl lined with paper towels to wick away excess moisture.
3. Heat 3 tablespoons butter and flour in a saucepan over medium heat; whisk mixture to a smooth paste. Cook, stirring constantly, until mixture has a nutty smell and is slightly browned, about 2 minutes. Add garlic; whisk until fragrant, 10 to 20 seconds.
4. Whisk 1 cup cold milk into flour mixture; cook until thickened. Whisk in remaining 1 cup milk and lemon zest. Bring white sauce to a gentle simmer, whisking constantly; season with salt. Turn heat to very low and keep sauce warm.
5. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease an 8x12-inch casserole dish with 1 tablespoon butter.
6. Season buttered pan with salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Lay boneless cod fillets into the pan in a single layer. Season tops of fillets with more salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Spread spinach evenly over fish and drizzle with lemon juice. Spoon white sauce over spinach; give casserole dish several taps and shakes to eliminate bubbles.
7. Drop mashed potatoes by heaping spoonfuls over the casserole and spread smoothly to cover. Place dish onto a rimmed baking sheet to catch spills.
8. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling, about 40 minutes. Turn on the oven's broiler and broil until potato crust has a golden brown top, about 2 minutes. Fish should flake easily. Let stand 10 minutes before serving. Garnish with a sprinkle of chives.
