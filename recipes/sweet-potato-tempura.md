## Ingredients

- 2  eggs
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¾ cup ice water
- 3 tablespoons ice water
- ¾ cup all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
- 2 cups oil for frying
- 1  sweet potato, scrubbed and sliced into 1/8-inch slices
- ¼ cup rice wine
- ¼ cup soy sauce

## Instructions

1. Beat eggs in a large bowl until frothy. Stir in salt, 3/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons ice water, and 3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon flour until just incorporated but batter is still very lumpy.
2. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
3. Dry sweet potato slices well. Dip 3 slices at a time in the batter, letting excess batter drip back into the bowl. Fry until golden brown, turning once, about 2 minutes per side. Lift out with a slotted spoon onto a cooling rack set over paper towels. Repeat with remaining slices.
4. Whisk rice wine and soy sauce together in a small bowl to make dipping sauce.
