## Ingredients

- ¼ cup warm water (110 degrees F (43 degrees C))
- 1 (.25 ounce) package rapid-rise yeast
- ¾ cup warm milk (115 degrees F (46 degrees C))
- 1  egg
- ¼ cup orange marmalade
- 2 tablespoons butter, melted
- 3 cups bread flour
- ½ cup old-fashioned oats
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 ½ cups chopped fresh cranberries
- 6 tablespoons brown sugar
- 6 tablespoons water
- 6 tablespoons chopped walnuts
- 1 ½ tablespoons butter
- 1 ½ tablespoons lemon juice
- 1  egg white
- 1 teaspoon water
- ½ cup powdered sugar
- 1 teaspoon frozen orange juice concentrate
- 1 teaspoon water, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Combine warm water and yeast in a large bowl; stir to dissolve. Add warm milk, egg, marmalade, and butter. Stir to combine.
2. Mix flour, oats, and salt together in a separate bowl. Add to yeast mixture and stir until moistened. Knead dough until smooth and elastic, 6 to 8 minutes. Place dough in a greased bowl, turning to coat both sides. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, combine cranberries, brown sugar, and water in a small saucepan. Cook over medium heat until cranberries begin to soften, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in walnuts, butter, and lemon juice. Let cool.
4. Punch dough down. Roll dough into a 10x20-inch rectangle on a floured surface.
5. Whisk egg white and water together. Brush lightly over the dough. Spread cranberry filling over the dough, leaving a 1-inch border on all sides. Roll up tightly, starting from a long edge. Seal edges and cut off any tapered sides with no filling.
6. Transfer roll to a large square baking sheet. Join ends together to form a ring. Use sharp kitchen shears to make cuts at 1-inch intervals, cutting 2/3 of the way through the dough. Twist each slice gently to expose the swirled filling. Gently shape dough into a perfect ring. Cover and let rise until doubled, 20 to 25 minutes.
7. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
8. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 25 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 20 minutes before removing to a wire rack. Let cool completely.
9. Stir powdered sugar and orange juice concentrate together in a small bowl. Add enough water to reach a glaze-like consistency. Drizzle glaze over tea ring. Allow glaze to set before slicing.
