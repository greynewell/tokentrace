## Ingredients

- 1 cup brown sugar
- 1 cup white sugar
- ½ cup evaporated milk
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 ¼ cups pecan halves
- ¼ teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Generously grease a large slab or baking sheet.
2. In a saucepan over medium heat, combine brown sugar, white sugar and milk. Bring to a boil. Stir in butter, pecans and vanilla. Heat, without stirring, to between 234 and 240 degrees F (112 to 116 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a soft ball that flattens when removed from the water and placed on a flat surface. Remove from heat and let cool 5 minutes.
3. Beat until thickened, then pour immediately onto prepared surface and let rest until firm and completely cool before cutting.
