## Ingredients

- 2  potatoes
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 2  onion, chopped
- 3  spring onions, chopped
- 1  red bell pepper, chopped
- 1 pound ground beef
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- salt to taste
- ¾ cup green olives, pitted and chopped
- 2  hard-boiled eggs, chopped
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 24  empanada pastry rounds
- 1  egg, lightly beaten

## Instructions

1. Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until barely tender, about 8 minutes. Drain. Once cool enough to handle, peel and cut into cubes. Set aside.
2. Meanwhile, melt butter in a large skillet and cook onion and spring onions until softened, about 5 minutes. Add bell pepper and cook for 3 minutes. Add ground beef. Cook and stir until beef is browned, about 5 minutes. Season with paprika, cayenne pepper, and salt.
3. Remove beef mixture from heat, add potatoes and olives, and mix well. Stir in chopped hard-boiled eggs and set filling aside to cool, about 20 minutes.
4. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with aluminum foil and lightly grease with olive oil.
5. Place an empanada pastry round on a flat surface and lightly wet edges with warm water. Put a large tablespoon of cooled filling in the center and fold pastry over. Seal edges by pressing with a fork. Repeat with remaining rounds and filling. Transfer empanadas to the prepared baking sheets and brush with beaten egg.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until golden, 15 to 20 minutes.
