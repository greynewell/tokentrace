## Ingredients

- 1 (8 ounce) package refrigerated crescent rolls
- ¾ pound sliced ham
- 4 slices sharp white Cheddar cheese
- 3 tablespoons salted butter
- 1 ½ tablespoons brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Unroll crescent rolls into 4 rectangles and firmly close the seam between the triangles. Lay ham and Cheddar cheese evenly over 2 of the rectangles; lay remaining rectangles on top.
3. Combine butter, brown sugar, Dijon mustard, and Worcestershire sauce in a small saucepan over low heat. Simmer until sugar melts and begins to resemble a warm syrup consistency. Divide glaze between both sandwiches and spread all over the top.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until golden, 13 to 16 minutes. Let cool slightly, about 5 minutes; cut each rectangle into 4 triangles.
