- 1 (.25 ounce) package unflavored gelatin
- 3 teaspoons freshly squeezed lime juice
- ¾ teaspoon coconut extract
- ½ cup granulated sugar for coating

## Instructions

1. Spray an 8x8-inch baking dish with non-fat cooking spray. Place dish in refrigerator.
2. Combine granulated sugar, applesauce, pineapple-flavored gelatin, unflavored gelatin, lime juice, and coconut extract in saucepan.
