## Ingredients

- 1 (3 pound) boneless corned beef brisket
- 1 ½ cups yellow split peas
- 1 large head cabbage, quartered
- 1 medium turnip, peeled and cubed
- 6  carrots, peeled and cut in chunks
- 6 large potatoes, peeled and quartered
- 2 tablespoons butter
- ½ teaspoon black pepper
- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons white sugar
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- ¾ cup water

## Instructions

1. Cover corned beef with cold water and soak for 8 hours to overnight in the refrigerator.
2. Drain beef, place in a large Dutch oven, and cover with fresh water. Place peas in a triple layer of cheesecloth and tie securely. Place the bag inside the Dutch oven with beef. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook for 2 hours.
3. Add cabbage, turnip, and carrots to the pot. Simmer for 25 minutes.
4. Add potatoes and simmer until all vegetables are fork tender, 20 to 25 minutes.
5. While vegetables are cooking, prepare the dumpling dough: Combine flour, sugar, and baking powder in a bowl, then add just enough water to make a pasty dough. Divide the dough into 6 balls, taking care to not overwork the dough.
6. During the last 5 to 10 minutes of simmering vegetables, place dumplings on top of vegetables and cover with a lid. Allow dumplings to steam in the pot for 7 minutes.
7. When dumplings are cooked through, remove all ingredients from the pot and arrange on a warm serving platter. Remove cooked peas from the cheesecloth bag and mash with butter and pepper. Serve alongside the beef and vegetables.
