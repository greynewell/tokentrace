## Ingredients

- 1 cup uncooked long grain white rice
- 2 cups water
- 1 ½ tablespoons lemon pepper, divided
- 1 tablespoon dried dill weed, divided
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
- 1 pound salmon
- 1  tomato, sliced 1/2 inch thick
- 2  eggs, beaten
- 1 cup all-purpose flour

## Instructions

1. Bring the rice and water to a boil in a pot. Season with 1 tablespoon lemon pepper and 1/2 tablespoon dill weed. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 20 minutes.
2. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a skillet over medium heat. Place salmon in the skillet, and cook 20 minutes, turning once, until lightly browned and easily flaked with a fork. Set aside.
3. Season the tomato slices with remaining lemon pepper and dill. Place the eggs and flour in 2 separate dishes. Dip each tomato slice in the egg to coat, then press in the flour, coating both sides.
