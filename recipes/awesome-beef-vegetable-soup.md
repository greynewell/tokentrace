## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon butter
- ¼ cup chopped onion
- 1 clove garlic, chopped
- ½ teaspoon prepared horseradish
- 1 ½ pounds ground beef
- 2 (28 ounce) cans diced tomatoes, undrained
- 3 ½ cups water
- 5  potatoes, chopped
- 1 (10 ounce) package frozen mixed vegetables
- ½ cup chopped carrots
- 1 (10 ounce) package frozen corn
- 1 tablespoon butter-flavored granules (such as Butter Buds®)
- 1 teaspoon dill seasoning
- 1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce
- ¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- grated Parmesan cheese to taste
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat, and stir in the onion, garlic, and horseradish. Cook and stir until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes, then mix in the ground beef. Cook and stir the ground beef until evenly browned, no longer pink, and crumbly. Drain excess fat, and transfer the cooked beef mixture into a large soup pot.
2. Mix in the tomatoes, water, potatoes, mixed vegetables, carrots, corn, butter-flavored granules, dill seasoning, hot pepper sauce, and cinnamon, and stir to thoroughly combine. Bring the soup to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer and cook until the vegetables are tender, about 1 hour. Stir occasionally. Before serving, season to taste with Parmesan cheese, salt, and black pepper.
