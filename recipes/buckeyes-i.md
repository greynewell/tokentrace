## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups peanut butter
- 1 cup butter, softened
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- 6 cups confectioners' sugar
- 4 cups semisweet chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. Beat peanut butter, butter, and vanilla together in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in 4 cups sifted confectioners' sugar until dough is stiff, firm, and dry with no lumps; you may need up to 2 cups more sifted confectioners' sugar.
2. Roll dough into about sixty 1-inch balls and place on wax-lined cookie sheets. Press a toothpick into the top of each ball and chill in the freezer until firm, about 30 minutes.
3. Place chocolate chips in a double boiler or in a bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water. Stir frequently until melted and smooth.
4. Hold the toothpicks and dip frozen peanut butter balls into the melted chocolate, leaving a small portion of peanut butter showing at the top. Return to the cookie sheet, remove and discard the toothpicks, and refrigerate until ready to serve.
