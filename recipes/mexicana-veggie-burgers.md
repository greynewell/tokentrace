## Ingredients

- 1 cup white rice
- 2 cups water
- 1 (10 ounce) package frozen corn niblets
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed
- 1 (15 ounce) can chickpeas, drained and rinsed
- 1 clove garlic, minced, or more to taste
- ⅓ cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
- ⅓ cup all-purpose flour
- 1 pinch red pepper flakes, or to taste
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour, or more if needed
- ½ teaspoon Cajun seasoning, or to more taste
- 1 pinch red pepper flakes, or more to taste
- 1 tablespoon olive oil

## Instructions

1. Bring rice and water to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Stir corn into hot rice.
2. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir black beans, chickpeas, and garlic until warmed, 3 to 5 minutes.
3. Combine rice mixture and bean mixture in a large bowl. Stir Cheddar cheese, 1/3 cup flour, and a pinch of red pepper flakes into rice-bean mixture into a thick mixture; form into patties.
4. Mix about 1/4 cup flour, Cajun seasoning, and a pinch of red pepper flakes in a small bowl. Coat each patty in flour mixture.
5. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a skillet over medium heat; pan-fry patties until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side.
