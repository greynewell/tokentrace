## Ingredients

- 1 pound extra large shrimp (16-20), peeled and deveined, tail left on
- 2 tablespoons olive oil, or more as needed
- 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste
- 1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
- 1 pinch Aleppo pepper flakes, or to taste
- ½  yellow onion, sliced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- ½ teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 cup white wine
- 1 ½ cups canned crushed tomatoes (such as San Marzano)
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
- 2 tablespoons thinly sliced fresh basil leaves

## Instructions

1. Combine shrimp, olive oil, red pepper flakes, salt, and Aleppo pepper flakes in a bowl; toss to coat shrimp completely in oil and spices.
2. Heat a large skillet over high heat until very hot. Cook shrimp in a single layer in the hot skillet until the bottoms are browned, about 2 minutes. Turn shrimp and cook until browned on the other side, about 1 minute more. Transfer shrimp to a clean bowl.
3. Heat the same skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion with a pinch of salt in the hot skillet until onions are slightly golden and translucent, 2 to 4 minutes. Add garlic and oregano; cook and stir until fragrant, 15 to 30 seconds.
4. Pour white wine into onions; bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Add crushed tomatoes and lower heat to medium-low. Cook and stir until tomato mixture thickens and flavors blend, 10 to 15 minutes.
5. Return shrimp to the skillet along with any accumulated juices in the bowl. Cook until shrimp are reheated, 2 to 4 minutes. Stir parsley and basil into sauce; season with salt, red pepper flakes, and Aleppo pepper flakes.
