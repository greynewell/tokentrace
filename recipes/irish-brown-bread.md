## Ingredients

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 ½ tablespoons butter
- 2 cups whole wheat flour
- ¼ cup quick-cooking oatmeal
- 1 ½ cups nonfat plain yogurt
- 1 teaspoon milk, or more as needed  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Lightly grease a baking sheet.
3. Mix all-purpose flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl.
4. Cut butter into flour mixture with a pastry blender or 2 knives until the mixture forms fine crumbs.
5. Stir whole-wheat flour and quick-cooking oatmeal into the butter mixture.
6. Gently stir yogurt into the oatmeal mixture. If mixture is too dry to hold together, add 1 teaspoon milk at a time, just until dough holds together; it should not be sticky.
7. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface; knead gently about 5 times to form a ball.
8. Place the dough in the center of the prepared baking sheet; cut a large 'X' in the top of the loaf.
9. Bake in preheated oven until well browned, about 40 minutes; transfer to a rack to cool. Bread can be served warm or cold.
