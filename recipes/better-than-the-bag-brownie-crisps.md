## Ingredients

- nonstick cooking spray
- ⅓ cup butter
- 2 (1 ounce) squares 65% dark chocolate, chopped
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ½ teaspoon instant espresso powder
- ½ cup unbleached all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon baking soda
- 2  egg whites
- ½ cup mini chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and lightly grease with nonstick spray.
2. Place butter and chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat in 30-second intervals until melted, stirring between each interval. Stir sugar, vanilla extract, and espresso into the melted chocolate. Set aside.
3. Whisk flour, cocoa powder, salt, and baking soda together.
4. Beat egg whites with an electric mixer until frothy, 3 to 4 minutes. Pour in chocolate mixture and beat until combined. Mix in the flour mixture until a thick batter forms.
5. Spread batter onto the prepared baking sheet. Cover with plastic wrap. Place another baking sheet on top and smash it flat to ensure the batter is as thin as possible. Peel off plastic wrap and sprinkle chocolate chips over the batter.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until crisp, about 25 minutes. Allow to cool on the baking sheet before breaking up into pieces.
