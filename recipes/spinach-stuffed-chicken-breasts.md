## Ingredients

- ½ cup mayonnaise
- 1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained
- ½ cup crumbled feta cheese
- 2 cloves garlic, chopped
- 4  skinless, boneless chicken breasts
- 4 slices bacon

2. In a medium bowl, mix mayonnaise, spinach, feta cheese, and garlic until well blended. Set aside.
3. Carefully butterfly chicken breasts, making sure not to cut all the way through. Spoon spinach mixture into chicken breasts. Wrap each with a piece of bacon, and secure with a toothpick. Place in shallow baking dish. Cover.
