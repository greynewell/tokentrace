## Ingredients

- ½ cup milk
- ⅓ cup all-purpose flour
- 4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, pounded to an even thickness
- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 2 cups thinly sliced mushrooms
- 2 tablespoons dry white wine  (Optional)
- 1 ½ cups prepared chicken gravy
- 1 cup half-and-half
- 1 ½ tablespoons Dijon mustard
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Pour milk into a wide, shallow bowl. Spread flour into a separate wide, shallow bowl. Dip each chicken breast half into milk to coat; move to the dish with the flour and press chicken into flour to coat entirely.
2. Heat oil in skillet over medium-high heat. Fry chicken in hot oil until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Remove chicken to a plate; drain fat from the skillet and return to medium-high heat.
3. Melt butter in the skillet. Saute mushrooms in hot butter until softened, about 2 minutes. Pour white wine over the mushrooms. Stir gravy, half-and-half, and mustard with the mushrooms; season with salt and pepper. Bring the liquid to a simmer and cook for 2 minutes.
4. Return chicken to the skillet and cook until the chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 5 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
