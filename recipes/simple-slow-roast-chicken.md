## Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon garlic salt
- 1 teaspoon dried parsley
- 1 teaspoon dried marjoram
- 1 cup red wine
- 4 stalks celery, cut in half
- 1  onion, quartered
- 1 (4 pound) whole chicken

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Pour red wine into a roasting pan with a lid; set aside.
2. Combine paprika, black pepper, garlic salt, parsley, and marjoram in a small bowl. Rub chicken all over with spice mixture. Place celery and onion into the cavity of chicken; place chicken into the prepared roasting pan.
3. Cover and bake chicken in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and juices run clear, 4 to 5 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
4. Remove chicken from the roasting pan, cover with a doubled sheet of aluminum foil, and allow to rest in a warm area for 10 minutes before serving.
