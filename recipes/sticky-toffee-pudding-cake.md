## Ingredients

- 1 ¾ cups pitted, chopped dates
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ¾ cup boiling water
- ⅓ cup butter
- ¾ cup white sugar
- 2  eggs, beaten
- 1 ⅛ cups self-rising flour
- ¾ cup packed brown sugar

- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking dish.

4. Add the flour and date mixture (including water) to the egg mixture and fold to combine. Pour the batter into the prepared baking dish.

6. To Make Caramel Sauce: In a small saucepan combine the brown sugar, 1/3 cup butter, and evaporated milk. Cook over medium heat and bring to boil. Turn heat down and simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla. Pour the sauce over individual servings of warm cake.
