## Ingredients

- 3 ½ pounds Concord grapes
- ½ cup water
- 7 cups white sugar
- ½ (6 fluid ounce) container liquid pectin

## Instructions

1. Sort and wash grapes; discard stems. Place grapes into a large kettle and crush them. Add water, cover, and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from heat; pour juice into a strainer over a large bowl to extract juice. Allow juice to stand in a cool place 8 hours to overnight to prevent the formation of crystals in the jelly.
2. Strain juice through a double layer of damp cheesecloth.
3. Measure 4 cups juice into a large pot; stir in sugar and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in pectin and allow to boil for 1 minute. Remove from heat and skim off any foam on the surface.
4. Transfer jelly into hot sterile jars and top with sterile lids; process for 5 minutes in a boiling water bath.
