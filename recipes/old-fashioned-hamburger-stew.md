## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 pound ground beef
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 2 large russet potatoes, peeled and diced into 1/4-inch pieces
- 1 (15 ounce) can tomato puree
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can fire-roasted diced tomatoes
- 13 ½ cups water , divided
- 3 tablespoons Italian seasoning
- 2 tablespoons beef bouillon granules
- 2 tablespoons cooking sherry
- 2 teaspoons minced garlic
- 2 teaspoons Sriracha sauce
- 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 1 teaspoon dried rosemary
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 large bay leaves
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add ground beef and onion; cook until beef is browned and onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add potatoes, tomato puree, diced tomatoes, 12 cups water, Italian seasoning, beef bouillon, cooking sherry, garlic, Sriracha, Worcestershire sauce, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, red pepper flakes, rosemary, salt, and bay leaves to the pot. Bring to a boil.
2. Mix flour into remaining 1 1/2 cups of water until a thin slurry is formed. While stirring constantly, pour flour mixture into the boiling soup and stir to combine. Boil and stir until soup begins to thicken, about 3 minutes.
3. Reduce temperature to a simmer and stir in frozen vegetables. Continue to simmer, stirring occasionally, until potatoes and vegetables have cooked through, at least 20 minutes.
