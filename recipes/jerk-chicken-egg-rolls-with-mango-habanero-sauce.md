## Ingredients

- 1  mango, peeled and diced
- ¾ cup water
- 1 tablespoon seasoned rice vinegar
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 pinch salt
- ½ cup brown sugar, divided
- 2  habanero peppers, seeded and minced
- 2 tablespoons water
- 1 teaspoon cornstarch
- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided, or as needed
- 6  chicken thighs, diced
- 1 tablespoon jerk seasoning, or more to taste
- 1  shallot, finely chopped
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 head green cabbage, shredded
- 1 (12 ounce) package shredded carrots
- 2  very ripe yellow plantains, peeled and diced
- 1 (16 ounce) package egg roll wrappers
- 1  egg
- 1 tablespoon water
- vegetable oil for frying

## Instructions

1. For the habanero sauce: Combine mango with 3/4 cup water, rice vinegar, garlic, and salt in a small saucepan. Add most of the brown sugar, reserving 1 teaspoon. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low; cook for 5 minutes. Add habanero peppers and simmer for 2 minutes. Mix 2 tablespoon water with cornstarch; stir slurry into the saucepan. Cook over medium-high until thick, 3 to 5 minutes. Leave mixture chunky or blend for a smoother texture.
2. For the filling: Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add chicken thighs and sauté until browned, 5 to 7 minutes; sprinkle jerk seasoning over chicken. Add shallot and garlic; cook and stir until shallot begins to soften, about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium; add cabbage, carrots, and reserved sugar. Cook until cabbage is translucent but still a little crunchy, 3 to 5 minutes. Taste for seasoning. Let mixture cool.
3. Heat remaining vegetable oil in a pan over medium-high heat. Fry plantains until they start to brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer plantains onto a paper towel and let cool.
4. Separate and place egg roll wrappers onto your work surface. Mix egg with water for egg wash.
5. Lay out one wrapper with a corner pointed toward you. Use a slotted spoon to add some of the chicken and cabbage mixtures across the center. Sprinkle plantain bits on top. Use your finger or a pastry brush to lightly moisten edges of wonton wrappers with egg wash. Fold one corner of the wrapper over filling onto the opposite corner to form a triangle. Press edges together to seal. Fill and fold remaining egg rolls.
6. Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Fry egg rolls in batches in hot oil, turning occasionally, until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Remove and drain on paper towels or a rack. Serve with mango-habanero sauce.
