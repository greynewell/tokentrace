## Ingredients

- 1 gallon whole milk
- ¼ cup white or cider vinegar
- 1 pinch salt

## Instructions

1. Heat milk in a large pot until the temperature reaches 195 degrees F (90 degrees C), stirring constantly to prevent scorching on the bottom. Remove from the heat and stir in vinegar. Let stand for 10 minutes.
2. Line a mesh strainer with cheesecloth and set over a large bowl. Stir salt into milk; pour through the prepared strainer. Let curds strain for 1 hour. The milk should separate into a white solid part and a yellowish liquid (whey). Discard the whey.
3. Pat cheese into a ball and remove the cheesecloth. Wrap in plastic and store in the refrigerator until ready to use. Fresh cheese will usually last about 1 week.
