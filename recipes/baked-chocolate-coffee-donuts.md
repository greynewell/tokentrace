## Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon unsalted butter
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- ¼ cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ½ cup packed brown sugar
- ¼ cup buttermilk
- 2 tablespoons buttermilk
- ¼ cup strong brewed coffee
- 1  egg
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- ¼ cup chocolate chips, or to taste  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 6-cavity donut pan with 1 teaspoon butter and set aside.
2. Whisk flour, cocoa powder, and baking powder together in a large bowl. Set aside.
3. Whisk brown sugar, 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons buttermilk, coffee, egg, 1 tablespoon butter, and vanilla extract together in another bowl. Add milk mixture to flour mixture; whisk until blended and smooth. Stir in chocolate chips.
4. Pour batter into a large, resealable plastic bag, cut 1 corner, and squeeze batter into the prepared donut pan, filling each mold about 2/3 full.
