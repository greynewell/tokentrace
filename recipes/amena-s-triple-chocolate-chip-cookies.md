## Ingredients

- ½ cup unsalted butter
- ½ cup white sugar
- ¼ cup packed light brown sugar
- 1  large egg
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 ⅛ cups all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ⅓ cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
- ⅓ cup white chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicon mat or parchment paper.
2. Mash the butter, white sugar, and brown sugar together in a large mixing bowl with a spatula until creamy and smooth, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the egg and vanilla; whisk vigorously for 20 to 30 seconds.
