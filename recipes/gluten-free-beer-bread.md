## Ingredients

- 2 ¾ cups gluten-free flour blend
- ¼ cup buckwheat flour
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 2 ½ teaspoons xanthan gum
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 3  eggs at room temperature
- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 2 tablespoons agave nectar
- 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar
- 1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle gluten-free beer, at room temperature
- 2 ¼ teaspoons rapid-rise yeast

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
