## Ingredients

- 3 slices bacon
- ¾ cup butter
- 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard (such as Grey Poupon Country Mustard™)
- 1 ½ teaspoons chili powder
- ¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
- ¼ teaspoon dried basil
- ¼ teaspoon dried thyme
- 2 tablespoons chopped onion
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- ½ cup dry white wine
