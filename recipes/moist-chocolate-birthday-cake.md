## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- ¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 ¼ teaspoons baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 1 ¼ cups packed dark brown sugar
- ¾ cup white sugar
- 4 large eggs, separated
- 2 ounces unsweetened chocolate, melted
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- ½ cup buttermilk
- 1 cup hot coffee

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line three 8-inch cake pans with parchment paper. Grease the pans and dust with cocoa powder.
2. Sift together flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl. Set aside.
3. Beat butter, dark brown sugar, and white sugar together in a bowl using an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add egg yolks one at a time, scraping down the bowl after each addition. Beat on medium-high until fluffy.
4. Pour melted chocolate and vanilla extract into the bowl with the sugar mixture; mix on low speed until combined. Alternate adding flour mixture and buttermilk, beginning and ending with flour mixture, mixing on low speed. Pour in coffee slowly in a steady stream; mix on low speed until smooth.
5. Use an electric mixer to beat egg whites in a separate bowl until stiff peaks form. Fold gently into batter. Divide batter evenly between the 3 prepared cake pans.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes, making sure not to overbake. Let cool in pans for 10 minutes; turn out onto waxed paper to cool completely before frosting.
