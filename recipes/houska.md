## Ingredients

- 1 cup milk
- ¾ cup butter
- 1 ½ (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
- ¼ cup warm water (110 degrees F)
- 2  eggs
- 1  egg, separated
- 6 cups bread flour
- ¾ cup white sugar
- 2 teaspoons lemon zest
- ¼ teaspoon ground mace
- ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg

## Instructions

1. Heat the milk in a small saucepan until it bubbles, then remove from heat.
2. Stir in the butter until melted; let cool to lukewarm.
3. In a small mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water.
4. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.
5. In another small bowl, combine 2 whole eggs with the egg yolk; beat lightly.
6. In a large mixing bowl, mix together 4 cups flour, white sugar, salt, lemon zest, mace and nutmeg.
7. Make a well in the center of this mixture and pour in the cooled milk, yeast mixture and beaten eggs.
8. Beat well until a loose dough forms.
9. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 3 hours.
10. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface.
11. Gently knead the dough and gradually incorporate the remaining cup of flour.
12. Continue kneading until the dough is smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes.
13. Divide dough into 3 portions; 1 small, 1 medium and 1 large (or one the size of a tangerine, one the size of an orange and one the size of a grapefruit).
14. Cut the largest piece of dough in half and roll it out into 2 long ropes about 30 inches long.
15. Twist the ropes together and place into a 8 inch diameter spiral and place it on a lightly greased cookie sheet.
16. Cut the medium size piece of dough in half and roll out into 2 ropes about 20 inches long each.
17. Twist the ropes together and place in a ring on top of the first circle of dough.
18. Roll the smallest piece of dough into a rope about 12 inches long.
19. Coil this rope on top of the other dough.
20. The completed loaf should look like a pyramid.
21. Place the uncovered loaf in an unheated oven to rise until doubled in size, about 2 hours.
22. Remove the loaf from oven and preheat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
23. Lightly beat the reserved egg white and brush over the loaf.
24. Bake at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for 30 to 40 minutes or until lightly browned.
25. If bread starts to brown too quickly, cover with aluminum foil and continue baking.
26. Cool on wire rack.
