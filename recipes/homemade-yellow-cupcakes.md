## Ingredients

- ¾ cup unbleached all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons unbleached all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ⅔ cup white sugar
- ½ cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 2 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ⅓ cup milk

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners.
2. Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl until well blended.
3. Combine sugar and butter in a medium bowl with an electric mixer until fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add eggs and vanilla extract; beat until combined, about 2 minutes. Pour into the flour mixture and beat, while adding milk, until just blended. Don't overmix. Fill the prepared muffin cups with batter, 2/3 to 3/4 full.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool in the tin for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
