## Ingredients

- 2 cups whole almonds
- ¼ cup white sugar
- ½ teaspoon kosher salt
- 3 tablespoons honey
- 3 tablespoons water
- 1 tablespoon almond oil

## Instructions

1. Spread almonds in a single layer on a baking sheet and place in a cold oven.
2. Turn the oven on to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake almonds, stirring occasionally, until light tan and fragrant, 12 to 15 minutes. The nuts will continue to cook after removing them from the oven.
3. Meanwhile, mix sugar and salt together in a small bowl; sprinkle 1 tablespoon sugar mixture into a large bowl.
4. Stir honey, water, and almond oil together in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Add almonds; cook and stir until almonds have absorbed all the liquid, about 5 minutes.
5. Transfer coated almonds to the large bowl sprinkled with sugar mixture. Sprinkle remaining sugar mixture over almonds; toss to coat evenly.
6. Spread almonds onto waxed paper to cool completely. Store at room temperature in a tightly covered container or resealable plastic bag.
