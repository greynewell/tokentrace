## Ingredients

- 1 head garlic
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 ⅓ cups dark brown sugar
- 1 cup pineapple juice
- ⅔ cup water
- ¼ cup teriyaki sauce
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 3 tablespoons lemon juice
- 3 tablespoons minced white onion
- 1 tablespoon bourbon whiskey
- 1 tablespoon crushed pineapple
- ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
2. Cut about 1/2-inch off top of garlic head. Trim root, so garlic sits flat. Remove outer layers of papery skin, leaving enough so cloves remain intact. Place garlic into a small baking dish, drizzle olive oil on top, and cover with a lid or aluminum foil.
3. Roast garlic in the preheated oven until cloves are soft and fragrant, about 1 hour.
4. Stir brown sugar, pineapple juice, water, teriyaki sauce, and soy sauce together in a saucepan and bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and keep at a simmer.
5. Squeeze sides of garlic until pasty roasted garlic emerges. Measure 2 teaspoons roasted garlic into the saucepan and whisk until incorporated. Reserve remaining roasted garlic for another use.
6. Stir lemon juice, onion, bourbon whiskey, pineapple, and cayenne pepper into sauce. Bring to a simmer and cook until liquid reduces by half and turns thick and syrup-like, 40 to 50 minutes.
