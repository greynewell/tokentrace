## Ingredients

- 2 cups flour
- 1 ½ teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 4  very ripe bananas
- 2  eggs
- 1 cup sugar
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon nutmeg
- ¼ teaspoon ground cloves
- ½ cup melted butter
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 8x3 inch loaf pans. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, and baking soda; set aside.
2. Mash the bananas, eggs, sugar, cinnamon, salt, nutmeg, and cloves together in a large bowl with a fork until well combined. Stir in the melted butter and vanilla extract, then fold in the flour mixture until a batter forms and no dry lumps remain. Pour into the prepared loaf pans.
