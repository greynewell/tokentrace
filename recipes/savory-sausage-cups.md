## Ingredients

- 1 (16 ounce) package Jimmy Dean® Premium Pork Regular Sausage
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- 4 ounces garden vegetable cream cheese, softened
- 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
- ¼ cup finely chopped red bell pepper
- ¼ cup finely chopped green onion
- 2 (8 ounce) packages crescent roll sheets

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Add sausage to a frying pan over medium-high heat. Cook and stir with a spatula, breaking apart the sausage until cooked, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and let cool.
3. Combine regular and vegetable cream cheese, Cheddar cheese, bell pepper, green onion, and cooled, crumbled sausage in a bowl. Mix well and set aside.
4. Unroll 1 crescent dough sheet and press into a 9x12-inch rectangle. Cut 6 rows across and 4 rows vertically to yield 24 squares. Repeat with the second package of dough.
5. Place 1 square in each cup of two nonstick 24-cup mini muffin tins, pressing it into the bottom and up the sides.
6. Drop 1 heaping teaspoon of sausage filling into each cup. Filling should be up to the top of the cup, but you do not need to press it down.
7. Bake in the preheated oven until the dough is golden brown, 11 to 13 minutes.
8. Cool for 5 minutes in the tins before removing to a platter.
