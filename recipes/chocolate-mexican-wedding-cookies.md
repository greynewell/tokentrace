## Ingredients

- 1 cup butter, softened
- ⅓ cup confectioners' sugar
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 cup ground pecans
- ½ cup German sweet chocolate, grated
- ¾ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 pinch salt
- ½ cup confectioners' sugar
- ¼ cup German sweet chocolate, grated

## Instructions

1. In a large bowl, cream the butter and 1/3 cup confectioner's sugar until light and fluffy. Add the vanilla extract.
2. In a separate bowl, combine the flour, ground pecans, 1/2 cup ground chocolate, cinnamon and salt; mix well.
3. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the creamed mixture.
4. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and chill 1 to 2 hours, or until firm.
5. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (180 degrees C).
