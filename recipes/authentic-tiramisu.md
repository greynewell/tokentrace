## Ingredients

- ½ cup white sugar
- 3  eggs, separated
- 2 tablespoons brandy
- 2 cups brewed espresso, cooled, divided
- 2 (8 ounce) packages mascarpone cheese
- 1 pinch white sugar
- 30  ladyfingers (such as Savoiardi®)
- 3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder

## Instructions

1. Beat together egg yolks, 1/2 cup sugar, brandy, and 1 tablespoon espresso in a bowl with an electric mixer until smooth, 2 to 3 minutes. Add mascarpone cheese; beat until well blended, 3 to 5 minutes.
2. Beat egg whites and a pinch of sugar in a separate, clean bowl with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form. Gently fold egg whites into mascarpone mixture; set aside.
3. Pour remaining espresso into a shallow dish. Dip 1 side of each ladyfinger into espresso and arrange on a serving platter in 2 horizontal rows of 6 and 2 1/2 ladyfingers in opposite directions on both ends to form a rectangular shape.
4. Spread 1/2 of the mascarpone mixture onto ladyfingers and dust with 1/2 of the cocoa powder. Top with remaining ladyfingers dipped in espresso, mascarpone mixture, and cocoa powder.
5. Refrigerate tiramisu until ladyfingers have softened, 2 to 3 hours.
