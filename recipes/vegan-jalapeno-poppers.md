## Ingredients

- 12 medium jalapeno peppers, sliced in half and seeded
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1 (8 ounce) package button mushrooms, finely diced
- ½ cup finely diced onion
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 (8 ounce) tub vegan cream cheese substitute, softened
- 1 cup vegan shredded cheese substitute, divided
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Set jalapeño halves on a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil, open side up.
2. Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms, onion, and garlic to the skillet and saute until vegetables are tender and mushrooms have released their liquid, about 8 minutes. Transfer vegetables to a paper towel-lined plate to soak up the excess moisture.
3. Mix mushroom mixture, cream cheese substitute, 3/4 cup shredded cheese substitute, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Spoon into the jalapeño pepper halves on the baking sheet.
4. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes.
5. Remove from the oven and top with the remaining 1/4 shredded cheese substitute. Broil until the cheese is melted and slightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes.
