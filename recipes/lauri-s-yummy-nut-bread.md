## Ingredients

- 2 cups white sugar
- 2  eggs
- 2 tablespoons cooking oil
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 4 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 9x5 inch loaf pas.
2. In a large bowl, stir together the sugar, eggs, vegetable oil and vanilla until smooth using a wooden spoon. Combine the flour, baking soda, salt and cinnamon; stir into the sugar mixture alternately with the buttermilk just until mixed. Stir in the walnuts. Divide the batter evenly between the two pans.
