## Ingredients

- ¾ cup white sugar
- ½ cup unsalted butter, softened
- 1 large egg
- 1 teaspoon coconut flavoring
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ⅔ cup coconut milk
- 1 ½ cups cake flour (not self-rising)
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 12 (1 ounce) squares good quality white chocolate
- 2 tablespoons sweetened shredded coconut, toasted  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter and flour a 9-inch round cake pan.
2. Cream sugar and butter together in a large mixing bowl until light and fluffy; scrape down the sides of the bowl. Add egg, coconut flavoring, baking powder, and salt; beat for 1 minute and scrape the bowl. Beat in coconut milk until combined. Stir in flour until combined. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, then beat for 3 minutes.
3. Pour batter into the prepared pan and spread until smooth. Drop the pan from 2 inches above the counter a few times to eliminate any large air pockets.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until the sides of the cake pull away from the pan and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Run a table knife around the edges to loosen. Invert carefully onto a serving plate or cooling rack. Let cool completely, 30 minutes or longer.
5. Meanwhile, bring cream to a full boil, watching carefully to prevent scorching. Remove pan from the heat and add white chocolate; stir until chocolate melts and mixture is smooth. Place in the refrigerator until thoroughly chilled, about 30 minutes.
6. Remove chocolate mixture from the refrigerator and beat with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Frost the cooled cake and sprinkle with toasted coconut.
