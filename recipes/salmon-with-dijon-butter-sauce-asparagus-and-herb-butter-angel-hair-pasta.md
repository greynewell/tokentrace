## Ingredients

- ½ pound asparagus spears, trimmed and bottom thirds thinly peeled
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter
- ¼ cup chopped pecans
- 2 (4 ounce) fillets salmon
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- ½  lemon, halved (juice only)
- ⅓ (8 ounce) package angel hair pasta
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 tablespoon minced parsley
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- ½  lemon, halved (juice only)

## Instructions

1. Place asparagus spears into a large skillet. Pour enough water to cover the bottom of the skillet about 1/2 inch deep; bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until water has evaporated, about 5 minutes.
2. Stir butter and pecans into the skillet with asparagus. Simmer until asparagus begin to brown and pecans are fragrant, about 2 more minutes. Remove from heat.
3. Season salmon fillets with salt and black pepper and set aside for about 5 minutes; pat off any excess moisture with paper towels.
4. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Pan-fry salmon fillets in hot oil until browned, flesh flakes easily, and the center of fillets are nearly opaque, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Squeeze 1/2 of a lemon over fillets as they cook.
5. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a boil; stir in angel hair pasta and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but still slightly firm, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain well and return to the pot.
6. Stir 2 tablespoons butter, parsley, and basil into cooked pasta until coated; sprinkle with salt and black pepper.
7. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a small saucepan over low heat until melted; stir in Dijon mustard and squeeze remaining lemon half into sauce. Simmer until flavors blend, about 3 minutes.
8. Divide angel hair pasta between 2 plates and top each with asparagus and pecans. Place fillets over asparagus. Spoon Dijon dressing over fillets to serve.
