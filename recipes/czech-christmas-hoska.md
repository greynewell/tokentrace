## Ingredients

- 1 (0.6 ounce) cake compressed fresh yeast
- ¼ cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
- ½ cup white sugar
- ½ cup butter
- 1  egg, beaten
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 cups scalded milk
- 6 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 pinch ground ginger
- 1 pinch ground mace
- ¼ teaspoon orange zest
- ½ cup golden raisins
- ½ cup candied mixed fruit peel
- ½ cup blanched slivered almonds
- 1  egg yolk
- 1 tablespoon milk
- 2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar

## Instructions

1. Make the sponge: Dissolve yeast in warm water.
2. Cream sugar and butter with an electric mixer in a large bowl. Add beaten egg and salt. Stir in cooled milk, then yeast mixture. Sift in flour and beat until smooth. Cover and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
3. Make the dough: Stir orange zest, ginger, and mace into sponge. Add flour and mix until a soft dough forms. Transfer dough to a lightly floured board and knead until smooth and elastic. Knead in raisins and candied peel. Place dough into a well-oiled bowl and turn once to coat the surface. Cover and let rise until doubled in size, about 2 hours.
4. Divide dough into 10 parts. Roll dough into ropes of desired length (make sure they are equal); let rise for 15 minutes.
5. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Generously grease a baking sheet.
6. Place 3 ropes dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Starting at the center and working toward each end, loosely braid ropes; pinch ends together to seal. Twist 2 more ropes together and place on the base of the braid. Repeat this process to form a second loaf with remaining dough.
7. Whisk egg yolk and milk together in a small bowl. Brush egg wash over each loaf and sprinkle with almonds. Let rise for about 45 minutes.
8. Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and transfer loaves to a wire rack. Cover with a tea towel to make a soft crust; let cool completely.
9. Sprinkle cooled loaves with confectioners' sugar.
