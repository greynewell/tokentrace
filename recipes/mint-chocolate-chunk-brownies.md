## Ingredients

- ¾ cup unsifted all-purpose flour
- ¼ teaspoon baking soda
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¾ cup white sugar
- ⅓ cup unsalted butter
- 2 tablespoons water
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon mint extract
- 2 large eggs
- 12 (1 ounce) squares semisweet chocolate, cut into 1/2-inch chunks

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch square baking pan.
2. Combine flour, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl.
3. Combine sugar, butter, and water in a pot over medium heat; bring to a boil. Immediately remove from the heat and add 1/2 of the semisweet chocolate, vanilla extract, and mint extract. Stir until smooth and chocolate has melted. Transfer to a large bowl and allow to cool for 10 minutes.
4. Add eggs, 1 at a time, to the chocolate mixture, beating well after each addition. Gradually add flour mixture and mix until smooth. Fold in remaining chocolate. Spread batter into the prepared baking pan.
