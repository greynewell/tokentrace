## Ingredients

- 2 cups bread flour
- 1 tablespoon superfine sugar
- 2 teaspoons superfine sugar
- 1 tablespoon green tea powder (matcha)
- 1 teaspoon instant yeast
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- ½ cup milk
- 2 tablespoons milk
- 1 large egg, lightly beaten
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
- 2 teaspoons unsalted butter

## Instructions

1. Place flour, 1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons sugar, green tea powder, yeast, and salt in a mixing bowl and mix by hand. Make a well in the center and pour in 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons milk and beaten egg. Mix to form a soft dough.
2. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Knead until dough becomes smooth and is no longer sticky, about 5 minutes. Knead and mix 1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons butter into the dough.
3. Continue to knead until dough is smooth and elastic and no longer sticks to the work surface, about 15 minutes. Smooth dough into a ball and place in a mixing bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let dough rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
4. Lightly grease a loaf pan. Remove dough from the bowl and punch out accumulated air. Place on a lightly floured surface and use a rolling pin to roll dough into a large rectangle slightly wider than the length of the loaf pan and as long as possible. Roll dough tightly, Swiss-roll style. Pinch dough to seal the seam tightly. Place seam-side down in the prepared pan and cover with plastic wrap. Let dough rise a second time until it fills 80% of the pan, 45 to 60 minutes.
5. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
6. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes.
7. Remove bread from pan immediately and let cool completely before slicing, about 30 minutes.
