## Ingredients

- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- 1 pound deli sliced corned beef or pastrami, cut into 1-inch pieces
- 1 cup sauerkraut, drained well, squeezed very dry
- ¼ cup sweet pickle relish
- 2 tablespoons mayonnaise
- 2 tablespoons sour cream
- 1 tablespoon ketchup
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
- 4 ounces shredded Gruyere cheese
- 4 ounces shredded Emmenthaler cheese
- Crackers and bread for serving

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Place cream cheese in a large bowl; add chopped meat and sauerkraut, sweet pickle relish, mayonnaise, sour cream, ketchup, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and shredded cheese. Mix thoroughly with a wooden spoon until well blended, 2 to 3 minutes.
3. Transfer mixture to an ovenproof baking dish. Distribute evenly and smooth out the top. To increase the surface exposure, add texture, and encourage browning, roughen up the surface a bit with the tines of a fork.
4. Bake in preheated oven until bubbling and browned, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool slightly before serving, about 15 minutes.
