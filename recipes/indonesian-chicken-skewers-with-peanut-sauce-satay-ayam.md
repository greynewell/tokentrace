## Ingredients

- 1 pound chicken thighs, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- 1 pinch ground white pepper
- 1 tablespoon sunflower seed oil
- 24  wooden skewers
- 1 cup water
- 5 tablespoons peanut butter
- 2 tablespoons kecap manis (sweet soy sauce)
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- 2 cloves garlic, minced

- 1 tablespoon lime juice

## Instructions

1. Combine chicken thighs, 3/4 teaspoon salt, white pepper, and sunflower seed oil in a bowl. Cover and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours.

4. Thread marinated chicken onto skewers; brush 2 tablespoons of peanut sauce over chicken skewers.
