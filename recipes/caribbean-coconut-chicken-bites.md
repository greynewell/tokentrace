3. Place 2 slices mango in the center of each prosciutto slice.
4. Roll the chicken breast lengthwise to completely enclose the mango and prosciutto.

16. Cover and refrigerate to allow coating to set, 15 minutes.
17. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
18. Heat enough vegetable oil in a deep, heavy skillet to immerse chicken rolls.
19. Turn heat to medium.
