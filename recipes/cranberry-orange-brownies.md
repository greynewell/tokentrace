## Ingredients

- ¾ cup miniature semisweet chocolate chips
- ½ cup bittersweet chocolate chips
- ½ cup unsalted butter
- 3 large eggs
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 tablespoon orange blossom water
- 2 teaspoons grated orange zest
- 1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste
- 1 ¼ cups sifted all-purpose flour
- ¼ teaspoon baking soda
- 1 pinch kosher salt
- 1 ½ cups chopped fresh cranberries
- sea salt to taste (optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line an 8x8-inch baking pan with parchment paper or grease with butter or shortening.
2. Place 1/2 cup mini semisweet chocolate chips in a large saucepan. Add bittersweet chips and butter and melt over low heat.
3. Remove from the heat. Whisk in eggs until thoroughly combined and the chocolate is smooth. Stir in sugar, orange blossom water, orange zest, and vanilla paste. Stir in flour, baking soda, and kosher salt until just combined. Fold in cranberries and remaining 1/4 cup semisweet chips.
4. Pour and spread the batter evenly into the prepared pan.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out mostly clean, 40 to 50 minutes. Sprinkle tops with sea salt immediately. Cool completely in the pan before cutting into 9 squares, wiping the knife clean after each cut.
