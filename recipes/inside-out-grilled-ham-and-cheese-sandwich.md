## Ingredients

- ½ cup shredded extra-sharp Cheddar cheese
- ¼ cup shredded Swiss cheese
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 2 slices white bread
- 2 thin slices  ham

## Instructions

1. Mix the shredded cheeses together in a small bowl.
2. Melt butter in the bottom of a fry pan over medium heat. Add one slice of bread. Top the piece of bread with about 1/2 of the cheese mixture and the ham slices. Top with the second piece of bread.
3. Place 1/2 of the remaining cheese on top of the second slice of bread and carefully turn the sandwich over to grill the cheese. Cook about 3 to 4 minutes, or until the cheese on the bottom is slightly crispy. While it is cooking, add the remaining cheese on what is now the top piece of bread.
4. Flip the sandwich and cook another 3 to 4 minutes to crisp the cheese on the second side. Remove to a plate, slice in half, and enjoy!
