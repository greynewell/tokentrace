## Ingredients

- 6  pork chop cutlets
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon seasoning salt
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- 2 large eggs, beaten
- 2 cups dry bread crumbs
- ¼ cup olive oil
- aluminum foil

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Season pork chops with garlic powder and seasoning salt. Dredge chops in flour; shake off excess. Dip into beaten egg. Lift up so excess egg drips back in the bowl. Press into bread crumbs to coat both sides. Place the breaded chops, unstacked, onto a plate.
3. Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat; add pork chops and cook until well browned, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer pork chops into a 9x13-inch baking dish and cover with aluminum foil.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until pork chops are cooked through, 60 to 90 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
