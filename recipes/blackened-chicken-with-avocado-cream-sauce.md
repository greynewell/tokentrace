## Ingredients

- 2 cups reduced-sodium chicken broth
- 1 cup quinoa
- ½ cup chopped scallions
- 1 ½ teaspoons lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- ½ teaspoon sea salt
- 4 (4 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- non-stick cooking spray
- ½  avocado
- ¼ cup plain non-fat Greek-style yogurt
- 1 ½ teaspoons lemon juice
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder

## Instructions

1. Make the quinoa: Bring chicken broth to a boil in a saucepan. Stir quinoa into the broth and bring to a boil again; reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and broth has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir scallions and lemon juice into the quinoa.
2. Prepare the chicken: Mix paprika, cumin, onion powder, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and salt together in a small bowl; rub onto chicken breasts to season completely.
3. Prepare a large skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium-high heat.
4. Lay chicken breasts into the hot skillet, cover skillet with a lid, and cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
5. Make the avocado cream sauce: Blend avocado, yogurt, lemon juice, and garlic powder in a food processor until smooth.
6. Spread quinoa onto a serving platter. Arrange chicken breasts onto the platter. Drizzle avocado cream sauce over the chicken breasts.
