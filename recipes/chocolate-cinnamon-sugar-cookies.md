## Ingredients

- 1 cup butter
- 2 (1 ounce) squares unsweetened chocolate
- 1 (1 ounce) square milk chocolate
- ¾ cup white sugar, divided, or as needed
- ½ cup packed brown sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ¼ teaspoon salt

## Instructions

1. Microwave butter, unsweetened chocolate, and milk chocolate in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl for 15-second intervals, stirring after each interval, until butter is melted, about 2 minutes. Remove from the microwave and stir until chocolate is melted and combined.
2. Stir 1/2 cup white and brown sugar into the melted chocolate mixture until well blended. Stir in egg and vanilla extract until completely blended.
3. Mix together flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt in a large bowl. Add chocolate mixture to flour mixture, mixing until well combined. Place dough in the refrigerator to cool for 30 minutes.
4. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place remaining 1/4 cup white sugar in a small, shallow bowl.
5. Remove dough from the refrigerator and roll into 1-inch balls; knead dough before shaping if too firm. Roll balls in sugar, place 1 inch apart on ungreased cookie sheets, and flatten with the bottom of a glass or a spatula.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are set, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from cookie sheets to cool on wire racks.
