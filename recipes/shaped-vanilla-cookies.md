## Ingredients

- 1 cup margarine
- 1 cup white sugar
- 2  eggs

## Instructions

1. Cream together the margarine, sugar and eggs. Stir in vanilla, flour, baking soda and salt.
2. Roll out (not too thin) and cut into any shape. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 8 minutes.
3. I have used confectioner sugar frosting, or buttercream frosting, or even canned frosting ( if I'm desperate). Enjoy!
