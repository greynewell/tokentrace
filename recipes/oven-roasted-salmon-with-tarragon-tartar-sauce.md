## Ingredients

- 1 (1 1/2-pound) salmon fillet
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 medium lemon, sliced
- 1 teaspoon minced fresh tarragon
- ½ cup mayonnaise
- ½ cup sour cream
- 2 tablespoons minced fresh tarragon
- 2 tablespoons dill pickle relish
- 2 tablespoons drained capers, minced
- 1 tablespoon minced shallot
- 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
- 1 tablespoon minced lemon zest
- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- ½ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1 dash hot pepper sauce (such as Tabasco®), or to taste
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
2. Remove salmon skin and any pin bones; pat dry. Rub both sides with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Arrange on the baking skeet.
3. Roast in the preheated oven until the thickest part is still translucent and an instant-read thermometer reads at least 125 degrees F (52 degrees C), about 15 minutes; salmon will continue to cook once out of the oven.
4. While salmon is roasting, prepare tartar sauce: combine mayonnaise, sour cream, tarragon, relish, capers, shallot, white wine vinegar, lemon zest, Dijon, sugar, Worcestershire, hot sauce, salt, and pepper in a bowl; mix until blended. Chill to blend flavors until salmon is ready.
5. Remove salmon from the oven. Transfer to a platter and garnish with lemon slices and tarragon. Serve with tartar sauce.
