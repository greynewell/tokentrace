## Ingredients

- 4 tablespoons butter
- 1  onion, thinly sliced and quartered
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 4 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 2 cups beef broth
- 1 ½ cups sliced baby bella mushrooms, or more to taste
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
- 4  center-cut pork chops
- ½ teaspoon salt, or to taste
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste
- cooking spray

## Instructions

1. Melt butter in a 3-quart saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook onion and garlic in the butter, stirring occasionally, until is browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove onion and garlic and set aside.
2. Stir flour slowly into butter. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until flour is deep brown, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat. Gradually stir in broth. Add onion, garlic, mushrooms, and parsley. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Remove from heat.
3. Coat a large skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium-high heat. Season pork chops with salt and pepper and brown in the hot pan, 5 to 7 minutes per side. Add gravy mixture from the saucepan. Cover and cook over low heat until tender and no longer pink in the centers, 30 to 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
