## Ingredients

- 2 pounds veal cutlets
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon seasoning salt
- ½ cup butter
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- ¾ pound fresh mushrooms, quartered
- ¼ cup Marsala wine

## Instructions

1. Place veal between 2 sheets of heavy plastic on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound veal with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a 1/4-inch thickness.
2. Combine flour and seasoning salt in a shallow dish; dredge veal in flour mixture and let rest on a wire rack for 15 minutes.
3. Melt butter and oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add floured cutlets and cook until browned, about 1 1/2 minutes on each side. Add mushrooms, reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until tender, about 8 to 10 minutes.
4. Pour in Marsala and simmer until veal is tender and sauce is hot, about 5 minutes more. Serve immediately.
