## Ingredients

- 1 (4 pound) whole chicken
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 teaspoon dried marjoram
- 1 tablespoon dried basil
- 1 (4 ounce) can canned green chile peppers, chopped
- 4  habanero peppers, seeded and minced
- 1  onion, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 5  carrots, chopped
- 5 stalks celery, chopped
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can stewed tomatoes  (Optional)
- 3  potatoes, peeled and cubed
- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Put the chicken in a large pot over medium heat and add water to cover. Add the cumin, thyme, marjoram and basil. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium low and simmer for 2 1/2 hours (or pressure cook for 45 minutes). Remove the chicken from the pot and allow it to cool. Discard the bones and the skin and chop the chicken meat into bite-size pieces.
2. Return the chicken to the pot and add the green chile peppers, habanero chile peppers, onion, garlic, carrots, celery, tomatoes and potatoes. Simmer for 30 minutes, or until the potatoes and carrots are tender (or pressure cook for 10 minutes). In a separate small bowl, mix the flour with some water and add to the soup, stirring well so the flour does not clump. Raise heat, bring just to a boil and remove from heat. Season with salt and pepper to taste and serve.
