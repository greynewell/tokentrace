## Ingredients

- 2 (16 ounce) packages frozen mixed berries
- ¼ cup white sugar
- ¼ cup brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons cornstarch
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- ¼ cup white sugar
- ¼ cup brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ cup cold butter, cut into cubes
- 2 cups rolled oats
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 cup brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 ½ cups cold butter, cut into pieces

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
2. Mix together berries, 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, and 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon for the filling in a bowl until well combined. Pour into a separate, ungreased baking dish.
3. Bake filling in the preheated oven until berries are hot, about 10 minutes.
4. While berries are baking, mix together flour, 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar, baking powder, and salt for the crust in a bowl. Cut in 1/2 cup cold butter with a pastry blender until crumbly. Spread crust mixture into the bottom of the prepared 9x13-inch baking dish and pour hot berry filling on top.
5. Mix together oats, 1 cup flour, 1 cup brown sugar, and 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon for the topping in a bowl. Cut in 1 1/2 cups cold butter with a pastry blender until crumbly. Sprinkle topping over the berry filling.
