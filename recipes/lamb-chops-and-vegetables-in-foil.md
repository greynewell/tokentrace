## Ingredients

- aluminum foil
- 6 (8 ounce) lamb shoulder chops
- 3 tablespoons minced garlic
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 2 sprigs chopped fresh rosemary
- 3 small zucchini, halved
- 6 small carrots, halved
- 8 ounces mushrooms, halved
- 3  onions, sliced
- 6 tablespoons butter
- 6 teaspoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
- 1 (8 ounce) package feta cheese, cut into 6 squares

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Place 1 piece of heavy duty aluminum foil vertically on a work surface and 1 large piece aluminum foil horizontally on top, large enough to cover 1 lamb chop and vegetables..
3. Place 1 lamb chop in the middle of the aluminum foil and rub with 1/2 tablespoon garlic, salt, pepper, and rosemary. Repeat with remaining chops.
4. Stack zucchini, carrots, mushrooms, and onion on top of each lamb chop. Place 1 tablespoon of butter on top and drizzle with 1 teaspoon of lemon juice. Top each with 1 square of feta cheese. Tightly seal each package by wrapping the first piece of foil around the meat and vegetables, followed by the second.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until lamb is cooked but still pink in the center. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a chop should read at least 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Serve each person their own individual parcel.
