## Ingredients

- 1 (15.25 ounce) package carrot cake mix
- 1 cup water
- ⅔ cup vegetable oil
- 3  eggs
- 2 ½ cups milk
- 1 (5 ounce) package instant vanilla pudding mix
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- 1 (8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping (such as Cool Whip®), thawed
- 1 cup chopped almonds
- 1 cup shredded coconut
- 1 cup toffee baking bits (such as Heath®)

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
2. Beat cake mix, water, vegetable oil, and eggs together in a bowl using an electric mixer on low speed, about 30 seconds; increase speed to medium and beat until batter is evenly mixed, scraping sides of bowl as needed. Pour batter into the prepared baking dish.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, 31 to 36 minutes. Cool cake in pan for 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely. Keep oven at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
4. Beat milk and pudding mix together in a bowl until evenly combined and thickened; beat in cream cheese until filling is smooth. Fold whipped topping into filling.
5. Spread almonds and coconut onto a baking sheet.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until toasted and fragrant, 5 to 10 minutes.
7. Cut cake into bite-size pieces; spread 1 layer, 1-cube deep, into a trifle dish or glass bowl. Spoon a layer of filling, about the same depth as cake layer, over cake layer. Sprinkle a layer of almonds, coconut, and toffee bits over filling. Repeat layering with remaining ingredients.
