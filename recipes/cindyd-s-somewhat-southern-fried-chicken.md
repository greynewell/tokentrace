## Ingredients

- 2  eggs
- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon rubbed sage
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ teaspoon onion powder
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- 2 cups vegetable oil for frying, or as needed
- 4  chicken leg quarters, cut into thighs and drumsticks

## Instructions

1. Beat the eggs thoroughly in a shallow bowl. Sift together the flour, sage, salt, black pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder in a bowl to combine.
2. Heat the vegetable oil in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. Oil should be about 2 inches deep. Dip chicken pieces into the beaten egg, then dredge in the seasoned flour to thoroughly coat.
3. Fry chicken in the hot oil until golden brown on the first side, about 10 minutes; reduce heat to medium, and fry chicken on second side until golden brown and the meat is no longer pink inside, about 20 more minutes. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a thigh should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
