## Ingredients

- 1 ½ pounds tomatoes, chopped
- ⅓ large onion, chopped
- 3 tablespoons chopped celery
- ½ teaspoon chopped celery
- ⅜  carrot, chopped
- ¼  beet
- ⅛  green bell pepper, seeded and chopped
- ⅓ clove garlic
- 2 ⅓ cups water, or as needed
- 1 ¼ teaspoons white sugar
- 1 ½ teaspoons lemon juice
- ¼ teaspoon horseradish
- ¼ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce, or to taste
- ⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 1 ¼ teaspoons salt
- 1  (1 quart) sterilized canning jar with lid and ring

## Instructions

1. Process tomatoes, onion, 3 tablespoons and 1/2 teaspoon chopped celery, carrot, beet, green bell pepper, and garlic through a juicer.
2. Stir vegetable juices, water, 1 1/4 teaspoons white sugar, lemon juice, horseradish, Worcestershire sauce, and black pepper together in a large pot. Bring to a boil and cook until flavors blend, about 20 minutes.
3. Sterilize the jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Ladle juice into a quart jar. Stir 1 tablespoon white sugar and 1 teaspoon salt into the juice. Wipe the rim of the jar with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lid and screw on ring.
4. Process juice in a pressure canner at 10 pounds of pressure for 35 minutes.
5. Remove the jar from the pressure canner and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface until cool. Once cool, press the top of the lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all). Store in a cool, dark area.
