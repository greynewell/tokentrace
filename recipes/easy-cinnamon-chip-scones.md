## Ingredients

- ¾ cup butter
- 3 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
- ⅓ cup white sugar
- 2 ½ teaspoons baking powder
- ½ pinch baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup buttermilk
- 1 (10 ounce) package cinnamon baking chips
- 2 tablespoons butter, melted
- 2 tablespoons white sugar

## Instructions

1. Place 3/4 cup butter into the freezer for 1 hour. Cut into cubes.
2. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
3. Combine flour, 1/3 cup sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl using a whisk. Cut in very cold cubed butter with a pastry blender or using your fingers until you get coarse crumbs.
4. Create a well in the flour mixture; add buttermilk and stir gently until dough is just moistened. Fold in cinnamon chips.
5. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead gently until dough is no longer sticky, 10 to 12 times, and divide in half. Pat or roll each portion gently into a 7-inch circle. Brush melted butter over circles. Sprinkle each with 1 tablespoon sugar. Cut each circle into 6 wedges. Separate and place scones on an ungreased baking sheet.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 10 to 13 minutes. Serve warm.
