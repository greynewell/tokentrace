## Ingredients

- ½ cup butter, melted
- 3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 loaf Italian bread
- 12 ounces shredded Italian cheese blend

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Mix melted butter, parsley, olive oil, and garlic together in a bowl.
3. Slice bread diagonally without cutting all the way through; do the same on the opposite diagonal to create cube-shaped sections still attached to the bottom crust.
4. Spoon butter mixture carefully between sections; stuff in shredded Italian cheese blend. Wrap loaf in aluminum foil.
5. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes; unwrap and bake until cheese is melted, about 10 minutes more.
