## Ingredients

- 3  zucchini, ends trimmed
- 4 (3 ounce) cans tuna, drained and flaked
- ¼  onion, grated
- 1  tomato, finely chopped  (Optional)
- 1 cup dry bread crumbs
- 1  egg, beaten
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon olive oil

## Instructions

1. Fill a large pot with salted water, place the zucchini into the pot, and boil over medium heat for about 5 minutes to soften. Remove the zucchini, slice in half lengthwise, and allow to cool.
2. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
3. Scoop out the flesh from the zucchini halves, leaving a 1/2-inch shell. Set aside the scooped out flesh in a bowl.
4. Place the zucchini flesh into a bowl and mash well. Mix in the tuna, onion, tomato, bread crumbs, egg, salt, and black pepper. Lightly stuff the zucchini shells with the tuna mixture. Drizzle about 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil over each stuffed zucchini half.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until the tops are slightly browned, 20 to 25 minutes.
