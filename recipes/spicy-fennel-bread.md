## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups water, at room temperature
- ½ teaspoon active dry yeast
- 1 pinch white sugar
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons fennel seeds
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt
- 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- ½ teaspoon minced onion
- ½ teaspoon minced garlic

## Instructions

1. Combine water, yeast, and sugar in a measuring cup. Mix well.
2. Combine flour, fennel seeds, salt, red pepper flakes, onion, and garlic in a large bowl. Mix well until combined and any flour clumps are broken up. Slowly pour in the yeast-water mixture and stir into the flour.
3. Knead the bread by hand until dough is well combined and you have an even consistency. Transfer to an oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let rest on the countertop, 10 to 14 hours.
4. Remove dough onto the counter and knead once more. Let rise, 30 minutes to 1 hour.
5. While bread rises, preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Sprinkle the bottom of an oven-safe Dutch oven with flour, cover with the lid, and place in the oven while it preheats.
6. Remove the Dutch oven and carefully place the dough in the pot; cover with the lid.
7. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove the lid and continue to bake until golden, about 30 minutes more. Remove from the oven and place on a rack to cool.
