## Ingredients

- 4 pounds corned beef brisket
- 1 cup brown sugar
- 1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle Irish stout beer (e.g. Guinness(r))

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
2. Rinse beef thoroughly, then pat dry with paper towels and place on a rack in a roasting pan or Dutch oven. Rub brown sugar all over beef. Pour beer around and gently over beef to wet sugar.
3. Bake, covered, in the preheated oven until tender, about 2 1/2 hours. For optimum tenderness, an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 190 degrees F (88 degrees C). Allow to rest 5 minutes before slicing.
