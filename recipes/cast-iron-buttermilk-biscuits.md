## Ingredients

- ½ cup cold butter, divided
- 1 ⅓ cups buttermilk
- 2  eggs
- 4 cups all-purpose flour
- 5 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon cream of tartar
- 1 teaspoon salt

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place 1 tablespoon butter in two 10-inch cast iron skillets.
2. Place skillets in the preheated oven to heat up and melt butter, 5 to 10 minutes.
3. Mix buttermilk and eggs together in a small bowl.
4. Combine flour, baking powder, cream of tartar, and salt in a large bowl. Rub in remaining 6 tablespoons butter with your fingers until mixture is crumbly. Gently stir in buttermilk mixture until dough just starts to come together.
5. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Pat into a rectangle about 1/2 inch thick. Cut dough into 24 biscuits.
6. Remove skillets from the oven. Arrange 12 biscuits side-by-side in each, their edges touching.
7. Return skillets to the oven and bake until biscuits are puffed and lightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes.
