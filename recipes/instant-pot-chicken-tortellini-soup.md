## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon salted butter
- ½ pound cubed boneless, skinless chicken breast
- ½ cup chopped onion
- ½ cup chopped carrots
- 2 cloves minced garlic
- 1 cup chicken broth
- ½ (8 ounce) package refrigerated cheese tortellini
- 1 tablespoon chicken broth
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
- ¾ cup fat-free half-and-half
- ¾ cup chopped fresh spinach
- ½ teaspoon dried thyme
- ½ teaspoon garlic salt
- ¼ teaspoon black pepper

## Instructions

1. Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and select Saute function. Add butter and melt. Add chicken, onion, carrots, and garlic. Saute until chicken is golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Hit Cancel.
2. Stir in 1 cup chicken broth. Push chicken and vegetables to one side of the pot. Add tortellini in a single layer to the other side. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 7 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
3. Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, 15 minutes. Release remaining pressure using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions. Unlock and remove the lid.
4. Stir 1 tablespoon chicken broth and flour together in a microwave-safe bowl. Stir in half-and-half. Microwave on high, stirring every 20 seconds, until mixture has thickened, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer flour slurry into the pot and stir to combine. Add spinach, thyme, garlic salt, and pepper. Stir until spinach has wilted. Serve immediately.
