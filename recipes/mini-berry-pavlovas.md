## Ingredients

- 4  egg whites
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 teaspoon cornstarch
- ½ teaspoon cream of tartar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 pinch salt
- 1 cup whipped cream, or more to taste
- ¾ cup sliced fresh berries, or more to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Beat egg whites in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl on medium speed with an electric mixer until until soft peaks form, about 3 minutes. Slowly add sugar, cornstarch, and cream of tartar and continue beating on high speed until stiff, glossy peaks form, 3 to 5 minutes. Add vanilla extract and salt and beat until combined, about 30 seconds.
3. Scoop the meringue with a spring-hinged scoop onto the prepared baking sheet and shape into individual rounds about 3 inches in diameter. Use the back of a spoon to create an indentation in the center of the meringue.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until the meringue is dry to the touch, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Transfer the parchment with the meringues on it to a wire rack and allow to cool. Once meringues are cool to the touch, remove from parchment and place directly on the rack to cool completely, about 1 hour.
5. When ready to serve, top each meringue with whipped cream and garnish with fresh berries.
