## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 18  refrigerated biscuits (unbaked)
- 8 ounces breakfast sausage
- 7 large eggs
- ½ cup milk
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 cup mild shredded Cheddar cheese

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 18 muffin cups with cooking spray.
2. Roll out biscuit dough on a lightly floured surface to form 5-inch rounds. Place each round in the prepared muffin cups, pressing into the base and sides to form a dough cup.
3. Cook and stir sausage in a skillet over medium-high heat until browned and cooked through, 5 to 10 minutes; drain fat. Spoon sausage into dough cups.
4. Whisk eggs, milk, salt, and pepper together in a bowl until well-beaten. Pour egg mixture into each dough cup, filling each just below the top of the biscuit dough. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese on top of egg mixture.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until eggs are set and biscuit dough is golden, 15 to 18 minutes.
