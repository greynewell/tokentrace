## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1  onion, diced
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 ¼ pounds ground turkey
- ½ cup cold water
- ¾ cup ketchup
- 1 ½ tablespoons brown sugar
- ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste
- ½ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
- ½ teaspoon unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 cup water, or as needed
- 6  hamburger buns, split
- ⅓ cup chopped green onions
- ½ cup shredded white Cheddar cheese

## Instructions

1. Melt butter in a heavy skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in butter until lightly brown, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper.
2. Mix turkey and 1/2 cup cold water into onions. Cook and stir, breaking up the meat, until it begins to brown, about 2 minutes. Add ketchup, brown sugar, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper. Cook and stir until liquid is reduced, about 5 minutes.
3. Stir in Worcestershire sauce and cocoa powder. Cook, stirring frequently, until meat is cooked through and liquid is reduced and thick, 20 to 30 minutes, adding up to 1 cup water if needed.
4. Preheat the oven's broiler. Set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source.
5. Toast hamburger buns under the preheated broiler until golden, 2 to 3 minutes.
