## Ingredients

- ½ cup brown sugar
- ⅓ cup fresh lemon juice
- ¼ cup white vinegar
- ¼ cup apple cider vinegar
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- ¼ cup molasses
- 2 cups prepared mustard
- 2 teaspoons dried minced garlic
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
- ½ teaspoon white pepper
- ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 2 racks pork spareribs
- ½ cup barbeque seasoning, or to taste

## Instructions

1. In a medium bowl, whisk together brown sugar, lemon juice, white vinegar, cider vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, molasses, and mustard. Season with garlic, salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, white pepper, and cayenne pepper; mix well and set aside.
2. Preheat an outdoor grill or smoker to 225 to 250 degrees F (110 to 120 degrees C).
3. Rub ribs liberally with barbeque seasoning, then place them in the smoker or grill, and cover. Cook for 4 hours, or until very tender. The meat will easily separate from the bone. Baste ribs with mustard sauce liberally during the final 30 minutes. Heat remaining sauce to a boil and serve on the side.
