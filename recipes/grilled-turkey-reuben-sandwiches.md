## Ingredients

- 1 cup sauerkraut, drained
- 10 ounces sliced deli turkey meat
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 4 slices marble rye bread
- 4 slices Swiss cheese
- 4 tablespoons thousand island salad dressing, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Place turkey on a microwave-safe plate, and sauerkraut in a microwave-safe bowl. Warm them separately in the microwave for 30 seconds each.
2. Spread butter generously on one side of each slice of rye bread. Lay bread slices, buttered-sides down, on a work surface. Spread Thousand Island dressing on the tops of each slice.
3. Divide warmed sauerkraut between two slices of bread. Top those slices with 1/2 of the turkey, then 1/2 of the Swiss cheese. Flip the remaining two bread slices over top to create sandwiches.
4. Heat a large skillet over medium-low heat. Transfer the sandwiches to the hot skillet and cook until the bread is lightly browned and the cheese is melted, about 3 minutes per side.
