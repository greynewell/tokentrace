## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups graham cracker crumbs
- ¼ cup finely ground walnuts
- 1 tablespoon cinnamon sugar
- ½ cup butter, melted
- 3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
- ¾ cup white sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 cup heavy whipping cream
- 3  eggs, slightly beaten

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Make crust: Combine graham cracker crumbs, walnuts, and cinnamon sugar in the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan. Add melted butter and mix well. Press into the bottom of the pan and 1 to 2 inches up the sides. Place in the freezer to set up.
3. While crust chills, make filling: Beat cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla in a large bowl with an electric hand mixer until combined. Add heavy cream slowly while beating on low speed; mix until smooth. Add eggs, one at a time, beating on low speed until combined. Remove crust from the freezer and pour in filling.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until center appears almost set when gently shaken, 35 to 45 minutes. Remove cheesecake carefully from the oven and place on a wire rack to cool, about 15 minutes.
5. Slide a butter knife around the outer edge to separate cheesecake from the pan. Let cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Unclip the side of the pan and remove the ring. Let cool for another 30 minutes; chill in the refrigerator at least 4 hours to overnight before serving.
