## Ingredients

- 2  russet potatoes, peeled
- 3 tablespoons clarified butter
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
- 1 pinch paprika, or to taste

## Instructions

2. Heat clarified butter in a large non-stick pan over medium heat. Sprinkle shredded potatoes into the hot butter and season with salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and paprika.
