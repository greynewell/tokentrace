## Ingredients

- 1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ teaspoons baking powder
- 1 cup white sugar
- ½ cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 2 large eggs
- ½ cup buttermilk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 cup fresh blueberries, or more to taste
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 2 ½ tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
2. Combine flour and baking powder in a medium bowl and set aside.
3. Combine sugar and butter in a small bowl; mix for about 1 minute. Add eggs and mix well; add buttermilk and vanilla extract, mixing until well incorporated. Pour over the dry ingredients and mix until incorporated. Fold in blueberries with a rubber spatula. Pour batter into the prepared bread pan.
4. Mix sugar, flour, and butter together in a bowl with your fingers until the butter is mixed in well with the flour and sugar. Sprinkle the topping over the batter.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 55 to 60 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 10 minutes. Run a knife around the edges and remove the loaf from the pan and let cool completely on a wire rack.
