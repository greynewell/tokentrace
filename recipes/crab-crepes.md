## Ingredients

- 2 cups flour
- 1 cup cold water
- 4  eggs
- 2 tablespoons melted butter
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 4 tablespoons butter
- ½ cup chopped green onion
- ¾ cup dry sherry
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 3 cups fresh crabmeat, cooked and diced
- 4 tablespoons butter
- 6 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 2 cups hot milk
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ cup heavy cream
- 2  egg yolks
- 1 cup grated Swiss cheese

## Instructions

1. Make the crêpes: Place flour, water, eggs, melted butter, and salt into a blender. Cover and blend for 2 minutes. Chill batter in the refrigerator for two hours.
2. Heat an oiled, non-stick skillet over medium heat. Pour in enough of the chilled batter to cover half of the skillet. Tip and rotate the skillet until the batter covers the entire area. Cook until the batter turns from wet to moist, and the edges begin to curl away from the sides of the skillet. Turn the crêpe over, and continue cooking until lightly golden on the other side. Place the crêpe onto a plate, and cover with a kitchen towel to keep moist. Repeat with the remaining batter, lightly oiling the skillet as needed to keep the crêpes from sticking.
3. Prepare the filling: Heat butter in a skillet over medium-high heat and cook and stir green onions until tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Add sherry, salt, and pepper; stir to combine. Mix in crab.
4. Make the sauce: Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Whisk in flour. Add milk, salt, and pepper; bring to a boil for 1 minute. Remove from heat.
5. Beat heavy cream and egg yolks together in a small bowl. Gradually add egg mixture to butter-flour mixture, stirring constantly. Fold in grated cheese to form a thick sauce.
6. Pour sauce into crab meat mixture, reserving 1 cup of the sauce; stir to combine.
7. Lay out one crêpe on a flat surface. Spoon 2 heaping spoonfuls of crab mixture at one end of the crêpe, then roll crêpe up around the filling. Repeat with remaining crêpes. Top each with reserved cheese sauce and serve.
