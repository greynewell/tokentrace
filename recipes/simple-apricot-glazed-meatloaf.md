## Ingredients

- 1 ½ pounds ground beef
- 1 cup bread crumbs
- 1 small onion, minced

- 1 cup ketchup
- ½ cup apricot preserves
- ¼ cup brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons hot sauce (such as Frank's Red Hot ®)  (Optional)
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
