## Ingredients

- ⅔ (16 ounce) package graham crackers, crushed into fine crumbs
- 1 ¼ sticks butter, melted
- 2 large apples - peeled, cored, and sliced
- 1 teaspoon brown sugar
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ¼ teaspoon nutmeg
- 2 ½ (8 ounce) packages cream cheese
- 1 (8 ounce) container mascarpone cheese
- ⅔ cup white sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 3  eggs

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 9-inch springform pan with parchment paper or grease with butter.
2. Combine graham cracker crumbs and butter in a large bowl to create a grainy mixture. Reserve 1/4 cup and distribute remaining crust evenly onto the base of the prepared springform pan. Set aside.
3. Combine apple slices, brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a bowl and toss to coat. Set aside.
4. Combine cream cheese, mascarpone cheese, sugar, and vanilla extract in a large bowl and mix using an electric mixer. Add eggs 1 at a time. Beat until well integrated, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour filling into the crust-lined pan and smooth using a spatula.
5. Arrange apple slices on top of filling in a circular "deck of cards" arrangement. Sprinkle reserved crust mixture on top.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until edges begin to firm up, apples soften, and center remains jiggly, 30 to 40 minutes.
7. Cool for 6 to 8 hours before serving.
