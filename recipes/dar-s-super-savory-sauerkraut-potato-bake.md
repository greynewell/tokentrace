## Ingredients

- ⅓ cup all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons chicken bouillon granules
- 1 cup water
- 1 cup milk
- ¼ cup sour cream
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
- 1 cup drained sauerkraut
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ teaspoon caraway seeds  (Optional)
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
- 1 (16 ounce) package frozen shredded hash brown potatoes

## Instructions

1. Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
2. Whisk the flour, bouillon granules, water, and milk together in a medium saucepan; bring to a boil until thick, 1 to 2 minutes, whisking continuously. Remove from heat and stir the sour cream into the flour mixture; set aside to cool.

Stir the sour cream sauce and the melted butter into the sauerkraut mixture; fold the hash brown potatoes into the mixture. Pour into the prepared baking dish.
