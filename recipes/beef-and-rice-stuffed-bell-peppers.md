## Ingredients

- 6  bell peppers
- 2 ½ cups chunky tomato sauce
- ½  onion, very thinly sliced
- 1 cup beef broth
- ¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 1 ½ pounds lean ground beef
- 1 ½ cups cooked rice
- ½ cup freshly shredded Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
- ¼ cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
- ½ cup chunky tomato sauce, divided
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 teaspoons salt
- ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, divided

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Slice peppers 1/2-inch from the top; cut out stems and set aside tops. Cut core from the inside of peppers and strip away any seeds. Cut off a thin slice from the bottoms so peppers can stand upright. Poke about 4 tiny holes in the bottoms to let juices drain.
3. Pour 2 1/2 cups tomato sauce into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Add onion, beef broth, and red pepper flakes; spread out mixture evenly over the bottom. Set bell peppers upright in the dish.
4. Combine ground beef, cooked rice, Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, 2 tablespoons tomato sauce, 1/4 cup parsley, garlic, salt, and black pepper in a large mixing bowl.
5. Lightly stuff peppers with meat mixture. Spread 1 tablespoon tomato sauce on top of each portion of stuffing; place reserved tops onto peppers. Lay a piece of parchment paper loosely on top of peppers and cover the dish tightly with foil. Place the dish on top of a baking sheet.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until peppers have softened slightly, about 1 hour. Remove foil and parchment paper. Continue baking until meat filling is cooked through and peppers are tender, 20 to 30 more minutes.
7. Sprinkle each pepper with 1/2 teaspoon parsley and drizzle with a spoonful of pan juices.
