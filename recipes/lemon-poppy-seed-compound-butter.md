## Ingredients

- 1 stick salted butter, softened
- 1 medium lemon, zested
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice
- ¾ teaspoon poppy seeds
- ½ teaspoon honey

## Instructions

1. Combine butter, lemon zest, lemon juice, poppy seeds, and honey in a small bowl.
2. Place butter on top of a sheet of plastic wrap. Shape into a log. Fold one side of the plastic wrap over the log and roll into a tube, shaping with your fingers as you roll tightly. Twist the ends to seal.
3. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour or until firm. The longer it sits, the more the flavors will develop. Unroll from plastic wrap and slice.
