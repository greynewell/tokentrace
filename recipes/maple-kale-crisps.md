## Ingredients

- 1 bunch kale - stems removed and discarded, leaves torn into even pieces
- 1 tablespoon extra light olive oil

2. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
3. Blot kale thoroughly dry with paper towels if leaves are damp from washing.
4. Arrange kale pieces onto the prepared baking sheet in a single layer and drizzle with olive oil and maple syrup; sprinkle with sea salt.
