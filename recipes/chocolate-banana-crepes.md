## Ingredients

- ½ cup whole or 2% milk
- 1 ½ tablespoons melted butter
- 1  egg yolk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 2 teaspoons hazelnut liqueur
- 1 tablespoon cocoa
- 2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar
- ⅓ cup white flour
- ½ tablespoon butter
- 1 tablespoon whole or 2% milk
- 2 teaspoons hazelnut liqueur
- 1 tablespoon cocoa
- 2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar
- 2  ripe bananas, sliced

## Instructions

1. In a medium bowl, stir together 1/2 cup milk, 1 1/2 tablespoons melted butter, egg yolk, vanilla, and 2 teaspoons hazelnut liqueur. Whisk 1 tablespoon cocoa into liquid until completely incorporated. Next, whisk in 2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar until completely incorporated. Then gradually whisk in flour until completely incorporated. Set aside.
2. Melt 1/2 tablespoon butter in a saucepan over low heat. Stir 1 tablespoon milk and 2 teaspoons hazelnut liqueur into melted butter. Stir in 1 tablespoon cocoa and 2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar. Set over very low heat to keep warm.
3. Spray a non-stick frying pan or crepe pan with cooking spray, and heat over medium heat. Pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto the pan, and swirl to form a very thin disk; cook for about 2 minutes. Flip, and cook about 1 minute more.
4. Place crepe on a plate. Add 1/4 sliced bananas to crepe, and spoon 1/4 of the chocolate sauce over the bananas. Roll or fold crepe, and sprinkle with confectioners' sugar. Repeat steps 3 and 4. Serve crepes warm.
