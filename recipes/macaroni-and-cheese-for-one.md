## Ingredients

- 1 cup elbow macaroni
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
- ¾ cup fat-free half-and-half
- ¾ cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
- ¼ teaspoon dry mustard powder
- 1 pinch ground black pepper
- 1 pinch ground turmeric

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes.
