## Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon canola oil
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic
- ¼ cup diced (yellow or purple) onion
- 2 ½ cups water
- 2 teaspoons salt, or to taste
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 2 cups quinoa
- ¾ cup diced fresh tomato
- ¾ cup diced carrots
- ½ cup diced yellow bell pepper
- ½ cup diced cucumber
- ½ cup frozen corn kernels, thawed
- ¼ cup diced red onion
- 1 ½ tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar

## Instructions

1. Heat the canola oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir the garlic and 1/4 cup onion in the hot oil until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Pour in the water, 2 teaspoons salt, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper and bring to a boil; stir the quinoa into the mixture, reduce heat to medium-low, and cover. Simmer until the quinoa is tender, about 20 minutes. Drain any remaining water from the quinoa with a mesh strainer and transfer to a large mixing bowl. Refrigerate until cold.
2. Stir the tomato, carrots, bell pepper, cucumber, corn, and 1/4 cup red onion into the chilled quinoa. Season with cilantro, mint, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Drizzle the olive oil and balsamic vinegar over the salad; gently stir until evenly mixed.
