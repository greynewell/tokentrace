## Ingredients

- 2 cups whole wheat flour
- 2 teaspoons baking soda
- 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ cup vanilla yogurt
- ¼ cup vegetable oil
- ⅓ cup honey
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 tablespoons orange juice
- 1 cup carrot, peeled and shredded
- ½ cup raisins

## Instructions

1. Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 14 muffin cups, or line with paper muffin liners.
2. Combine flour, baking soda, pumpkin pie spice, and salt in a bowl. Whisk together yogurt, vegetable oil, honey, vanilla extract, and orange juice in a separate bowl.
