## Ingredients

- 1 pound collard greens - rinsed, trimmed and chopped
- 2 cups water
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- ¾ cup chopped onions
- 8 cloves garlic, chopped
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 ½ cups sliced green bell pepper
- 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground turmeric
- ½ teaspoon paprika
- ½ teaspoon ground allspice
- 2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger root

## Instructions

1. Place chopped collard greens in a pot with 2 cups of water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Cover, and simmer until collards are tender, about 20 minutes. Drain, but reserve the cooking water. Set aside.
2. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a pot over medium heat. Stir in onions and cook until just beginning to brown, about 10 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add the cooked collards, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and the reserved cooking water. Simmer, uncovered, over medium-high heat until liquid is nearly evaporated, 10 to 15 minutes.
3. Add the green pepper slices, lemon juice, salt, turmeric, paprika, allspice, and ginger root. Cook until peppers are soft, about 5 minutes.
