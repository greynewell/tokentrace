## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- ⅓ cup canola oil
- 1 large egg
- 3 tablespoons white sugar
- ½ teaspoon baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ cup warm water
- 2 cups canola oil for frying
- ½ cup white sugar
- ¼ cup water
- ¼ teaspoon ground cardamom

## Instructions

1. Mix flour, 1/3 cup canola oil, egg, 3 tablespoons sugar, baking powder, and salt together in the bowl of a stand mixer with an paddle attachment. Add 1/4 cup water slowly and mix until a soft dough is formed, 4 to 5 minutes. Let dough rest for 30 minutes.
2. Cut dough into about thirty 1-inch pieces. Press each piece onto the back of a fork and curl it out away from you to make the shushumow.
3. Heat 2 cups oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan over medium heat. Fry shushumow a few at a time, stirring slowly, until golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain on paper towels.
4. Combine 1/2 cup sugar, 1/4 cup water, and cardamom in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and let simmer until sugar is dissolved, 1 to 2 minutes more. Remove from heat. Stir in the shushumow gently until coated in the syrup. Transfer shushumow to a plate and let cool.
