## Ingredients

- non-stick cooking spray
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 2 teaspoons cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon ground ginger
- 1 pinch freshly grated nutmeg
- 4  large eggs
- 1 ½ cups white sugar
- ½ cup light brown sugar
- 1 cup vegetable oil
- ¼ cup melted butter
- 2 cups mashed sweet potato (yams)
- 1 cup chopped pecans, plus more for topping
- 2 teaspoons demerara sugar for topping

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line muffins tins with paper muffin liners. Spray with non-stick cooking spray.
2. Whisk flour, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, baking soda, ground ginger, and nutmeg together in a mixing bowl.
3. In a separate bowl, whisk eggs, white sugar, and brown sugar together until mixture gets light and foamy, about 2 minutes. Pour in vegetable oil and melted butter; whisk together thoroughly. Add mashed sweet potatoes and chopped pecans. Add dry ingredients. Whisk together until dry ingredients disappear into the batter, about 1 minutes. Let batter set for 10 minutes before filling muffin cups.
4. Fill muffin cups about 3/4 of the way to the top. Sprinkle tops with pecans and a pinch of demerara sugar.
5. Bake until a bamboo skewer inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Let cool in pan about 10 minutes; transfer muffins to a cooling rack to cool completely.
