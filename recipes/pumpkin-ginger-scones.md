## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- ⅓ cup brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon ground ginger
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ½ cup unsalted butter, cut into pieces
- ⅓ cup raisins  (Optional)
- ¼ cup chopped toasted pecans  (Optional)
- ½ cup pure pumpkin puree
- ⅓ cup buttermilk, or more as needed
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- 1 large egg
- 1 tablespoon milk
- 1 tablespoon coarse sugar, or as needed
- ½ cup powdered sugar, or as needed
- 2 tablespoons milk
- 1 tablespoon molasses
- ½ teaspoon ground ginger
- ⅛ teaspoon ground cinnamon

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Mix flour, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, ginger, cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, salt, and nutmeg together in a large bowl. Cut the butter into the flour mixture with a pastry blender or fork until mixture looks like coarse crumbs. Stir in raisins and pecans.
3. Whisk pumpkin, buttermilk, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl. Stir into the flour mixture with a wooden spoon, mixing just until dough comes together; do not overmix.
4. Transfer to a lightly floured surface and knead gently, 4 to 5 times; dough will be sticky. Pat into a circle that is about 7 inches across, and about 1 1/2 inches thick. Cut in half, then cut each half into 4 triangular pie-shaped wedges. Place scones onto the prepared baking sheet.
5. Whisk egg and milk together in a bowl. Brush the tops of the scones with egg wash. Sprinkle tops heavily with coarse sugar.
6. Bake on the middle or top rack of the preheated oven until golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the middle of a scone comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Slide scones, still on parchment paper, onto a counter or wire rack to cool.
7. While cooling, combine powdered sugar, milk, molasses, ginger, and cinnamon for the icing in a small saucepan. Heat over medium-high heat until it boils, about 5 minutes. Allow to cool partially, 3 to 5 minutes. Drizzle over scones; allow icing to harden before serving.
