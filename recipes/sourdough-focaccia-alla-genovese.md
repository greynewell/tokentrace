## Ingredients

- 2 ½ cups high-protein bread flour (such as King Arthur Flour®), divided
- 1 cup water, divided
- ¾ cup sourdough starter discard, at room temperature
- 6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided, or as needed
- 1 teaspoon fine sea salt
- 1 tablespoon water
- 12  pitted green olives
- 6  cherry tomatoes, halved
- 1 sprig fresh rosemary
- ½ teaspoon flaked salt

## Instructions

1. Mix 1/2 cup bread flour, 1/4 cup water, and sourdough discard together with a wooden spoon. Add a little flour to the bowl of a stand mixer. Add starter mixture and allow to rise in a warm area, without direct sunlight, until doubled in size, about 2 hours.
2. Attach dough hook and begin to mix the starter. Add remaining flour, 3 tablespoons oil, and 1 teaspoon salt. Mix in enough of the remaining water until dough pulls from the sides of the bowl and forms a ball; you may not need the full 3/4 cup. Knead dough in the mixer for 5 minutes.
3. Transfer dough to a work surface and knead by hand for 5 minutes. Score and cover with a cloth. Allow to rise in a draft-free place until doubled in volume, at least 2 hours, and up to overnight.
4. Lightly oil a shallow 12x16-inch baking pan. Knead dough for 5 minutes. Spread into the pan using your hands. Whisk 1 tablespoon oil and 1 tablespoon water together. Sprinkle a little bit over the focaccia. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled in height.
5. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
6. Push into the focaccia with your fingertips, leaving indentations about 1 1/2 inches apart. Evenly distribute olives and cherry tomatoes on top, pushing them into the dough. Sprinkle rosemary leaves and flaked salt on top. Sprinkle a little more of the oil-water mixture on top.
7. Bake in the preheated oven until browned and cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes. Drizzle olive oil on top before serving.
