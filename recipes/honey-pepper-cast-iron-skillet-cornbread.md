## Ingredients

- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 cup yellow cornmeal
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 3 large eggs
- 1 cup whole milk
- ¼ cup honey

## Instructions

1. Drop butter in a 9-inch cast iron skillet and place on the center rack of the oven; preheat to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Remove skillet from oven as soon as butter melts; this may be before oven reaches set temperature. Tip the skillet until melted butter coats all sides.
2. Combine cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and pepper in a large bowl.
3. Whisk eggs thoroughly in another large bowl. Add milk and honey and whisk until combined. Add dry ingredients and stir just until mixed; pour batter into the prepared skillet. Stir batter in a folding motion to incorporate any remaining melted butter.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and let sit for 5 minutes before cutting and serving.
