## Ingredients

- 2 large starchy potatoes, such as russet or Yukon Gold
- 2 large eggs
- 1 ¾ cups flour, or as needed
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 1 pinch ground nutmeg
- 2 tablespoons butter

## Instructions

1. Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain.
2. Peel cooked potatoes and place into a large bowl. Mash with a potato masher. Add eggs and flour and mix until well combined. Season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg.
3. Use your hands to shape potato dough into oblong dumplings with two pointy ends. If the dough sticks to your hands, rinse them under cold water.
4. Bring water to the boil in a large pot over high heat, then reduce temperature to a simmer. Drop small batches of the dumplings into the just simmering water. Cook until they float on the top. Remove dumplings with a slotted spoon and submerge in a bowl with cold water. Remove with a slotted spoon, put them in a colander, and drain well.
5. Heat butter in a skillet over medium heat and saute Schupfnudeln until golden brown and crisp from all sides, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain on paper towel and keep warm until all Schupfnudeln are done.
