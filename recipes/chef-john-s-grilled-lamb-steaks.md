## Ingredients

- 1 bunch fresh tarragon leaves, torn
- ½ bunch fresh mint leaves, torn
- 2 tablespoons plain yogurt
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 4 cloves garlic, chopped
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 4  center-cut lamb leg steaks, 1 1/2-inch thick
- ¼ cup olive oil
- 3 tablespoons sherry vinegar
- 2 tablespoons honey
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint
- 1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Whisk tarragon, 1/2 bunch mint, yogurt, 1 tablespoon olive oil, garlic, cumin, and 1 teaspoon black pepper together in a bowl; pour marinade into a resealable plastic bag. Add lamb steaks, coat with marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator, 8 hours to overnight.
2. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate.
3. Whisk 1/4 cup olive oil, sherry vinegar, honey, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Add 2 tablespoons chopped mint and stir to combine vinaigrette.
4. Remove steaks from marinade and scrape off all herbs and garlic; discard marinade. Drizzle steaks with 1 tablespoon olive oil and season with salt and pepper.
5. Cook steaks on the preheated grill until browned on the outside and slightly pink in the center, about 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C). Transfer steaks to a plate, drizzle 1/2 of the vinaigrette over the steaks, cover the steaks with foil, and let rest for 10 minutes. Transfer steaks to individual plates and drizzle remaining vinaigrette over each.
