## Ingredients

- 1 cup butter, softened
- ½ cup white sugar
- ¾ cup packed brown sugar
- 2  eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 cup whole wheat flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 1 cup diced, pitted dates
- 3 cups rolled oats

## Instructions

1. Beat butter, white sugar, and brown sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Add eggs, one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into the butter mixture before adding the next. Beat in vanilla extract. Combine all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon in a separate bowl; stir into butter mixture. Fold in oats and dates. Cover and chill dough for at least one hour.
2. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease two baking sheets.
