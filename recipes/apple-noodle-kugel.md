## Ingredients

- 1 (8 ounce) package egg noodles
- 2 tablespoons butter, melted
- 3  Macintosh apples, sliced
- 3  eggs, separated
- 1 cup white sugar
- ¼ cup golden raisins
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Grease a 2-quart baking dish.
3. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain.
4. Stir melted butter and noodles in a large bowl.
5. Mix apples, egg yolks, sugar, raisins, cinnamon, and vanilla extract into noodle mixture until well blended.
6. Beat egg whites in a large bowl until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites should form a sharp peak that holds its shape.
7. Fold egg whites into noodle mixture; pour into prepared baking dish.
8. Bake in the preheated oven until browned, about 40 minutes.
