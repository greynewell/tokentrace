## Ingredients

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon cracked black pepper
- 1 teaspoon seasoned salt
- ¼ teaspoon garlic powder  (Optional)
- 1 pound beef cube steaks
- ½ cup olive oil
- 2 cups beef broth

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Mix the flour, black pepper, seasoned salt, and garlic powder together in a shallow bowl, and coat the cube steaks thoroughly with the flour mixture, patting the flour onto the steaks to get a good coating. Retain 3 tablespoons of seasoned flour.
3. Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat, and pan-fry the cube steaks until golden brown on both sides, about 5 minutes per side. Place the steaks into a 9x12-inch baking dish. Whisk the retained seasoned flour into the beef broth until smooth, and pour the broth over the steaks. Cover the dish with aluminum foil.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until the meat is tender and the gravy has thickened, about 2 hours.
