## Ingredients

- ½ cup honey
- 6 tablespoons soy sauce
- 3 tablespoons lemon juice
- 2 teaspoons minced garlic
- 6  pork chops

## Instructions

1. Whisk honey, soy sauce, lemon juice, and garlic together in a bowl until marinade is smooth. Pour marinade into a resealable plastic bag, reserving about 1/4 of the marinade in a bowl for basting. Add the pork chops to the bag, coat with the marinade, squeeze bag to remove excess air, and seal the bag; marinate in the refrigerator at least 5 hours.
2. Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove pork chops from the marinade, and shake off excess. Discard remaining marinade.
3. Grill pork chops on the preheated grill, basting with the reserved marinade during the last few minutes, until pork chops are cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Let pork chops rest for 3 minutes before serving.
