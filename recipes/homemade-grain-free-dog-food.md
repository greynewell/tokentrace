## Ingredients

- 4 medium carrots, peeled and chopped
- 2  apples - peeled, cored and chopped
- ¼ cup water
- 6  eggs
- 3 pounds ground chicken
- 6 ounces chicken livers, chopped
- 3 tablespoons sunflower seed oil
- 4 cups baby spinach leaves

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Place carrots, apples, and water into a pot. Bring to a boil; cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer until soft, 10 to 15 minutes.
3. Crack eggs and whisk together in a bowl; place eggshells onto a baking sheet.
