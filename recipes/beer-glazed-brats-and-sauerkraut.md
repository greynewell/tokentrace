## Ingredients

- ⅛ teaspoon celery seeds
- ⅛ teaspoon caraway seeds
- 1 pound fresh bratwurst sausages
- 1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle lager beer
- 1 tablespoon light brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons dry mustard powder
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- ⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ⅛ teaspoon dried dill weed
- 1 pound sauerkraut (preferably barrel-aged), drained

## Instructions

1. Crush celery seeds and caraway seeds in a mortar and pestle until ground; set aside.
2. Place bratwursts into a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Mix beer, brown sugar, dry mustard, onion powder, black pepper, dill weed, and crushed celery and caraway seeds in a bowl, stirring to dissolve brown sugar; pour over the brats. Bring to a boil and reduce heat to low; cover and simmer for 10 minutes.
3. Uncover and raise heat to medium; boil the sauce until it reduces to a thick, syrupy liquid, about 20 minutes. Tilt skillet to roll brats in the sticky sauce until thoroughly coated. Transfer sausage to a platter and keep warm. Cook and stir sauerkraut in the same skillet to mix in any leftover sauce, 5 to 8 minutes. Transfer sauerkraut to a serving platter and top with cooked bratwurst.
