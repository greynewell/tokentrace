## Instructions

1. Mix lemon juice, basil, 1 tablespoon onion powder, and salt in a large bowl; toss the shrimp, grouper, and tilapia in the marinade.
2. Remove fish fillets and allow shrimp to continue to marinate.
3. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over high heat and cook grouper and tilapia fillets just until outsides are white, about 3 minutes.
4. Remove fish with a slotted spoon.
5. Cook and stir shrimp in the same skillet until firm and white on the outside, 3 to 5 minutes, sprinkling shrimp with black pepper and 1 more tablespoon onion powder as they cook.
6. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large soup pot; cook and stir onion and garlic until onion is translucent and beginning to brown, about 8 minutes.
7. Transfer shrimp to the soup pot and mix in potatoes, carrots, zucchinis, sweet corn, and cilantro.
8. Stir in water to cover and bring soup to a boil; simmer over medium-low heat until potatoes and carrots are tender, about 30 minutes.
9. Stir in skim milk and coconut cream.
10. Gently mix in grouper and tilapia fillets, bring chowder to a boil, and reduce heat to low.
11. Simmer chowder until fish are no longer translucent and break apart into chunks, about 10 more minutes.
12. For a thicker chowder, scoop up about 1/2 cup of soup into a small bowl and whisk whole wheat flour into liquid until smooth.
13. Stir the flour mixture into chowder and let simmer until thickened, about 5 more minutes.
