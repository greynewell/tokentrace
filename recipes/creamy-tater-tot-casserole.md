## Ingredients

- 2 pounds tater tots, thawed
- 1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup
- 1 cup finely chopped onion
- 1 (16 ounce) container sour cream
- 1 (8 ounce) package sharp Cheddar cheese, shredded
- 1 dash garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon seasoning salt
- ½ cup butter, softened
- 3 cups cornflakes cereal
- ½ cup butter, melted
- 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
- paprika to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch casserole dish.
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine tater tots, sour cream, condensed soup, Cheddar cheese, onion, butter, seasoning salt, and garlic powder; mix well. Transfer to the prepared casserole dish.
3. In a medium bowl, combine cereal and melted butter; spread over casserole. Sprinkle the top with Parmesan cheese and paprika.
4. Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until browned. (Note: It's a good idea to put a cookie sheet under the casserole dish, in case it bubbles over while cooking.)
