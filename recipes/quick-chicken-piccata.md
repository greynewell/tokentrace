## Ingredients

- 4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- cayenne pepper, or to taste
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- all-purpose flour for dredging
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 tablespoon capers, drained
- ½ cup white wine
- ¼ cup fresh lemon juice
- ¼ cup water
- 3 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut in 1/4-inch slices
- 2 tablespoons fresh Italian parsley, chopped

## Instructions

1. Place chicken breasts between 2 sheets of heavy plastic on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken breasts with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a 1/2-inch thickness.
2. Season both sides of chicken breasts with cayenne, salt, and black pepper; dredge lightly in flour and shake off any excess.
3. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in the pan, reduce heat to medium, and cook until browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side; remove to a plate.
4. Cook capers in reserved oil, smashing them lightly to release brine, until warmed through, about 30 seconds.
5. Pour white wine into the skillet and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Cook until reduced by half, about 2 minutes.
6. Stir lemon juice, water, and butter into the reduced wine mixture; cook and stir continuously to form a thick sauce, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low and stir parsley through the sauce.
7. Return chicken breasts to the pan and cook until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve with sauce spooned over the top.
