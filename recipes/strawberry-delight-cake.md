## Ingredients

- 1 (16.5 ounce) package strawberry cake mix
- 1 cup water
- 3  large eggs
- ⅓ cup vegetable oil
- 1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
- 1 (16 ounce) package frozen sweetened strawberries, thawed but not drained
- 1 (12 ounce) container frozen whipped topping (such as Cool Whip®), thawed

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
2. Mix strawberry cake mix, water, eggs, and oil together in a bowl using an electric mixer on low speed. Increase speed to medium and mix batter for 2 minutes. Pour batter into the prepared baking dish.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the middle of the cake comes out clean, 24 to 27 minutes.
