## Ingredients

- 1 pound veal, scallopini cut
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- 1  egg
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
- 1 cup panko bread crumbs
- nonstick cooking spray
- 1  lemon, cut into wedges

## Instructions

1. Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Place veal on a clean work surface and sprinkle with lemon juice, salt, and pepper.
3. Place flour in a flat dish. Beat egg and parsley together in a second dish. Place bread crumbs in a third dish. Dredge each veal cutlet first in flour, then in egg-parsley mixture, followed by bread crumbs, pressing down so that bread crumbs adhere.
4. Spray the basket of the air fryer with nonstick cooking spray. Place breaded veal cutlets into the basket, making sure not to overcrowd. Spray the tops with nonstick cooking spray.
5. Cook for 5 minutes. Flip, spray any chalky spots with nonstick cooking spray, and cook for 5 minutes longer. Repeat with remaining veal. Serve with lemon wedges.
