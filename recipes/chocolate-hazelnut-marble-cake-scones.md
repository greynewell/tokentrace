## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- ¼ cup sugar
- 1 ½ teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- 6 tablespoons vegan butter
- ⅔ cup So Delicious® Dairy Free Hazelnut Coconut Milk Creamer
- ⅓ cup dark chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Sift together flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and baking soda in large bowl. Add vegan butter and mix together with hands until mixture forms large, coarse crumbs the size of peas. Add chocolate chips and creamer, mix for a few more seconds until just moistened. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and press together gently until the dough clings together in a ball. Pat into a circle about 2-inches thick and 6 inches in diameter.
2. Let sit for 15 minutes at room temperature. Cut into 8 wedges. Sprinkle with remaining tablespoon of sugar.
3. Bake for 15-20 minutes or until golden on top. Allow to cool for a few minutes, before separating wedges.
