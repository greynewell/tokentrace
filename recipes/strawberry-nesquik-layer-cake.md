## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups white sugar
- 1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
- ½ cup strawberry-flavored milk powder (such as Nesquik®)
- 4  eggs, separated, at room temperature
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 8 drops red food coloring, or as desired
- 3 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
- 3 teaspoons baking powder
- 2 pinches salt, divided
- 1 cup whole milk, at room temperature
- 2 cups cold heavy cream
- 2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar
- 1 (3.4 ounce) package instant vanilla-flavored pudding mix
- 2 tablespoons whole milk, or more as needed
- ¾ cup chopped fresh strawberries
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- ½ cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
- ½ cup shortening
- 1 (16 ounce) package confectioners' sugar

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round layer cake pans.
2. Cream sugar, butter, and strawberry powder together for cake until smooth and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add separated egg yolks 1 at a time, beating after each addition. Add vanilla extract and red food coloring. Beat until color is consistent.
3. Blend together flour, baking powder, and 1 pinch salt together in a separate bowl.
4. Add flour mixture to the creamed mixture in 3 batches, alternating with milk and blending after each addition. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl. Beat batter for 1 minute more.
5. Beat egg whites and remaining pinch of salt together in a separate bowl using a mixer with a whip attachment until stiff peaks form. Gently fold in whipped egg whites until smooth and consistent. Pour batter into the prepared cake pans.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the layers comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 15 to 30 minutes. Flip cakes out and invert onto the wire rack to cool to room temperature.
7. While the cake layers are cooling, combine cold heavy cream and confectioner's sugar in a clean mixing bowl. Whisk until cream begins to thicken and soft peaks form. Add pudding mix slowly while continuing to whisk; filling should be thick (almost dry) at this time. Add milk until mixture has a thick, smooth consistency. Fold in strawberries. Set filling aside.
8. Beat cream cheese, butter, and shortening together in a mixing bowl using an electric mixer until creamy. Scrape down the bowl and add confectioner's sugar. Blend until smooth. Set frosting aside.
9. Spread filling between the cooled cake layers. Frost the cake and decorate as desired.
