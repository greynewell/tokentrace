## Ingredients

- 2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- 2  egg whites
- 2  eggs
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- ¾ cup sliced almonds
- 1 cup sweetened-dried cranberries

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (170 degrees C).
2. Combine dry ingredients in a medium sized mixing bowl. Whisk together eggs, egg whites, and vanilla or almond extract in a separate mixing bowl.
3. Add egg mixture to dry ingredients, mixing just until moist, using an electric mixer on medium speed. Add dried cranberries and almonds; mix thoroughly.
4. On floured surface, divide batter in half and pat each half into a log approximately 14 inches long and 1 1/2 inches thick. Place on a cookie sheet and bake 30 minutes or until firm. Cool on a wire rack about 10 minutes, or until cool enough to handle.
5. Cut biscotti on the diagonal into 1/2-inch slices. Reduce oven temperature to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Place cut biscotti upright on a cookie sheet, spacing them about an inch apart, and bake for an additional 20 minutes. Let cool and store in a loosely covered container.
