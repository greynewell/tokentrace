## Ingredients

- 2  medium sweet potatoes
- ¼ cup olive oil, divided
- ½ teaspoon smoked paprika
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ⅛ teaspoon garlic powder
- ⅛ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper

## Instructions

1. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
2. Scrub sweet potatoes thoroughly under cold running water. Cut each potato lengthwise into 8 wedges. Place wedges in a bowl and toss with 2 tablespoons of oil. Combine remaining olive oil, paprika, salt, garlic powder, cinnamon, and cayenne in a separate small bowl.
