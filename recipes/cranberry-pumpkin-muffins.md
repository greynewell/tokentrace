## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- ¾ cup brown sugar, packed
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ¼ teaspoon ground ginger
- ⅛ teaspoon ground cloves
- ⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1 cup canned unsweetened pumpkin puree
- 2  eggs, lightly beaten
- ½ cup butter, melted
- ¼ cup buttermilk
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 cup dried, sweetened cranberries

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners.
2. Mix flour, brown sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, baking soda, ginger, cloves, and nutmeg together in a mixing bowl.
