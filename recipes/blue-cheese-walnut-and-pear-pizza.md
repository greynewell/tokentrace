## Ingredients

- 1  pre-baked pizza crust
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- 2 sprigs fresh rosemary, chopped
- ¼ cup white wine vinegar
- ½ cup olive oil
- ¼ cup crumbled blue cheese
- salt and pepper to taste
- ¼ cup crumbled blue cheese
- ⅓ cup shredded mozzarella cheese
- 2  pears - peeled, cored and sliced
- ¼ cup toasted walnut pieces

## Instructions

1. Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Place the pizza crust on a pizza pan. Bake in the preheated oven until just crisp, about 5 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, combine the garlic, Dijon mustard, rosemary, and vinegar in a food processor or blender. Turn on, and drizzle in the olive oil slowly until the dressing has thickened. Quickly pulse in 1/4 cup of blue cheese; season to taste with salt and pepper.
4. Spread the vinaigrette over the pizza crust. Sprinkle 1/4 cup of blue cheese evenly over the crust, followed by the mozzarella cheese. Arrange the sliced pears over the cheese, and sprinkle with the toasted walnuts.
