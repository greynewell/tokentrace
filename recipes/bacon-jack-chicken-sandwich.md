## Ingredients

- 8 slices bacon
- 4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- 2 teaspoons poultry seasoning
- 4 slices pepperjack cheese
- 4  hamburger buns, split
- 4  leaves of lettuce
- 4 slices tomato
- ½ cup thinly sliced onions

## Instructions

1. Preheat a grill for medium heat.
2. While the grill preheats, place the bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook until browned on both sides. Remove from the pan, and drain on paper towels.
