## Ingredients

- 1 pound ground meatloaf mix (beef, pork veal)
- 4 slices white bread
- ⅓ cup milk
- 1  egg, beaten
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon freshly grated nutmeg
- ½ teaspoon ground cloves
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ½ cup butter
- 2 cups water
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
- 1 (14 ounce) can beef broth
- 1 (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix

## Instructions

1. Place meatloaf mix in a large mixing bowl; crumble bread over meat and knead with hands to combine. Add milk and egg to meat mixture. Knead onion, nutmeg, cloves, salt, and pepper into meat mixture until well-combined. Form mixture into six equal-sized balls.
2. Melt butter in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Cook and stir meatballs in hot butter until browned on all sides, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir water, tomatoes, beef broth, and onion soup mix into Dutch oven; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until meatballs are tender and cooked through, about 1 hour.
