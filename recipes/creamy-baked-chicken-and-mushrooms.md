## Ingredients

- 3  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or more to taste
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 medium white onion, chopped
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
- 1 teaspoon poultry seasoning
- ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1 (7 ounce) can whole mushrooms, drained
- 1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup
- 1 cup heavy cream
- ¼ cup buttermilk
- 4 slices Swiss cheese

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Season chicken breasts with salt and pepper.
2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and cook until semi-transparent, about 5 minutes. Add parsley and stir until coated. Place chicken in the skillet and cook until browned, about 5 minutes per side. Remove the skillet from heat.
3. Sprinkle poultry seasoning and cayenne over chicken to coat. Transfer chicken to a 9x13-inch baking dish. Cover with mushrooms and set aside on a warming plate.
4. Combine condensed soup, heavy cream, and buttermilk in a mixing bowl. Stir in onion mixture until combined. Pour over chicken. Cover the tops with Swiss cheese, making sure all areas are covered.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour and 35 minutes. Remove from the oven and let stand for 15 minutes.
