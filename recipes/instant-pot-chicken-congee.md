## Ingredients

- 1 cup uncooked short-grain white rice
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 14 ounces boneless, skinless chicken breast
- 6 cups chicken broth
- 1 (2 inch) piece grated fresh ginger
- 1 ear fresh corn, husked
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 3  spring onions, sliced
- 6 teaspoons black sesame seeds
- 6 teaspoons spicy chili crisp sauce

## Instructions

1. Rinse rice under cold running water until the water runs clear. Set aside.
2. Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and select Saute function. Heat oil and brown chicken on all sides, about 8 minutes, making sure each side is browned before flipping. Add a few tablespoons of chicken broth to the Instant Pot® and scrape off any browned bits from the bottom with a wooden spatula. Turn off Saute function. Add drained rice, ginger, and remaining broth.
3. Cut the kernels from the corn cob and break cob into 3 pieces. Add corn kernels and cob pieces to the pot. Close and seal the lid. Select Porridge function and set timer for 30 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
4. Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 15 minutes. Open the lid and discard the corn cob pieces. Remove chicken breast. Shred chicken with two forks and return to the congee. Season with salt and pepper and mix well.
5. Divide congee amongst 6 bowls. Top each bowl with equal amounts of sliced spring onions, sesame seeds, and chili crisp.
