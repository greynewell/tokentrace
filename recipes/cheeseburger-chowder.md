## Ingredients

- 2 pounds ground beef
- 2 (15 ounce) cans diced new potatoes
- 1 cup chopped onion
- 4 cups milk
- 1 pound processed cheese food (such as Velveeta ®), cut into chunks
- ½ pound sharp Cheddar cheese, cut into chunks
- ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Heat a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Add diced potatoes and onion; cook and stir until onion is tender, 5 to 10 minutes.
