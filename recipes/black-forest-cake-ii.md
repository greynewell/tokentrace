## Ingredients

- 1 ⅔ cups all-purpose flour
- ⅔ cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 ½ teaspoons baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ cup shortening
- 1 ½ cups white sugar
- 2  eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 ½ cups buttermilk
- ½ cup kirschwasser
- ½ cup butter
- 3 ½ cups confectioners' sugar
- 1 pinch salt
- 1 teaspoon strong brewed coffee
- 2 (14 ounce) cans pitted Bing cherries, drained
- 2 cups heavy whipping cream
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 tablespoon kirschwasser
- 1 (1 ounce) square semisweet chocolate

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line the bottoms of two 8 inch round pans with parchment paper circles. Sift together flour, cocoa, baking soda and 1 teaspoon salt. Set aside.
2. Cream shortening and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs and vanilla. Beat in flour mixture, alternating with buttermilk, until combined. Pour into 2 round 8 inch pans.
3. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 35 to 40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean. Cool completely. Remove paper from the cakes. Cut each layer in half, horizontally, making 4 layers total. Sprinkle layers with the 1/2 cup kirshwasser.
4. In a medium bowl, cream the butter until light and fluffy. Add confectioners sugar, pinch of salt, and coffee; beat until smooth. If the consistency is too thick, add a couple teaspoons of cherry juice or milk. Spread first layer of cake with 1/3 of the filling. Top with 1/3 of the cherries. Repeat with the remaining layers.
5. In a separate bowl, whip the cream to stiff peaks. Beat in 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and 1 tablespoon kirshwasser. Frost top and sides of cake. Sprinkle with chocolate curls made by using a potato peeler on semisweet baking chocolate.
