## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons instant mashed potato flakes
- 3 tablespoons white sugar
- 1 cup warm water
- 2 ¼ teaspoons active dry yeast

## Instructions

1. Combine instant potatoes, sugar, water, and yeast in a covered container. Let the starter sit on a counter for 5 days, stirring daily with a wooden spoon.
2. On the morning of the fifth day, feed the starter with 3 tablespoons instant potatoes, 3 tablespoons sugar, and 1 cup warm water. In the evening, take out 1 cup of the starter to use in a sourdough recipe. Refrigerate the remaining starter.
