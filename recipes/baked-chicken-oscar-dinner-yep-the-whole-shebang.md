## Ingredients

- 6  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- 12 small red potatoes
- 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- 2 teaspoons sea salt
- 2 teaspoons garlic powder  (Optional)
- 2 teaspoons lemon and herb seasoning
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 6 slices Havarti cheese, folded in half
- 3 (.9 ounce) packages hollandaise sauce mix (such as Knorr®)
- 3 cups milk
- ¾ cup butter
- 1 teaspoon ground white pepper
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- 1 pinch garlic powder  (Optional)
- 1 pound fresh asparagus, trimmed
- 1 (8 ounce) package imitation crabmeat, chopped
- ¼ teaspoon paprika

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Make chicken and potatoes: Place chicken breasts into a 9x13-inch baking dish and red potatoes into a separate 8-inch square baking dish. Drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil over chicken breasts and 1 tablespoon oil over potatoes.
3. Combine sea salt, garlic powder, lemon and herb seasoning, onion powder, basil, and black pepper in a small bowl. Sprinkle chicken and potatoes each with 1/2 of the seasoning mix and cover both baking dishes with aluminum foil.
4. Bake chicken and potatoes alongside each other in the preheated oven for 40 to 45 minutes. Remove chicken and top each breast with folded slice of Havarti cheese. Return chicken to the oven and bake until Havarti cheese is melted, chicken is no longer pink inside, and juices run clear, about 5 more minutes.
5. Remove chicken and potatoes from the oven and allow to rest, still covered, for 5 minutes.
6. Make Hollandaise sauce: Whisk sauce mix with milk in a saucepan over medium heat; bring to a boil and stir in butter until melted. Reduce the heat to low and simmer until thickened, about 1 minute. Remove from the heat and stir in white pepper, basil, and garlic powder.
7. Place asparagus in a large skillet. Pour in 1 inch water, turn the heat to medium, and bring to a boil. Cover and steam until asparagus is just tender but still bright green, 2 to 4 minutes.
8. To serve, place each chicken breast onto a serving plate and top with imitation crab meat. Pour about 2 tablespoons of Hollandaise sauce over each serving and place several spears of asparagus on top; drizzle 2 more tablespoons of sauce over each portion. Serve remaining sauce on the side. Garnish with pinch of paprika and serve with 2 red potatoes on each serving plate.
