## Ingredients

- 1 pound bone-in goat meat, cut into large chunks
- ¼ cup vinegar
- ¼ cup soy sauce
- 4 cloves garlic, crushed
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1  onion, chopped
- 1  red bell pepper, cut into 1-inch squares
- 1 cup tomato sauce
- 2 cups beef stock
- 1  potato, peeled and cut into large chunks
- 2  carrots, peeled and cut into large chunks
- ½ cup green peas
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon pepper
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper

## Instructions

1. Mix goat meat with vinegar, soy sauce, and garlic in a large bowl; cover and refrigerate for 1 to 8 hours. For the best flavor, marinate at least 6 hours. Remove meat from marinade and pat dry with paper towels; reserve marinade and garlic cloves.
2. Heat vegetable oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Working in batches, cook goat meat in hot oil until browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer goat meat to a plate and set aside.
3. Cook and stir onion, red bell pepper, and garlic cloves from marinade in drippings in the pot over medium heat until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Pour in tomato sauce; bring to a simmer. Cook until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes.
4. Return goat meat to sauce. Pour in reserved marinade and beef stock; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover the pot, and simmer until meat is partially tender, 30 to 40 minutes.
5. Stir in potato, carrots, and peas; season with salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Simmer until goat meat is very tender and potato and carrots are cooked through, 20 to 30 more minutes. Adjust seasonings before serving.
