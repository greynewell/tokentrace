## Ingredients

- 1  all-beef hot dog
- 1  poppyseed hot dog bun
- 1 tablespoon yellow mustard
- 1 tablespoon sweet green pickle relish
- 1 tablespoon chopped onion
- 4  tomato wedges
- 1  dill pickle spear
- 2  sport peppers

## Instructions

1. Bring a pot of water to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low, place hot dog in water, and cook until warmed through, about 5 minutes. Remove hot dog from water and set aside.
2. Place a steamer basket into the pot and steam poppy seed bun until warm, about 2 minutes.
3. Place hot dog in steamed bun. Pile on toppings in this order: mustard, relish, onion, tomato, pickle, peppers, and celery salt.
