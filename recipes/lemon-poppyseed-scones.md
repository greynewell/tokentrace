## Ingredients

- 2 cups oat flour
- 1 ¼ cups whole wheat pastry flour
- 1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
- 4 teaspoons baking powder
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- ½ cup white sugar
- ½ cup shortening
- ½ cup butter
- 1 tablespoon grated lemon zest
- 2 tablespoons poppy seeds
- ⅔ cup buttermilk
- 1 tablespoon melted butter

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. In a large bowl, stir together the oat flour, whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Cut in shortening and 1/2 cup of butter until the lumps are smaller than peas. Stir in the lemon zest and poppy seeds. Make a well in the center and pour in the buttermilk. Stir just until the dry ingredients are moistened.
3. Divide the dough into 2 pieces. Pat each one into a 1 inch thick circle. Cut circles into 6 wedges like a pie. Place pieces onto a baking sheet, and brush the tops with melted butter.
4. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until lightly browned. Cool on a wire rack so they do not get too crumbly.
