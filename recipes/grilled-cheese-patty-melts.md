## Ingredients

- 1 pound 85% lean ground beef
- 3 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
- 1 tablespoon finely chopped garlic
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1 teaspoon Montreal-style steak seasoning
- 6 slices white bread
- 6 slices Colby-Jack cheese

## Instructions

1. Combine ground beef, parsley, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, and steak seasoning in a bowl; mix until thoroughly combined. Form into 3 evenly-sized patties.
2. Warm a nonstick griddle over medium heat. Place burgers onto the warm griddle and cook to desired doneness, 4 to 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (71 degrees C). Remove burgers and set aside.
3. Warm a second griddle over medium heat. Butter 1 side of each bread slice. Place a slice of bread onto the griddle, butter-side down. Add a slice of cheese, a burger, and a second slice of cheese. Top with another slice of bread, butter-side up. Repeat with remaining burgers.
4. Cook until bread is golden brown on the bottom, 3 to 5 minutes. Flip and cook until the other side is golden brown and cheese is melted, 3 to 5 minutes more.
