## Ingredients

- 1 (1 1/2 inch) piece fresh turmeric root, peeled and grated
- 1 (1/2 inch) piece fresh ginger root, peeled and grated
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 1 cup unsweetened almond milk
- 1 pinch ground turmeric  (Optional)
- 1 pinch ground cinnamon  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Combine turmeric root, ginger root, and honey together in a bowl, crushing the turmeric and ginger as much as possible.
2. Heat almond milk in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Once small bubbles begin to form around the edges, reduce heat to low. Transfer about 2 tablespoon milk to turmeric mixture to allow mixture to soften and honey to melt into a paste-like mixture.
3. Mix the turmeric paste into milk in the saucepan; raise temperature to medium-low and cook, stirring continuously, until fully combined. Blend with an immersion blender for a smooth texture.
4. Pour turmeric tea into a mug and top with ground turmeric and cinnamon.
