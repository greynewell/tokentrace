## Ingredients

- ¼ cup butter
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- ½ cup chopped onion
- ½ cup chopped celery
- ½ cup chopped baby carrots
- ½ cup all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons white sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 4 cups chicken broth
- 1 (10 ounce) can peas, drained
- 4 cups diced, cooked chicken meat
- 2 cups buttermilk baking mix
- 2 teaspoons dried basil
- ⅔ cup milk

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
2. In a skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Cook and stir the garlic, onion, celery, and carrots in butter until tender. Mix in the flour, sugar, salt, 1 teaspoon dried basil, and pepper. Stir in broth, and bring to a boil. Stirring constantly, boil 1 minute, reduce heat, and stir in peas. Simmer 5 minutes, then mix in chicken. Transfer mixture to the prepared baking dish.
3. In a medium bowl, combine the baking mix and 2 teaspoons dried basil. Stir in milk to form a dough. Divide the dough into 6 to 8 balls. On floured wax paper, use the palm of your hand to flatten each ball of dough into a circular shape; place on top of chicken mixture.
4. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Cover with foil, and bake for 10 more minutes. To serve, spoon chicken mixture over biscuits.
