## Ingredients

- 1 loaf French bread
- 4 tablespoons margarine
- 8 ounces sliced deli turkey meat
- 8 slices provolone cheese
- 8 slices precooked bacon
- 4 tablespoons mayonnaise
- 4 tablespoons jellied cranberry sauce
- 8 slices fresh tomatoes
- 4  lettuce leaves

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven broiler.
2. Cut the bread into four pieces, and split lengthwise almost all the way through for four sandwiches. Spread margarine on the inside of each piece. Place on a baking sheet, cut side up.
3. Toast bread under preheated broiler until lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove pan from the oven.
4. Layer 4 pieces of bread with 2 slices each of the turkey, cheese, and bacon. Remove the remaining 4 slices of bread from the baking sheet and reserve for sandwich tops. Cool bread slightly, and spread mayonnaise onto the cut side of each of the 4 top slices.
5. Place the bread with turkey and cheese under the broiler just until the cheese melts, about 1 minute. Remove from the broiler, and spread 1 tablespoon cranberry sauce over each sandwich. Layer with the tomatoes and lettuce. Place a top bread slice over each half, and serve.
