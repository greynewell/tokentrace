## Ingredients

- 3 ½ cups fresh strawberries, hulled, divided
- 7 tablespoons white sugar, divided
- 2  lemon, juiced, divided
- 2 tablespoons water, or as needed  (Optional)
- 2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
- 1 cup heavy whipping cream
- ½ (12 ounce) package ladyfinger cookies, or more as needed

## Instructions

1. Reserve 3 or 4 strawberries for the garnish. Slice 1/2 of the remaining strawberries and place in a bowl with 2 tablespoons sugar and the juice of 1 lemon. Stir to combine and set aside.
2. Transfer remaining strawberries into a blender. Add 2 1/2 tablespoons sugar and remaining lemon juice. Blend until smooth.
3. Transfer strawberry puree to a small saucepan. Cook over low heat, stirring often, until thickened to a sauce-like consistency, 5 to 10 minutes. Taste and add more sugar if strawberry sauce is not sweet enough. Add some water if sauce is too thick. Remove from heat and let cool completely.
4. Combine cream cheese and 2 1/2 tablespoons sugar in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Whip cream in a separate bowl until soft peaks form. Fold into the cream cheese mixture.
5. Arrange ladyfingers snugly in a single layer inside a square glass dish. Pour 1/2 of the strawberry sauce over the ladyfingers. Spread 1/2 of the cream cheese mixture on top. Scatter 1/2 of the marinated sliced strawberries onto the cream cheese mixture. Repeat layers with remaining ladyfingers, sauce, and sliced strawberries. Spread the remaining cream mixture evenly over the top; garnish with the reserved strawberries.
6. Cover tiramisu with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 4 hours to overnight.
