## Ingredients

- 2 cups sifted cake flour
- 1 ½ cups white sugar
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ cup vegetable oil
- 7  egg yolks
- ¾ cup cold water
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon lemon extract
- 7  egg whites
- ½ teaspoon cream of tartar
- 1 recipe Williamsburg Butter Frosting

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Wash a 10-inch angel food tube pan in hot soapy water to ensure it is grease-free; dry well.
2. Measure flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt into a sifter; sift into a bowl. Make a well; add egg yolks, water, oil, vanilla extract, and lemon extract to the well in the order listed. Do not beat.
3. Beat egg whites and cream of tartar in a large bowl until very stiff.
4. Using the same beaters, beat egg yolk batter until smooth and light; pour slowly over egg whites. Gently fold mixtures together with a rubber spatula; do not stir. Pour batter into the angel food tube pan.
5. Bake cake in the preheated oven for 55 minutes. Increase heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue baking until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 10 to 15 more minutes.
6. Invert the pan onto a wire rack. Let cool completely before unmolding and frosting as desired.
