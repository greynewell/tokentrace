## Ingredients

- 1 ½ pounds boneless pork chops
- 1 pint water to cover
- 1  lime, juiced
- 1 sprig fresh thyme
- 8  black peppercorns
- 1 tablespoon garlic powder, or to taste
- 1 tablespoon onion powder
- salt to taste
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 large onion, halved and thinly sliced
- 3 cloves garlic, peeled and sliced
- 1  lime, juiced
- ¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro

## Instructions

1. Combine water, juice of one lime, thyme sprig, peppercorns, garlic powder, onion powder, and salt in a large pot; bring to a boil. Add pork chops, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until meat is very tender, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Add more water as necessary to keep chops covered.
2. Turn off heat and let chops rest in broth for 30 minutes. Remove chops from broth and shred, removing excess fat; set aside.
3. Heat olive oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Add shredded pork and fry until almost crisp, about 5 minutes. Add onion and garlic; continue to cook until onion is just tender yet slightly crisp, about 10 minutes more.
4. Stir in juice of one lime and cilantro; serve.
