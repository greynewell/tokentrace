## Ingredients

- 1 large cushaw squash - peeled, seeded, and chopped
- 3 cups heavy whipping cream
- 1 ½ cups clover honey
- 4  eggs
- ¼ cup molasses
- 5 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 1 tablespoon ground ginger
- 2 teaspoons salt, divided
- ¼ teaspoon ground allspice
- ¼ teaspoon nutmeg
- 2 cups hard white flour, or more as needed
- 12 ⅔ tablespoons butter, softened
- 7 tablespoons ice-cold water

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add squash, cover, and steam until very tender, 15 to 20 minutes.
3. Blend squash in a blender until smooth. Pour 6 cups of squash puree into a large mixing bowl. Reserve any extra squash puree for a separate use.
4. Add cream, honey, eggs, molasses, cinnamon, ginger, 1 teaspoon salt, allspice, and nutmeg into the mixing bowl with squash puree; whisk until smooth. Cover and set aside.
5. Mix flour and 1 teaspoon salt together in a bowl. Cut butter into flour mixture; add water and mix well. Add more flour to dough if it is too wet. Cut dough in half and roll onto a floured work surface; form into two 10-inch circles. Press dough into two 10-inch pie pans; pour squash filling into each.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes. Cool slightly before serving.
