## Ingredients

- 2 (2 pound) beef chuck roast, cut into 1/2-inch thick strips
- ½ cup red wine
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 large onion, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 cup sliced mushrooms
- ¼ cup butter
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- 1 ⅓ cups beef stock
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1 teaspoon prepared yellow mustard
- 2 teaspoons crushed red pepper flakes
- ⅓ cup sour cream
- 1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, softened

## Instructions

1. Place beef into a large bowl. Stir in red wine, salt, and black pepper. Marinate for 10 minutes, then remove beef and pat dry with a paper towel. Reserve remaining marinade.
2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in beef; cook and stir until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer beef to a plate, then drain any remaining grease from the skillet.
3. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in the skillet over medium heat. Stir in onion, garlic, and a pinch of salt. Cook and stir until onion is soft and translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer onion mixture to the plate with beef; set aside.
4. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in the skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms; cook and stir until tender, about 10 minutes. Transfer mushrooms to a bowl; set aside.
5. Melt 1/4 cup butter in the skillet over medium heat. Whisk in flour; cook and stir until flour no longer tastes raw, about 4 minutes. Slowly whisk in beef stock. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly, then reduce heat to medium-low.
6. Pour in reserved marinade, Worcestershire sauce, red pepper flakes, and mustard, then add beef and onion mixture. Cover and simmer until meat is tender, about 1 hour. Season with salt and black pepper.
7. Stir in mushrooms, cream cheese, and sour cream about 5 minutes before serving.
