## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 6  tilapia fillets
- 1 cup garlic- and herb-seasoned bread crumbs
- 2 teaspoons garlic and herb seasoning (such as McCormick®)
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 2 tablespoons milk
- 1 large egg

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a shallow baking dish with cooking spray. Pat fish fillets dry.
2. Mix bread crumbs, seasoning, salt, and cayenne pepper together in a zip-top bag. Seal the bag and toss ingredients together in the sealed bag until thoroughly mixed.
