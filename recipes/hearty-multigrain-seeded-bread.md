## Ingredients

- 1 cup warm water
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
- 2 cups bread flour
- 1 cup whole wheat flour
- ¼ cup coconut oil
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon chia seeds
- 1 tablespoon wheat germ
- 1 tablespoon flax seeds
- 1 tablespoon millet
- 2 tablespoons hulled hemp seeds, divided
- 2 tablespoons salted roasted sunflower seeds, divided
- 2 tablespoons old-fashioned oats, divided

## Instructions

1. Mix warm water and sugar together in a bowl until sugar is dissolved; stir in yeast. Set aside until a creamy foam starts to form, about 5 minutes.
2. Combine bread flour, whole wheat flour, coconut oil, and salt in a food processor; pulse 4 times. Add chia seeds, wheat germ, flax seeds, millet, 1 tablespoon hemp seeds, 1 tablespoon sunflower seeds, and 1 tablespoon oats; pulse until incorporated.
3. Pour yeast mixture over flour mixture in the food processor; process until a dough ball forms, about 1 minute.
4. Turn dough into a well-oiled large bowl and cover with a damp towel; allow to rise in a warm area until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
5. Punch dough down and knead a few times. Form dough into an oblong shape and place in a greased bread pan. Lightly press the remaining hemp seeds, sunflower seeds, and oats onto the loaf. Cover with a damp towel and let rise in a warm area for 30 minutes.
6. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
7. Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through and crust is lightly browned, about 30 minutes. Cool bread in the pan for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
