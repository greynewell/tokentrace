## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 (3.4 ounce) package instant butterscotch pudding mix
- 2 teaspoons baking soda
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon ground ginger
- ½ teaspoon ground allspice
- ¼ teaspoon ground cloves
- ⅓ cup finely chopped crystallized ginger
- 1 cup butter, room temperature
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 cup packed brown sugar
- 4  eggs, room temperature
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 24 muffin cups or line with paper liners.
2. Whisk together flour, pudding mix, crystallized ginger, cinnamon, baking soda, ground ginger, allspice, cloves, and salt in a bowl; set aside.
