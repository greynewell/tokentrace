## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 6 tablespoons butter, softened
- 1 ¼ cups white sugar
- 2 large eggs
- ½ cup milk
- 1 pint fresh blueberries
- 2 teaspoons white sugar
- 1 pinch ground cinnamon

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners.
2. Sift flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl.
