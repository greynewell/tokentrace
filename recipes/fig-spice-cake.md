- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 inch tube pan. Place the stewed figs into a saucepan, cover with water, and simmer on low heat for about 5 minutes. Drain and cool, reserving 1/2 cup of the liquid.
