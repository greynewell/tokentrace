## Ingredients

- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 ½ cups white sugar
- 1 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 2 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- cooking spray
- 1 cup creamy peanut butter
- 1 cup confectioners' sugar
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, softened
- 36  chocolate kiss candies, unwrapped

## Instructions

1. Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl.
2. Beat sugar and butter together in a separate bowl using a mixer at low speed. Increase speed to high and beat until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Reduce speed to low and beat in eggs, one at a time, and vanilla extract. Beat in flour until just blended and press together by hand into a dough. Divide dough into 4 equal portions and flatten each into a disk. Wrap disks individually in plastic and refrigerate 8 hours to overnight.
3. Remove 2 disks of dough from the refrigerator; keep remaining dough in the refrigerator or freezer for future use.
4. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray 36 mini muffin cups with cooking spray or line with paper liners.
5. Roll 1 rounded teaspoon of dough into a ball and press into the bottom and up the sides of a mini muffin cup to form a shell. Repeat with remaining dough to make 36 shells.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden, 12 to 15 minutes.
7. Meanwhile, beat peanut butter, confectioners' sugar, and butter together in a bowl using an electric mixer until creamy. Pour filling into a pastry bag or a resealable plastic bag with a corner snipped off.
8. Remove from the oven and press the end of a wooden spoon into each cookie cup to reshape. Cool 2 minutes in the pan, then carefully transfer to a rack to cool completely.
9. Fill each cooled cookie cup with about 1 tablespoons filling. Top each with 1 chocolate kiss candy.
