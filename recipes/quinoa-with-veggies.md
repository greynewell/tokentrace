## Ingredients

- 1 cup quinoa
- 3 cups water
- 1 pinch salt
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1  red bell pepper, chopped
- ½ cup corn kernels
- ½ teaspoon cumin
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- salt and pepper to taste
- 2  green onions, chopped

## Instructions

1. Bring the quinoa, water, and 1 pinch of salt to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the quinoa is tender, about 20 minutes. Once done, drain a mesh strainer, and set aside.
2. Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the garlic, and cook until the garlic softens and the aroma mellows, about 2 minutes. Add the red pepper, and corn; continue cooking until the pepper softens, about 5 minutes. Season with cumin, oregano, salt, and pepper, and cook for 1 minute more, then stir in the cooked quinoa and green onions. Serve hot or cold.
