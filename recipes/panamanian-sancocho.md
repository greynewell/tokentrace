## Ingredients

- 9 cups water
- 1  whole chicken
- 2  plantains, peeled and cut into 2-inch pieces
- 1  onion, chopped
- ½ cup chopped fresh cilantro
- 5 cloves garlic, chopped
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt
- 3 pounds yuca (cassava) roots, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes
- 6 small red potatoes, quartered
- 1 (15.25 ounce) can corn, drained

## Instructions

1. Combine water, chicken, plantains, onion, cilantro, garlic, and salt in a large pot. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium; cook until chicken is longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
2. Remove the chicken and let cool. Add yuca, potatoes, and corn to the soup; cook over medium heat until yuca and potatoes are softened, about 30 minutes.
3. Discard chicken skin and bones. Place meat back into the soup; stir to combine.
