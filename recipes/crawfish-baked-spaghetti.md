## Ingredients

- 1 ½ pounds crawfish, shell-on
- 1 (12 ounce) package spaghetti
- 1 teaspoon oil, or as needed
- 1 (10 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
- 1 (10 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup
- 1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
- 1 (14 ounce) can diced tomatoes, drained
- 1 teaspoon dried parsley flakes

## Instructions

1. Bring a pot of water to a boil; add crawfish and boil until they turn bright red and claws are easily pulled off, 7 to 10 minutes. Peel and devein crawfish to yield about 1 pound.
2. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil in the meantime. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.
3. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat an 8x10-inch baking dish lightly with oil.
4. Whisk cream of mushroom and chicken soups together in a medium saucepan with Cajun seasoning and garlic powder. Add 1 cup Cheddar cheese and continue whisking until cheese is melted and sauce is smooth and creamy.
5. Mix spaghetti, tomatoes, and crawfish together in the prepared baking dish. Add the cheese sauce and mix thoroughly. Sprinkle top remaining Cheddar cheese and parsley.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and golden brown at the edges, about 35 minutes.
