## Ingredients

- 12 medium jalapeno peppers
- 12 tablespoons cream cheese, softened
- 1 ½ pounds Beef, brisket, flat half, separable lean only, trimmed to 0" fat, all grades, cooked, braised
- 12 slices thick-cut bacon
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt, or as needed
- 1 teaspoon coarse ground black pepper
- ½ (12 ounce) bottle BBQ sauce

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
2. Slice jalapeños in the shape of a "T." Cut a straight vertical line from top to bottom with a crosscut directly under the stem, making sure to cut only halfway through the jalapeños. Use a spoon to remove and discard all seeds and membranes. Place jalapeños on a baking sheet.
3. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes.
4. Transfer jalapeños to a bowl of ice water for a few minutes to extract the rest of the seeds' oil. Blot dry with a paper towel.
5. Increase oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
6. Spread 1 tablespoon cream cheese inside each jalapeño. Place about 2 ounces brisket inside each, then wrap with a slice of bacon. Place poppers on a baking sheet and season with salt and pepper.
7. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and brush the tops with BBQ sauce. Return to the oven and bake 5 more minutes.
