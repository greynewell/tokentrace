## Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon olive oil
- ½ pound lean ground beef
- ½ cup canned crushed tomatoes, drained
- ¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ¼ teaspoon ground cumin
- ⅛ teaspoon paprika
- ⅛ teaspoon ground allspice
- 1 (16 ounce) package phyllo dough
- cooking oil spray

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.
2. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook ground beef until it loses its pink color and begins to brown; drain fat from skillet. Add tomatoes, cinnamon, cumin, paprika, and allspice. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until mixture reduces slightly, about 10 minutes.
3. Remove one phyllo sheet from the package and keep the rest covered with a clean cloth until ready to use. On a flat work surface, cut phyllo sheet into two 14x9-inch rectangles; spray one rectangle with cooking spray, place the other rectangle on top and spray again with oil. Place a generous teaspoon of meat filling near the narrow end of dough. Fold dough over meat, fold in the sides of dough, and roll into a cigar-shaped tube. Repeat until meat filling has been rolled up. Arrange phyllo cigars on the prepared baking sheet.
4. Bake in preheated oven until lightly browned, about 25 minutes.
