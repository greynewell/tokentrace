## Ingredients

- ½ stick butter, softened
- ½ clove minced garlic
- ¼ teaspoon dried thyme
- ¼ teaspoon dried basil
- ⅛ teaspoon coarse salt
- freshly ground black pepper
- ⅓ pound thick-cut bacon
- 1 ½ pounds boneless skinless chicken thighs
- 2 teaspoons minced garlic

## Instructions

1. Combine softened butter, 1/2 clove minced garlic, thyme, basil, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Place butter on a piece of wax paper and roll up rightly to form a butter log. Refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours.
2. Lay a bacon strip flat on a piece of wax paper. Place a chicken thigh on top of bacon and sprinkle with some of remaining minced garlic. Open up chicken thigh. Place 1 to 2 teaspoons of cold butter mixture in the middle of chicken thigh. Tuck one end of bacon into the middle of chicken thigh. Fold over chicken thigh and roll bacon around thigh. Repeat with remaining thighs and bacon.
3. Preheat an air fryer to 370 degrees F (190 degrees C).
4. Place chicken thighs in the basket of the air fryer and cook until chicken is no longer pink and the juices run clear, about 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted in the center of thighs should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
