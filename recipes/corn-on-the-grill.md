## Ingredients

- 5 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste
- ½ cup butter
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½  lime, juiced
- 2 tablespoons hot pepper sauce (such as Tapatio®)

## Instructions

1. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate.
