## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
- 1 tablespoon onion powder
- 1 tablespoon garlic powder
- 4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded to 1/4 inch thickness
- 4 tablespoons garlic flavored cream cheese spread
- ¼ cup garlic and herb seasoned dry bread crumbs
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. In a cup or small bowl, stir together the Italian seasoning, onion powder and garlic powder. Sprinkle over both sides of the chicken. Place 1 tablespoon of cream cheese on the center of each piece, and spread slightly. Tuck in the sides, and roll up tightly. Secure with toothpicks.

4. Heat the butter and oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Brown the chicken rolls on all sides, this should take about 5 minutes. Transfer the rolls to a baking dish.
