## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- ¾ cup chopped walnuts
- ¾ cup self-rising flour
- ¼ cup cocoa powder
- 3 tablespoons finely ground dark roast coffee beans
- ¾ cup unsalted butter
- 3 ounces unsweetened chocolate
- 1 ½ cups white sugar
- 2 large eggs, lightly beaten
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray an 8x8-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Line the pan with aluminum foil; spray foil with cooking spray.
2. Place walnuts on a baking sheet.
3. Toast walnuts in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 6 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool. Leave oven on.
4. Sift flour and cocoa powder together in a bowl. Stir in coffee. Set aside.
5. Fill a saucepan 1/3 of the way full with water and bring to a simmer over medium-low heat. Place butter and chocolate in a large heat-proof bowl and set the bowl over the simmering water. Reduce heat to low and stir chocolate mixture frequently until completely smooth, 3 to 4 minutes.
6. Remove bowl from heat and stir in sugar. Whisk in eggs and vanilla extract. Stir in flour mixture just until absorbed; stir in toasted walnuts. Pour batter evenly into the prepared baking dish.
7. Bake in the preheated oven until a crust forms on top and center is still slightly gooey, 30 to 35 minutes.
8. Remove from the oven and set the pan on a wire rack to cool to completely, about 30 minutes. Refrigerate 2 hours to overnight; cut into squares.
