## Ingredients

- ⅔ cup whole-milk ricotta cheese
- 2 large eggs, beaten
- 4 cups homemade dry bread crumbs
- 1 cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese
- ⅓ cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
- 1 clove garlic, crushed
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 (14 ounce) cans crushed tomatoes
- ¼ cup red wine
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
- 2 teaspoons white sugar
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper

## Instructions

1. Line a baking sheet or large plate with waxed paper.
2. Combine ricotta cheese and eggs in a large bowl; mix well. Add bread crumbs, Pecorino Romano cheese, Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, garlic, parsley, salt, and pepper; mix until thoroughly blended.
3. Take a scoop of the mixture with a small cookie scoop and put it in the palm of your hands. Roll it into a ball and place on the waxed paper. Repeat until all of the mixture has been shaped into balls. Place in the refrigerator while you make the sauce.
4. Heat olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add tomatoes, wine, basil, sugar, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to a simmer.
5. Add ricotta balls to the sauce. Simmer, shaking the pan occasionally to cover the balls with sauce, until heated through, about 10 minutes. Serve immediately.
