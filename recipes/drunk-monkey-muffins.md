## Ingredients

- 1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 4  ripe bananas
- ⅓ cup softened unsalted butter
- ¾ cup white sugar
- 1  egg
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ¼ cup whiskey (such as Jack Daniel's®)
- ½ cup unsweetened flaked coconut
- 1 cup mini chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups, or line with paper muffin liners. Whisk the flour, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl; set aside.
2. Beat the bananas, butter, and sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Beat in the egg, vanilla extract, and whiskey. Mix in the flour mixture until just incorporated. Fold in the coconut and chocolate chips, mixing just enough to evenly combine. Pour into muffin pan.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
