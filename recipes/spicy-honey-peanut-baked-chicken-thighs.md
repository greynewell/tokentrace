## Ingredients

- 4  bone-in chicken thighs
- ¼ teaspoon salt, or more to taste

- 6 tablespoons powdered peanut butter (such as PB2®)
- 4 tablespoons water
- 2 teaspoons hot honey (such as Mike's Hot Honey®)
- ½ tablespoon soy sauce
- ⅛ teaspoon garlic powder

## Instructions

1. Season chicken thighs on both sides with salt and pepper.
2. Mix peanut butter powder and water together in a large bowl until fully incorporated. Stir in hot honey, soy sauce, and garlic powder; mix until well combined. Add chicken thighs and turn in marinade, making sure both sides are well coated. Cover bowl and refrigerate 8 hours to overnight.
