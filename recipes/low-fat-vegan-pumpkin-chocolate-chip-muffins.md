## Ingredients

- 2 cups whole wheat flour
- ½ cup packed brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1 (15 ounce) can solid-pack pumpkin
- ½ cup water
- ½ cup chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line 12 muffin cups with paper liners.
2. Whisk whole wheat flour, brown sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda, salt, and nutmeg in a large bowl. Stir pumpkin and water into dry ingredients, mixing until just moistened; fold in chocolate chips. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups, filling them to just below the tops.
