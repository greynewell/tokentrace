## Ingredients

- ¼ cup cream cheese, softened
- ¼ cup shredded Cheddar cheese
- 2 slices cooked bacon, crumbled
- 2  green onions, chopped
- 2 tablespoons pesto sauce
- ¼ clove garlic, minced
- 1 pinch dried parsley
- 1  pork tenderloin, butterflied and pounded flat
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 5 tablespoons butter
- ½ cup white wine
- ½ cube chicken bouillon
- ½ cup heavy whipping cream

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking dish.
2. Mix cream cheese, Cheddar cheese, bacon, green onions, pesto sauce, garlic, and parsley together in a bowl. Lay pork tenderloin on a flat work surface and spread cheese mixture on one side of the meat. Roll tenderloin around the filling like a jellyroll. Season meat with salt and black pepper.
3. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place rolled pork tenderloin in hot butter and cook, turning, until browned on all sides, 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer tenderloin to the prepared baking dish, reserving drippings in skillet.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until pork is no longer pink in the center, about 1 1/2 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
5. Place the skillet with reserved drippings over medium-high heat. Pour in white wine and bouillon, bring to a simmer, reduce heat to low, and add cream; stir until sauce thickens slightly, about 5 minutes. Pour sauce over tenderloin.
