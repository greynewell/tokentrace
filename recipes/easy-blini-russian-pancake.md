## Ingredients

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon baking powder
- ¾ cup milk
- 2 tablespoons milk
- 1 large egg
- 1 tablespoon melted unsalted butter
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter

## Instructions

1. Combine flour, salt, and baking powder in a bowl.
2. Whisk 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons milk, egg, and 1 tablespoon melted butter together in a separate bowl. Mix into the flour mixture until the batter is fully combined.
3. Heat 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Cooking several blini at a time, drop batter, one tablespoon at a time, onto the heated skillet. Cook until bubbles form, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Flip and continue cooking until brown, about 1 minute more. Move to a paper towel-lined plate to help soak up excess butter.
4. Repeat with the remaining batter.
