## Ingredients

- 1 (8 ounce) package elbow macaroni
- 1 pound ground beef
- 2 (14.5 ounce) cans Italian-style diced tomatoes
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
- 2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain.
3. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Add ground beef back to skillet and mix in tomatoes; season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir mixture until tomatoes are heated through, about 5 minutes.
4. Transfer beef mixture to a casserole dish; top with cooked macaroni. Spread cream cheese over macaroni and sprinkle Cheddar cheese over cream cheese.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and bubbling, about 45 minutes. Cool casserole for 15 minutes before serving.
