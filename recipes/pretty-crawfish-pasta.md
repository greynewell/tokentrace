## Ingredients

- 1 (16 ounce) package farfalle (bow tie) pasta
- 1 bunch fresh asparagus, trimmed and cut into 2 inch pieces
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 small red onion, chopped
- 1  red or green bell pepper, chopped
- 1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
- 1 pint grape tomatoes, halved
- 1 pound peeled crawfish tails
- ¾ cup herbed vinaigrette salad dressing, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add farfalle pasta, and cook until tender, about 8 minutes. Drain. Place a separate pan of water on to boil. Add asparagus, and cook until tender and bright green, about 3 minutes depending on thickness. Drain, and place into ice water to stop the cooking process.
2. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion and bell pepper; cook and stir for about 5 minutes. Add the mushrooms and crawfish tails; cook and stir for another 10 minutes. Add the asparagus and grape tomatoes to the pan, and cook for a couple of minutes. Remove from the heat and transfer to a large serving bowl.
3. Mix pasta into the serving bowl along with the vinaigrette dressing. Serve immediately, or refrigerate and serve chilled.
