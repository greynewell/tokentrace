## Ingredients

- 8  skinless, boneless chicken breasts
- 1 cup bread crumbs
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- ½ teaspoon garlic salt
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 6 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- 2 (14 ounce) cans diced tomatoes
- 2 teaspoons white sugar
- 1 teaspoon garlic salt
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- ½ teaspoon dried oregano
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 6 ounces sliced pepperoni
- 3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
2. Place chicken breasts between 2 sheets of heavy plastic or waxed paper on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a 1/2-inch thickness.
3. Combine bread crumbs, 1 teaspoon oregano, 1/2 teaspoon garlic salt, salt, and black pepper in a shallow bowl. Dip both sides of chicken in bread crumb mixture until evenly coated.
4. Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook 2 chicken breasts until browned and no longer pink in the center, about 4 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining olive oil and chicken breasts. Arrange chicken breasts in a 9x13-inch baking dish.
5. Combine tomatoes, sugar, garlic salt, basil, oregano, salt, and black pepper for sauce in a saucepan. Cook over medium-low heat until heated through, 10 to 15 minutes. Pour sauce evenly over chicken breasts in the baking dish.
6. Cover tomato sauce with pepperoni and mozzarella cheese.
7. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, 20 to 30 minutes.
