## Ingredients

- ⅔ cup water
- ⅓ cup quinoa
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 cup chopped kale
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ¼ teaspoon sesame oil
- 1 tablespoon water, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Bring 2/3 cup water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes.
2. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Sauté kale and garlic in hot oil until kale is wilted, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
3. Stir quinoa into kale mixture and add sesame oil; cook until flavors blend, about 5 more minutes. Add 1 tablespoon water to mixture to prevent sticking.
