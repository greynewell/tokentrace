## Ingredients

- ¾ cup frozen unsweetened raspberries, thawed
- 1  ripe banana
- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- ¾ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1 cup white sugar
- 2  eggs
- ½ cup vegetable oil
- ½ teaspoon lemon extract

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a loaf pan.
2. Mash thawed raspberries in a bowl with a fork; press raspberries through a sieve to remove seeds. Mash banana in another bowl with a fork.
3. Combine flour, cinnamon, baking soda, salt, and nutmeg in a bowl. Beat sugar, eggs, raspberries, banana, and vegetable oil in a bowl with an electric mixer set on low until smooth, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir flour mixture into raspberry mixture until batter is just moistened; stir in lemon extract. Pour batter into prepared loaf pan.
