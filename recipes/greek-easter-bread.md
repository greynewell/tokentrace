## Ingredients

- 5 ½ cups high-gluten flour, divided
- 2 ½ teaspoons active dry yeast
- 1 cup milk
- ½ cup butter
- ½ cup white sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2  eggs
- 3 tablespoons orange juice
- 1 cup confectioners' sugar
- 1 tablespoon orange juice

## Instructions

1. Mix 2 cups flour and yeast together in the bowl of a stand mixer.
2. Stir milk, butter, sugar, and salt together in a saucepan; heat and stir over medium-low heat until the mixture is smooth and the temperature is between 90 degrees F (32 degrees C) to 100 degrees F (37 degrees C).
3. Pour the milk mixture into the flour mixture, add eggs, and beat on low speed for 30 seconds. Increase speed to high and beat for 3 minutes more. Add 1 cup flour and 3 tablespoons orange juice to the mixture; mix on high for 3 minutes more.
4. Fit the mixer with a dough hook. Add remaining flour to the mixture; beat with dough hook until the flour is completely incorporated.
5. Grease a glass bowl. Put dough into the bowl. Let dough rise until doubled in volume, 1 to 2 hours.
6. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
7. Punch dough down. Divide the dough into two halves. Split each half into three even pieces, roll each piece into a cylinder, and braid into loaves. Put loaves onto a baking sheet. Let rise, about 1 hour.
8. Bake in preheated oven until the middle is baked, 25 to 30 minutes.
9. Stir confectioners' sugar and 1 tablespoon orange juice together in a bowl; brush onto the tops of the loaves.
