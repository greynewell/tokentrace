## Ingredients

- ½ cup dried porcini mushrooms
- 1 cup boiling water
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2  onions, chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- ½ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ½ cup ground walnuts
- 1  bay leaf

## Instructions

1. Soak the porcini mushrooms in the water for 30 seconds.
2. Drain, reserving the liquid, and chop.
3. Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
