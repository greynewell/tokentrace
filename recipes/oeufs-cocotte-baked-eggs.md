## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil, or to taste
- ½ cup finely chopped ham
- 2 tablespoons grated Gruyere cheese, divided
- ½ cup heavy whipping cream
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 2  eggs
- ¼ teaspoon chopped fresh chives

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Boil water in a kettle.
2. Grease a small lidded casserole dish with olive oil. Distribute diced ham over the bottom and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon Gruyere cheese. Pour cream on top and season with a little pepper.
3. Crack eggs into the casserole dish one at a time, making sure egg yolks remain intact. Sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon Gruyere cheese and fresh chives. Season with salt and pepper. Cover casserole dish and place into a roasting pan. Pour in enough boiling water so it reaches about halfway up the casserole dish.
4. Bake in the preheated oven for 9 minutes with the lid on. Uncover and continue baking until the egg whites are just set but the yolks are still runny, 3 to 6 additional minutes.
