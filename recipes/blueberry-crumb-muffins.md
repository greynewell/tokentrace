## Ingredients

- 1 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour
- ⅓ cup white sugar
- ⅓ cup brown sugar
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 2 ½ teaspoons baking powder
- ⅓ cup vegetable oil
- 2  eggs
- ½ cup milk
- 1 ½ cups blueberries
- ⅓ cup all-purpose flour
- ¼ cup butter, softened
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease or line muffin pan.
2. In a large bowl, mix together the flour, white and brown sugars, salt, and baking powder. Stir in oil, eggs, and milk until well blended and very few lumps remain. Gently fold in blueberries being careful not to mash them. Fill muffin tins 2/3 full, or slightly more for a larger muffin top.
