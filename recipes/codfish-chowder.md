## Ingredients

- 8 slices bacon, diced
- 1 large onion, diced
- 1  red bell pepper, seeded and diced
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 2 cloves garlic, chopped
- 1 ½ tablespoons seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®)
- 1 (16 ounce) can chicken broth
- 3  red potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
- 4 ears sweet corn, shucked and kernels cut off
- ½ cup water, or as needed to cover  (Optional)
- 2 cups whole milk, or more as needed
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 pound thick cod fillets, cut into 1-inch pieces
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley

## Instructions

1. Cook bacon in a soup pot over medium heat until crisp and brown, about 10 minutes. Remove bacon with a slotted spoon, leaving drippings in the pot. Cook and stir onion and red bell pepper until softened, about 5 minutes; season with salt and pepper. Stir in garlic and seafood seasoning and cook and stir 2 more minutes.
2. Pour in chicken broth and stir in potatoes and corn; add water if needed to cover vegetables. Bring to a boil and reduce heat to low; simmer until potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes. Stir in milk and butter until butter has melted; mix in reserved bacon. Bring the soup just to the boiling point and stir in cod and parsley; cook, stirring occasionally, until fish flakes easily, 5 to 8 minutes.
