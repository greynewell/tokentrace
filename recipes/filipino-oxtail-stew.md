## Ingredients

- 1 ½ pounds beef oxtail, cut into pieces
- 1 large onion, quartered
- 2 cloves garlic, chopped
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste
- 1 large eggplant, cut into 2-inch chunks
- ½ head bok choy, cut into 1-inch pieces
- ½ pound fresh green beans, trimmed and snapped into 2-inch pieces
- ¼ cup peanut butter, or as needed to thicken sauce

## Instructions

1. Fill a large saucepan with water; add oxtail, onion, garlic, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil, and simmer for 2 hours over medium-low heat, skimming off the foam occasionally, until oxtail meat is very tender and broth is reduced to 3 cups.
2. Stir in eggplant, bok choy, and green beans; simmer for about 20 minutes, until vegetables are tender.
