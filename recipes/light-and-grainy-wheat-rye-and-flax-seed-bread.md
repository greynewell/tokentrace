## Ingredients

- 2 cups boiling water
- 2 cups crushed shredded wheat cereal
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ¼ cup molasses
- 3 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons active dry yeast
- ½ cup warm water
- 1 cup whole wheat flour
- 1 cup rye flour
- ½ cup flax seed
- 3 cups all-purpose flour, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Pour boiling water over shredded wheat cereal in a large mixing bowl.
2. Stir in the salt, molasses, and butter; let cool to about 100 degrees F (40 degrees C), about 15 minutes.
3. Grease two 9x5 inch loaf pans.
4. Sprinkle the yeast over the 1/2 cup of warm water in a small bowl.
5. The water should be no more than 100 degrees F (40 degrees C).
6. Let stand for 5 minutes until the yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam.
7. Stir the yeast mixture into the cooled cereal mixture.
8. Beat in the whole wheat flour, rye flour, and flax seed.
9. Beat in the all-purpose flour.
10. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic but not stiff, about 10 minutes.
11. Lightly oil a large bowl, then place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil.
12. Cover with a light cloth and let rise in a warm place (80 to 95 degrees F (27 to 35 degrees C)) until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
13. Deflate the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface.
14. Use a knife to divide the dough into two equal pieces.
15. Form the dough into 2 loaves, and place the loaves into the prepared pans.
16. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes.
17. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
18. Bake in the preheated oven until the top is golden brown and the bottom of the loaf sounds hollow when tapped, about 50 minutes.
