## Ingredients

- 1 (12 ounce) package extra firm tofu, drained and pressed
- 1 cup self-rising flour
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Drain tofu, place on a plate, and stack heavy plates on top of tofu to drain any remaining moisture, about 15 minutes. Slice into 24 bite-sized pieces.
2. Combine flour, cornstarch, salt, and pepper in a large resealable plastic bag. Toss tofu into the bag, seal, and shake to coat. Transfer tofu to a plate, shaking off any excess flour mixture.
3. Pour oil into a skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Cook tofu in hot oil, turning often, until golden brown on all sides, about 5 minutes per side.
