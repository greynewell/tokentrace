## Ingredients

- ¼ cup warm water (105 to 110 degrees F)
- 2 (.25 ounce) envelopes active dry yeast
- ½ cup shortening
- ½ cup sugar
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- 2  eggs
- 2 cups milk
- 6 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- oil for frying
- 1 cup confectioners' sugar for dusting
- 2 cups heavy cream, whipped
- 1 (1.75 ounce) package sprinkles or colored sugar for decoration

## Instructions

1. Pour warm water into a small bowl, and sprinkle yeast on top; set aside for 5 minutes. Cream together the shortening, sugar, and salt. Add the eggs, one at a time, while continuing to mix. Pour in the milk and the yeast alternating with the flour until smooth. Place dough into a greased bowl, and turn over to grease the top.
2. Cover with a light towel, and let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
3. Once the dough has risen, punch down, and roll out on a floured surface to 1/2 inch thick. Cut into rounds with a 2 inch round cookie cutter, cover, and allow to rise another 30 minutes.
4. Heat deep fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
5. Use your thumb to make an indent in the center of each kneecap. Fry in the hot oil a few at a time until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Remove to drain on a paper towel, and allow to cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. To serve, dust the kneecaps with confectioners' sugar, fill the indents with whipped cream, and sprinkle with colored sugar to decorate.
