## Ingredients

- 4 ounces spaghetti
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2  eggs
- 2 teaspoons garlic powder
- 2 teaspoons ground black pepper
- 1 tablespoon minced onion
- 1 tablespoon dried rosemary

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
2. Meanwhile, in a large skillet melt butter over medium heat; cook eggs sunny-side up (so that egg yolks are not broken). Sprinkle garlic powder, ground black pepper, onion and rosemary on eggs while cooking.
3. Place hot pasta and cooked eggs on a plate and stir together; the broken yolks will create the sauce. Serve hot.
