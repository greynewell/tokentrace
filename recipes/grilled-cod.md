## Ingredients

- 2 (8 ounce) fillets cod, cut in half
- 1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning
- ½ teaspoon lemon pepper
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1  lemon, juiced
- 2 tablespoons chopped green onion (white part only)

## Instructions

1. Stack about 15 charcoal briquettes into a grill in a pyramid shape. If desired, drizzle coals lightly with lighter fluid and allow to soak for 1 minute before lighting coals with a match. Allow fire to spread to all coals, about 10 minutes, before spreading briquettes out into the grill; let coals burn until a thin layer of white ash covers the coals. Lightly oil the grates.
2. Season both sides of cod fillets with Cajun seasoning, lemon pepper, salt, and black pepper. Set fillets aside on a plate.
3. Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat, stir in lemon juice and green onion, and cook until onion is softened, about 3 minutes.
4. Grill fillets on the preheated grill until browned and flaky, about 3 minutes per side; baste frequently with butter mixture while grilling.
5. Allow fillets to rest off the heat for about 5 minutes before serving.
