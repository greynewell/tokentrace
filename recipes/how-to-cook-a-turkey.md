## Ingredients

- 1  onion, coarsely chopped
- 1 stalk celery, coarsely chopped
- 1  carrot, coarsely chopped
- 1 (12 pound) whole turkey, neck and giblets reserved
- 2 tablespoons kosher salt
- 1 tablespoon ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 3 tablespoons butter
- 4 sprigs fresh rosemary
- ½ bunch chopped fresh sage

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
2. Place onion, celery, and carrot in a large, shallow roasting pan.
3. Place turkey, breast-side up, on top of vegetables in the roasting pan. Pat outside and inside of turkey dry with paper towels.
4. Combine salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper in a small bowl. Season inside of turkey with about 1/3 of the salt mixture. Fold wing tips under bird.
5. Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat until edges turn golden, about 2 minutes. Add rosemary and sage; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute.
6. Place rosemary and sage inside cavity of turkey; reserve melted butter. Tie turkey legs together with twine.
7. Brush melted butter over turkey. Season with the remaining salt mixture.
