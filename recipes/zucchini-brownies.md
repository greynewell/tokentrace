## Ingredients

- ½ cup vegetable oil
- 1 ½ cups white sugar
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- ½ cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 ½ teaspoons baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 cups shredded zucchini
- ½ cup chopped walnuts
- 6 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
- ¼ cup margarine
- 2 cups confectioners' sugar

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch baking pan.
