## Ingredients

- 1 ½ tablespoons butter, divided
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- ½  onion, diced
- ¼ teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 pound ground beef
- 1 (12 ounce) package egg noodles
- 2 tablespoons sour cream
- 1 (10.75 ounce) can  condensed cream of mushroom soup

## Instructions

1. Heat 1 tablespoon butter and oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic powder; cook and stir until onion is golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Reduce heat to medium. Add ground beef; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes more.
