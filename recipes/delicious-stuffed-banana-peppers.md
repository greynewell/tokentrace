## Ingredients

- toothpicks
- 2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
- ½ cup chopped sun-dried tomatoes
- 3 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro
- 10  banana peppers
- 10 slices peppered bacon, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Soak toothpicks in water for 15 minutes.
2. Combine cream cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, garlic, and cilantro in a large bowl. Mix well.
3. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
4. Cut a slit lengthwise through each pepper without slicing it in half. Cut another slit about 1/4 inch from the stem across the previous slit, forming a 'T'. Remove seeds, as desired, using a paring knife.
5. Fill each pepper with the cream cheese stuffing mixture using a small spoon. Wrap each pepper with a slice of raw bacon. Slide 1 toothpick through the center of each pepper to hold onto the bacon and keep pepper closed.
6. Grill stuffed peppers for 15 minutes. Turn and cook until bacon is crisp, about 10 minutes more.
