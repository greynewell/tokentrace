## Ingredients

- ¼ cup butter
- ⅓ cup ketchup
- ¼ cup brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons cornstarch
- ¼ cup vinegar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon soy sauce
- ½ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1 (9 ounce) can crushed pineapple
- 3 pounds assorted chicken pieces such as breasts, thighs, wings, and drumsticks

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
2. Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat; stir ketchup and brown sugar into melted butter, stirring to dissolve brown sugar. Whisk cornstarch into vinegar until smooth; pour into pan. Whisk constantly and add salt, soy sauce, and Worcestershire sauce to mixture; bring to a simmer. Cook until thickened, about 2 minutes. Stir pineapple into sauce.
3. Arrange chicken pieces in a 9x13-inch baking dish; pour pineapple sauce over chicken.
4. Bake until sauce is bubbling, chicken is browned, and the juices run clear, about 45 minutes. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a thigh should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
