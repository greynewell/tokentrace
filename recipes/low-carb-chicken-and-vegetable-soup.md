## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 4  bone-in chicken thighs, skin removed
- 4  carrots, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
- 4 stalks celery, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
- 1 small onion, chopped
- 1 (32 fluid ounce) container chicken stock
- 2 cups water
- 2 cups chopped fresh green beans
- 2 cups frozen riced cauliflower, thawed and drained
- 2 cups finely chopped broccoli
- ½ (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
- 2 teaspoons chicken soup base (such as Better Than Bouillon®)
- 1 large bay leaf
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a 6-quart Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add chicken thighs and sear, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove and set aside.
2. Add carrots and celery to the pan. Reduce heat to medium and cook until softened, about 10 minutes. Add onions and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low and add chicken stock, water, green beans, riced cauliflower, broccoli, tomato sauce, soup base, bay leaf, salt, and pepper. Add chicken thighs and simmer until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 30 to 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
3. Remove chicken and shred meat. Place shredded chicken back in the soup and serve.
