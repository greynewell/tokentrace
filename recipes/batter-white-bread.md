## Ingredients

- 1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
- 2 tablespoons shortening
- 1 ¼ cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 3 cups sifted all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon butter, melted

## Instructions

1. Combine 1 1/4 cups sifted flour, warm water, shortening, sugar, salt, and yeast in a large bowl; beat by hand for 300 strokes or with an electric mixer for 3 minutes. Mix in remaining 1 3/4 cups sifted flour, scraping the bowl often, until dough is smooth. Cover with a clean cloth and let rise until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
2. Lightly grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan. Punch dough down gently; it will be sticky. Spoon into the prepared loaf pan, patting it down and shaping it with floured hands. Cover and let rise for 30 minutes.
3. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
4. Uncover dough and bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 45 minutes.
5. Remove from the oven and place on a cooling rack. Brush melted butter over top and let cool.
