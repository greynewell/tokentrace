## Ingredients

- 2 quarts vegetable oil for frying
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ (.13 ounce) envelope unsweetened soft drink mix, any flavor (such as KOOL-AID®)
- 1 cup milk
- 2  eggs
- 3 tablespoons melted butter
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 cup white sugar
- ½ (.13 ounce) envelope unsweetened soft drink mix, any flavor (such as KOOL-AID®)

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C). Mix 3 cups flour, 1 cup sugar, the baking powder, salt, and 1/2 packet of the soft drink mix together in a large bowl.
2. Whisk the milk, eggs, butter, and vanilla extract together in a separate large bowl until blended; slowly stir in the flour mixture until entirely incorporated in a batter the consistency of a thick pancake batter.
3. Drop the batter by large spoonfuls, about 2 teaspoons in size, into the preheated oil; fry until deep golden brown on all sides, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove to drain on a platter lined with paper towels.
4. Mix together 1 cup sugar with the remaining 1/2 packet of soft drink mix in a flat-bottomed dish. Roll the drained donuts in the sugar mixture while still hot. Set aside on a fresh set of paper towels to cool slightly; serve warm.
