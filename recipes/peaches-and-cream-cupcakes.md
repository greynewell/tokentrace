## Ingredients

- 3 ½ cups pureed peaches
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch
- 2 tablespoons water
- 2 ⅔ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 2 cups white sugar
- 8 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 2 large eggs
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon peach extract
- 1 ½ cups buttermilk
- ½ cup pureed peaches
- 2 cups heavy whipping cream
- 2 tablespoons instant vanilla pudding mix
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Combine pureed peaches and sugar for filling in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a slight boil.
2. Mix cornstarch and water together in a separate bowl until there are no lumps. Stir mixture into the pan. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook until thick and bubbly, about 1 minute. Let filling cool completely.
3. While filling cools, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line two 12-cup muffin tins with paper liners.
4. Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a medium bowl for cupcakes.
5. Beat sugar and butter together in a large bowl using an electric mixer until creamy. Beat in eggs, vanilla extract, and peach extract until smooth. Add 1/2 of the flour mixture and stir until combined. Add buttermilk and 1/2 cup pureed peaches; stir until almost combined. Add remaining flour mixture and stir until all ingredients are mixed in.
6. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 2/3 full.
7. Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, 18 to 20 minutes. Cool in the tins for 10 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool, about 20 minutes.
8. Remove a bit of the center of each cupcake using a cupcake corer; fill with cooled peach filling.
9. Beat whipping cream, pudding mix, and vanilla extract for frosting together using a wire whisk attachment until firm peaks form. Frost cooled cupcakes.
