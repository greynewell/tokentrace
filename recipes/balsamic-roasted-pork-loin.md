## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons steak seasoning rub
- ½ cup balsamic vinegar
- ½ cup olive oil
- 2 pounds boneless pork loin roast

## Instructions

1. Combine vinegar and steak seasoning in a medium bowl; stir until seasoning is dissolved. Stir in olive oil until combined.
2. Place pork into a resealable plastic bag, then pour marinade over pork. Squeeze out air and seal the bag; marinate in the refrigerator for 2 hours to overnight.
3. When ready to cook, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
4. Place pork into a glass baking dish along with marinade.
5. Bake in the preheated oven, basting occasionally, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the tenderloin reaches an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (65 degrees C), about 1 hour.
6. Let rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.
