## Ingredients

- ½ cup all-purpose flour
- 1 large egg
- ¼ cup milk
- 2 cups panko bread crumbs
- 1 teaspoon sea salt
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 pound calamari rings, patted dry
- nonstick cooking spray

## Instructions

1. Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Place flour in a bowl. Whisk egg and milk in a separate bowl. Combine panko, salt, and pepper in a third bowl.
3. Coat calamari rings first in flour, then in egg mixture, and finally in panko mixture.
4. Place rings in the basket of the air fryer so that none overlap. Work in batches if needed. Spray tops with nonstick cooking spray.
