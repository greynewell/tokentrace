## Ingredients

- ½ cup all-purpose flour
- ½ cup white sugar
- 5 tablespoons white sugar, divided
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter
- ½ cup milk
- 2 ounces dark chocolate, melted
- 1  egg
- 1  orange, juiced
- 3 tablespoons white sugar
- ½ cup unsalted butter, softened
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, softened
- 9 ounces confectioners' sugar
- 2 tablespoons milk, or more as needed
- 2 ounces white chocolate, melted
- 1  orange, zested
- 4 ounces orange-flavored chocolate

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners.
2. Mix flour, 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar, and baking powder together in a food processor. Add butter and pulse until combined.
3. Whisk milk, melted dark chocolate, and egg together in a measuring cup. Stir chocolate mixture into the flour mixture until just combined. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 10 minutes.
5. Heat orange juice and remaining 3 tablespoons sugar together over low heat until sugar has dissolved, 3 to 4 minutes. Carefully spoon orange juice mixture over warm cupcakes and set aside to cool completely, 15 to 30 minutes more.
6. Beat 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon butter together in a bowl using an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Carefully stir in confectioners' sugar and continue to beat for 5 minutes. Beat in milk, melted white chocolate, and orange zest.
7. Decorate cooled cupcakes with icing.
8. Cut orange-flavored chocolate into shavings using a sharp knife or a vegetable peeler and use to decorate cupcakes.
