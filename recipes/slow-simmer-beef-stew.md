## Ingredients

- 2 pounds beef stew meat, cut into cubes
- ½ cup all-purpose flour, or more as needed
- ¼ cup butter
- ¼ cup olive oil
- 1 teaspoon seasoned salt
- 1  onion, chopped
- 8 cups beef broth, divided
- 6 cups sliced carrots
- 6 cups diced potatoes
- 3 cups chopped celery
- 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1 teaspoon dried parsley
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- ½ teaspoon paprika
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder

## Instructions

1. Combine beef stew meat and flour in a resealable plastic bag; seal bag and shake to coat beef.
2. Melt butter with olive oil in a large pot over high heat; add beef and season with seasoned salt. Cook and stir beef until seared on all sides 5 to 7 minutes. Stir onion into the beef; cook and stir until the onion is browned, about 5 minutes more.
3. Pour enough of the beef broth into the pot to cover the bottom; bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Add remainder of the beef broth; bring to a simmer before adding carrots, potatoes, celery, balsamic vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, parsley, basil, paprika, and garlic powder.
4. Bring liquid to a boil, reduce heat to low, and cook stew at a simmer until the meat and vegetables are very tender, 3 to 4 hours.
