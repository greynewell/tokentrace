## Ingredients

- 2 pounds beef chuck roast
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 tablespoon butter
- ½ pound white mushrooms, sliced
- 4  green onions, sliced (white and green parts)
- 2 tablespoons butter, divided
- ⅓ cup white wine
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- 1 ¼ cups reduced-sodium beef stock, divided
- 1 teaspoon prepared mustard
- ⅓ cup light sour cream
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Remove any fat and gristle from the roast and cut into strips 1/2-inch thick by 2-inches long. Season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.
2. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms and green onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms are browned, about 6 minutes. Remove to a bowl and add 1 tablespoon butter to the skillet. Cook and stir one half the beef strips until browned, about 5 minutes, then remove to a bowl. Repeat with the remaining butter and beef strips. Pour wine into the hot skillet and deglaze the pan, scraping up any browned bits.
3. Combine flour and 1/4 cup beef broth in a jar with a tightly fitting lid and shake until combined. Stir into the skillet, whisking until smooth. Stir in the remaining broth and mustard, then return the beef to the pan. Bring to a simmer. Cover and simmer until the meat is tender, about 1 hour.
4. Stir in the prepared mushrooms and the sour cream five minutes before serving. Heat briefly and season with salt and pepper.
