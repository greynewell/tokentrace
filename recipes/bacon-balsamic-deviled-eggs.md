## Ingredients

- 12  eggs
- 4 slices bacon
- ½ cup mayonnaise
- ¼ cup minced red onion
- 2 teaspoons white sugar
- ½ teaspoon balsamic vinegar
- ¼ teaspoon celery salt
- ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- ¼ cup chopped fresh parsley

## Instructions

1. Place eggs in a large pot in a single layer and cover with water by 1 inch. Cover the saucepan and bring the water to a boil; immediately remove from the heat and let eggs stand in the hot water for 15 minutes. Drain. Cool eggs under cold running water in the sink. Peel and halve lengthwise. Separate the yolks from the whites, placing the yolks in a bowl. Arrange the egg whites with the rounded side down onto a serving platter.
2. While eggs are cooking, place bacon in a large, deep skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate; chop.
3. Mash yolks with a fork. Add bacon, mayonnaise, onion, sugar, vinegar, celery salt, and pepper; stir until thoroughly combined. Spoon the mixture into the egg whites. Garnish with parsley.
