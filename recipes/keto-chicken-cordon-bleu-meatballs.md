## Ingredients

- 1 pound ground chicken
- ⅓ cup blanched almond flour
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon onion powder
- 1  egg, lightly beaten
- 6 ounces ham steak, cubed into 20 even pieces
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 tablespoon butter
- ¾ cup chicken broth
- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- ½ cup heavy cream
- 1 cup shredded Swiss cheese
- 1 pinch cracked black pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Combine chicken, almond flour, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, and egg in a bowl. Form a small portion of chicken mixture into a 1 1/2-inch ball around a cube of ham; place on a plate. Repeat with remaining chicken mixture and ham, making 20 meatballs total.
2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Brown meatballs for 3 minutes on one side; turn and cook an additional 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer meatballs onto a clean plate.
3. Return the skillet to medium heat and melt butter. Whisk in chicken broth and Dijon mustard; bring to a simmer for 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in heavy cream and whisk until sauce begins to simmer. Whisk in Swiss cheese until completely melted. Return meatballs to skillet and simmer until sauce has slightly thickened, 3 to 4 minutes. Season with cracked black pepper and parsley. Serve immediately. Sauce will further thicken upon cooling.
