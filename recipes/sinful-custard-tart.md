## Ingredients

- 1 (9 inch) refrigerated pie crust
- 4 large eggs
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 ½ cups half-and-half
- ¾ cup 2% milk
- ¼ cup rum
- ⅛ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1  egg white, beaten until frothy

## Instructions

1. Position 1 oven rack in the bottom of the oven and 1 in the middle. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Unroll pie crust and place in a 9-inch pie plate, crimping the edge.
2. Bake pie crust on the middle rack of the preheated oven for 20 minutes.
3. While the crust is baking, combine eggs and sugar in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until well combined. Add half-and-half, milk, rum, and salt; mix on low until incorporated. Mix nutmeg and cinnamon together in a small bowl.
4. Remove crust from the oven and brush with egg white; bake for another 5 minutes.
5. Remove crust from the oven; increase temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Carefully pour filling into the pie crust. Sprinkle with spice mixture.
6. Bake on the bottom rack of the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Reduce the heat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Move the pie to the middle rack and bake until the middle of the pie is almost set, about 25 minutes. Place on a cooling rack; it will continue to cook after it's taken out of the oven.
