## Ingredients

- 1 (15.25 ounce) package white cake mix (such as Pillsbury®)
- 3 ounces white cake mix extender
- 1 ¼ cups water
- 4  egg whites
- ⅓ cup vegetable oil
- 1 cup white sugar
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch
- 1 ½ cups fresh blueberries
- 1 cup water
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and lightly flour a 9x13-inch baking pan.
2. Blend cake mix plus extender, 1 1/4 cups water, egg whites, and oil together in a bowl using an electric mixer until just moistened. Pour batter into the prepared pan.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 32 to 26 minutes.
4. While cake is baking, stir sugar and cornstarch together in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add 1 cup water and bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Add blueberries and lemon juice; cook and stir until blueberries burst and sauce turns a deep purple color, about 10 minutes. Gently mash any berries that did not burst. Remove from heat and let cool until cake is ready.
5. Transfer cake to a cooling rack and let cool to room temperature, at least 25 minutes.
6. Poke holes into the cake about 1 inch apart using the handle of a wooden spoon. Slowly pour the warm blueberry sauce over cake. Refrigerate until cool before slicing.
