## Ingredients

- 1 cup brown sugar, or more to taste
- 3 tablespoons red chili powder
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper, or more to taste
- 1 (12 ounce) package thinly sliced bacon
- 1 (15 ounce) package short pretzel rods

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and top with a wire rack.
2. Mix brown sugar, chili powder, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl. Dredge both sides of each bacon slice in the brown sugar mixture.
