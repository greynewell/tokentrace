## Ingredients

- 1 cup white rice flour
- ¾ cup white sugar
- ½ cup oat flour
- ½ cup all-purpose gluten-free flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1  egg
- ⅔ cup milk
- ⅓ cup vegetable oil
- ⅓ cup yogurt
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- ½ cup chopped walnuts
- ½ cup raisins
- ½ cup pumpkin puree

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line muffin cups with paper liners.
2. Mix rice flour, sugar, oat flour, all-purpose flour, baking powder, and cinnamon together in a large bowl.

Beat egg, milk, vegetable oil, yogurt, and vanilla together in a separate bowl until smooth; add to the dry ingredients and mix by hand until mostly smooth with only small lumps and you cannot see any patches of dry material in the batter.
