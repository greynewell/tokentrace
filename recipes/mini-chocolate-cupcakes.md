## Ingredients

- ½ cup all-purpose flour
- ¼ cup light brown sugar
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
- ¼ teaspoon baking soda
- ¼ teaspoon baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ⅓ cup whole milk
- 1  egg
- 4 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- ⅓ cup prepared chocolate pudding (such as Jell-O®)
- ¼ cup semisweet chocolate chips (such as Nestle® Toll House®), or to taste  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 16 mini muffin cups with paper liners.
2. Mix flour, brown sugar, white sugar, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Break up clumps lightly with a whisk.
3. Mix milk, egg, oil, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl until well incorporated. Whisk into the flour mixture until well incorporated and there are no clumps. Do not overmix the batter. Fold in pudding with a spatula while scraping the bottom of the bowl. Stir in chocolate chips; batter will be runny and not very thick.
4. Pour batter into the prepared cupcake cups with a Wilton® cookie scoop or measuring cup with a spout, filling each 2/3 full.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean, about 10 minutes.
