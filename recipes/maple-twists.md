## Ingredients

- 3 ounces cream cheese, softened
- ¼ cup confectioners' sugar
- 2 tablespoons margarine, softened
- 1 cup packed brown sugar
- ½ cup chopped walnuts
- ⅓ cup maple flavored syrup
- 2 cups baking mix
- ¼ cup milk
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 1  egg

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 C).
2. Mix cream cheese, confectioner's sugar, and margarine or butter. Reserve.
3. Mix brown sugar, nuts, and syrup in ungreased 13x9x2 inch pan. Spread evenly.
4. Mix baking mix, milk, white sugar, and egg until dough forms. Beat vigorously 20 strokes. Gently smooth dough into a ball on a cloth-covered board dusted with baking mix. Knead 8 times.
