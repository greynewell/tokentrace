## Ingredients

- ½ cup finely chopped pecans
- ½ cup dry bread crumbs
- 8  breast half, bone and skin removed (blank)s skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- ¼ cup clarified butter, melted
- ¼ cup Dijon mustard
- ¼ cup dark brown sugar
- 2 ⅔ tablespoons bourbon whiskey
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
- ¾ cup unsalted butter, chilled and cut into small cubes

## Instructions

1. Stir together the pecans, bread crumbs, and 2 tablespoons of clarified butter. Spread the mixture out on a plate. Press the chicken breasts into the mixture to coat on both sides. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of clarified butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Place the coated chicken breasts in the pan, and fry on both sides until nicely browned and chicken meat is cooked through, about 10 minutes per side.
