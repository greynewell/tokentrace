## Ingredients

- 1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
- ¼ teaspoon baking soda
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ½ cup butter
- ¼ cup white sugar
- ¾ cup packed light brown sugar
- 1  egg
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ½ cup white sugar

## Instructions

1. Sift together the flour, baking soda, and salt; set aside. In a medium bowl, cream butter with 1/4 cup white sugar and brown sugar. Mix in egg and vanilla. Add the sifted dry ingredients, and mix until well blended. Divide dough into 3 equal portions. Roll into logs 2 inches in diameter, wrap, and refrigerate for 3 to 4 hours.
