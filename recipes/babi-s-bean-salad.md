## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups dried black-eyed peas, soaked overnight
- ⅓ cup chopped celery, with leaves
- 1 ½ cups shredded carrot
- ¾ cup chopped fresh parsley
- ½ cup chopped white onion
- ⅛ cup chopped fresh mint
- ¼ cup olive oil
- 2  oranges, juiced
- ½  lemon, juiced
- 1  garlic clove, pressed
- ½ teaspoon ground coriander
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ⅛ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

## Instructions

1. Place the beans in a saucepan with enough water to cover them by one inch. Bring beans to a slow boil. Reduce heat to low, and simmer until tender but not mushy (about 35 minutes). Set aside to cool.
2. When the beans have cooled, place them in a large bowl. Add the celery, carrots, parsley, white onion, and mint; toss to blend.
3. For dressing, blend olive oil, orange and lemon juice, garlic, coriander, salt, pepper, and brown sugar in a blender for 6 seconds.
