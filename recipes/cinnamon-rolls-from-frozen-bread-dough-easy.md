## Ingredients

- 1 (1 pound) loaf frozen bread dough, thawed
- 2 tablespoons butter, melted
- ⅔ cup brown sugar
- ½ cup chopped walnuts
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ⅓ cup heavy whipping cream
- ⅔ cup sifted confectioners' sugar
- 1 tablespoon milk, or more as needed
- 1 dash vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Lightly grease two 9-inch round cake pans with 1 tablespoon melted butter; set aside.
2. Roll bread dough out to an 18x6-inch rectangle and brush with remaining tablespoon melted butter. Mix brown sugar, walnuts, and cinnamon in a bowl; sprinkle over dough. Roll dough into a log, starting at a long edge. Moisten the other long edge with a little water; press to seal.
3. Cut log into 20 slices. Arrange rolls, cut-sides down, in the prepared cake pans. Cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours.
4. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
5. Pour heavy cream over rolls.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 25 minutes.
7. Make icing: Stir confectioners' sugar, milk, and vanilla in a bowl until smooth and pourable. Add more milk or sugar as needed to reach desired consistency.
8. Drizzle icing over warm cinnamon rolls.
