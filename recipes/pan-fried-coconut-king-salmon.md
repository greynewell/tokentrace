## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 4 tablespoons brown sugar
- 4 tablespoons shredded coconut
- ½ teaspoon sea salt
- ½ pound skinless king salmon fillet, cut into small pieces and brought to room temperature

## Instructions

1. Melt 1 1/2 tablespoons butter in a small microwave-safe bowl. Set aside.
2. Mix brown sugar, coconut, and salt together in a shallow bowl.
3. Heat remaining butter in a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Dip each piece of salmon first into the melted butter and then into the coconut mixture; drop into the hot butter. Sear quickly, about 2 minutes. Flip and sear on the other side, about 2 minutes more.
4. Remove skillet from the heat and cover for a few minutes or until ready to serve; this helps caramelize the coconut crust.
