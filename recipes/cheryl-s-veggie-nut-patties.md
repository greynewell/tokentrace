## Ingredients

- ⅔ cup 1/2-inch butternut squash cubes
- ½ cup chopped cauliflower
- ½ cup chopped broccoli
- ½ cup raw walnuts
- ¼ cup raw almonds
- ¼ cup raw sunflower seed kernels
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground cumin
- ⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil

## Instructions

1. Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add butternut squash cubes, cover, and steam until tender, 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer squash to a bowl and mash; measure 1/2 cup mashed squash and reserve.
2. Place the steamer insert back into the saucepan and refill with water to reach just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add cauliflower and broccoli, cover, and steam until tender, 2 to 6 minutes.
3. Process walnuts, almonds, and sunflower seeds together in a blender or food processor until mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs. Add broccoli and cauliflower, blend until finely chopped and incorporated.
4. Blend 1/2 cup mashed squash, salt, cumin, and black pepper into the nuts mixture until well-mixed. If mixture is too thick to process, transfer it to a bowl and mix by hand.
5. Divide mixture into 4 equal portions and shape into patties.
6. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook patties in hot oil until browned and heated through, about 2 minutes per side.
