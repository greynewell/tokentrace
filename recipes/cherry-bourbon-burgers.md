## Ingredients

- ¾ pound ground venison
- ¼ pound ground beef
- 6 fluid ounces cherry-flavored Kentucky bourbon whiskey (such as Evan Williams®), or more as desired
- 5 slices bacon, cooked and crumbled
- 1 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper
- 1 cup barbeque sauce
- 4 slices pepper Jack cheese

## Instructions

1. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
2. Combine venison and ground beef together in a bowl.
3. Add bourbon; set aside until liquid is absorbed, about 10 minutes.
4. Add bacon and black pepper; mix until thoroughly combined.
5. Form into 4 equal-sized burger patties.
6. Cook burgers on preheated grill, basting with barbeque sauce throughout cooking, until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 5 minutes per side.
