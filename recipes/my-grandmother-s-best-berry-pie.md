## Ingredients

- 1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour
- ⅜ cup butter
- 3 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ⅜ cup white sugar
- 1  egg
- 2 ½ cups fresh blueberries

## Instructions

1. To Make Crust: Blend the flour and the butter or margarine thoroughly. Add baking powder, vanilla, sugar, and egg; mix thoroughly. Let the dough rest for about 25 minutes.
