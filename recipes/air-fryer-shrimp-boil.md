## Ingredients

- 1 pound baby red potatoes
- ¼ cup water
- 8 ounces Cajun-style andouille sausage, sliced
- 1 ear corn, sliced in half lengthwise and cut into 2-inch pieces
- 1 medium onion, sliced into petals
- 4 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- 3 teaspoons seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®), divided
- 1 pound raw large shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 1  lemon, cut into wedges

## Instructions

1. Preheat the air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Place potatoes in a microwave-safe bowl. Add water and microwave on high for 5 minutes. Run the bowl under cold water until potatoes are cool enough to touch.
3. Slice potatoes in half lengthwise and place in a large bowl. Add sausage, corn, and onion. Mix in 3 tablespoons olive oil and 2 teaspoons seafood seasoning; stir to coat.
4. Place shrimp in a separate bowl and add remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 teaspoon seafood seasoning; stir to coat.
5. Place 1/2 of the potato mixture in the basket of the air fryer and cook for 10 minutes. Stir and cook for another 5 minutes. Add 1/2 of the shrimp and cook until potatoes are tender, sausage is cooked through, and shrimp are bright pink on the outside and meat is opaque, about 5 more minutes. Transfer to a serving plate and repeat with remaining potato mixture and shrimp. Serve with lemon wedges.
