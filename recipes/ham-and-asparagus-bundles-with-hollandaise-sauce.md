## Ingredients

- 1 (.9 ounce) package hollandaise sauce mix (such as Knorr®)
- 1 cup whole milk
- ¼ cup butter
- 1 pound fresh asparagus, trimmed
- 4 slices deli-style honey ham, sliced in half lengthwise
- ½ teaspoon freeze-dried dill

## Instructions

1. Whisk sauce mix and milk together in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Add butter. Bring to a boil, stirring until melted and smooth. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until thick, about 1 minute. Set aside to cool slightly.
2. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook asparagus for 3 minutes. Drain and run under cold water to stop the cooking process. Transfer to a cutting board and pat dry with paper towels.
3. Wrap a slice of ham around 4 asparagus spears and place on a serving tray. Repeat with remaining asparagus and ham. Drizzle hollandaise sauce over the asparagus bundles and garnish with dill.
