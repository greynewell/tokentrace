## Ingredients

- 2 cups margarine
- 4 (3 ounce) packages cream cheese
- 4 cups all-purpose flour
- 3  eggs
- 2 ½ cups packed brown sugar
- 3 tablespoons melted butter
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 pinch salt
- 1 ½ cups chopped pecans

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Beat margarine and cream cheese with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Beat in flour, 1 cup at a time, until the mixture forms a smooth dough. Roll into small balls, and press into the bottoms and sides of tart pans or mini muffin pans.
3. Mix brown sugar, eggs, melted butter, vanilla, and salt together in a medium bowl until smooth. Stir in pecans; spoon mixture into each crust until 2/3 full.
