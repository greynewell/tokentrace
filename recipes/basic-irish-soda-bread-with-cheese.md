## Ingredients

- 2  eggs, beaten
- ⅓ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- 1 cup milk, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Beat eggs in a bowl and set aside. Place the Parmesan cheese into a shallow bowl.
2. In a bowl, mix the flour, salt, and baking soda until well combined. Add in milk, several tablespoons at a time, until the mixture forms a soft dough. Turn the dough out onto a well-floured work surface, and knead several times until the dough comes together.
3. Roll the dough out into a rectangle about 1/2 inch thick, and cut into 2x3-inch squares. Brush each square with beaten egg, and dip the top of the square into the Parmesan cheese. Place the squares onto the prepared baking sheet.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until the squares are lightly browned, about 10 minutes.
