## Ingredients

- 2 pounds jumbo shrimp, peeled and deveined
- salt and pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons butter
- ¼ cup lemon juice
- 1 cup steak sauce (e.g. A-1)
- 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
- 3 fluid ounces dry sherry or Madeira
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 3 tablespoons water
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 tablespoon canola oil

## Instructions

1. Season shrimp with salt and pepper. Set aside.
2. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add lemon juice, steak sauce, Worcestershire sauce and sherry or Madeira. In a small bowl, whisk together flour and water, then whisk into the steak sauce mixture. Cook and stir constantly until thickened and smooth. Adjust the thickness of the sauce, if necessary, adding a little more steak sauce if too thin or more sherry if too thick. Keep warm while cooking shrimp.
