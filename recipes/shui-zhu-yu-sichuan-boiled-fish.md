## Ingredients

- 1  egg white, beaten
- ½ teaspoon cornstarch
- ¼ teaspoon ground white pepper

## Instructions

1. Stir the egg white, cornstarch, white pepper, and egg white together in a bowl; add the basa and mix to coat.

3. Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir the peppercorns and dried chile peppers in the hot oil until they turn a very dark red (they will look almost black, so be careful not to burn the chiles).
4. Remove the dried chili peppers and peppercorns from the skillet.
5. Mince the chile peppers.
6. Mash the peppercorns finely; set aside.
7. Return the skillet to the medium heat and add 1 tablespoon vegetable oil and the bean sauce; cook and stir the bean sauce with the oil until the mixture turns red.
8. Stir the water into the sauce, increase heat to high and cook until the sauce simmers.
9. Remove the ginger slices from the marinating fish and add to the boiling sauce; cook the fish at a boil until the flesh turns white.
10. Divide the celery and cabbage between two soup bowls.
11. Pour the fish and sauce over the celery and cabbage.
12. Top with the garlic, peppercorns, and chile peppers.
