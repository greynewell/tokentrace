## Ingredients

- 1 ½ tablespoons butter, or as needed
- 2 cups white sugar
- 1 cup light corn syrup
- 3 cups unsalted cashews, a mixture of whole and chopped
- 2 teaspoons butter
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Spread 1 1/2 tablespoons butter all over a rimmed baking sheet until heavily coated.
2. Stir sugar and corn syrup together in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high, uncovered, for 4 1/2 minutes. Stir and microwave for 3 minutes longer.
