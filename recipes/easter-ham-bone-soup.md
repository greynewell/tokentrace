## Ingredients

- 3 quarts water
- 1  ham bone
- 5  potatoes, cut into 1-inch cubes
- 4 cups chopped cabbage
- 2 large stalks  celery, chopped
- 5  green onions, chopped, or more to taste
- ½ cup water
- ⅓ cup all-purpose flour
- 1 cup light whipping cream

## Instructions

1. Bring 3 quarts water and ham bone to a boil in a large stock pot. Boil until meat from the bone comes off easily, about 1 hour. Remove bone from broth. Allow bone to cool enough to touch; remove as much meat from as possible. Transfer meat to a resealable plastic bag, seal, and refrigerate.
2. Pour broth into a large bowl; cover and refrigerate overnight. Skim and discard any fat from the top of the chilled broth; transfer broth to a large pot.
3. Bring broth to a boil; add potatoes, cabbage, celery, and reserved ham. Continue to simmer until potatoes are tender, about 45 minutes.
4. Whisk 1/2 cup water and flour in a bowl; whisk into potato-ham soup until thickened. Add light cream; stir.
