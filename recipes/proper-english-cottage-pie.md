## Ingredients

- 1 pound lean ground beef
- 1  onion, diced
- 3  carrots, diced
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
- 1 ½ cups beef broth
- 1 tablespoon tomato paste
- salt and pepper to taste
- 4  potatoes, peeled and diced
- ¼ cup butter, softened
- 1 cup milk
- salt and pepper to taste
- ¼ pound shredded Cheddar cheese

## Instructions

1. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and carrot; cook and stir until onion has softened, about 5 minutes. Mix in flour, Italian seasoning, and cinnamon. Stir in parsley.
2. Combine beef broth and tomato paste together in a jug; add to beef mixture. Season with salt and pepper; lower heat and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened.
3. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
4. Meanwhile, place diced potatoes in a medium saucepan; cover with water and place over high heat. Bring to a boil and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes; drain. Mash potatoes until smooth, then add milk and butter; whip until fluffy. Season with salt and pepper.
5. Spoon ground beef mixture into a 9x13-inch baking dish; spread mashed potatoes on top and sprinkle with grated Cheddar cheese.
6. Bake in preheated oven until top is browned and cheese is bubbly, about 25 minutes.
