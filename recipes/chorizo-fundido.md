## Ingredients

- 8 ounces fresh pork chorizo
- ½ cup sliced green onions, white and lighter green parts (green parts reserved)
- 1  red bell pepper, diced
- 2  poblano chile peppers, diced
- 2  jalapeno peppers, diced
- 4 ounces cream cheese
- 8 ounces shredded Monterey Jack cheese
- 4 ounces shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
- ¼ cup sour cream

## Instructions

1. Place chorizo, green onions, red bell pepper, poblano chilies, and jalapeno in a cold skillet. Turn heat to medium-high. As skillet comes up to temperature break up chorizo into very small pieces. Continue cooking until sausage is browned and peppers are barely cooked through, 4 to 6 minutes. Remove from heat. If sausage releases a lot of grease, mop up some with a paper towel.
2. Mix cream cheese, sausage mixture, Monterey Jack cheese, Cheddar cheese, and sour cream in a bowl. Transfer to a shallow, heat-proof baking dish.
3. Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
4. Broil on high until browned and bubbly, 5 or 6 minutes.
