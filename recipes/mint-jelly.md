## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups packed fresh mint leaves and stems
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 2 ¼ cups boiling water
- 1 drop green food color
- 3 ½ cups white sugar
- ½ (6 fluid ounce) container liquid pectin

## Instructions

1. Rinse off mint leaves and stems; place them into a medium saucepan. Crush with a potato masher or the bottom of a jar or glass. Add boiling water; cover and let stand for 10 minutes.
2. Strain mint mixture; measure out 1 2/3 cups mint and return to the saucepan. Stir in lemon juice and food coloring. Mix in sugar and place the pan over high heat. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Stir in pectin; boil mixture for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Remove from heat and skim foam off the top using a large metal spoon. Transfer mixture to hot, sterile jars and seal.
3. Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then carefully lower the jars into the pot using a holder. Leave a 2-inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary until the water level is at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring water to a full boil, cover the pot, and process for 10 minutes.
