## Ingredients

- 1 cup brown basmati rice, rinsed
- 2 ½ cups low-sodium chicken broth
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2  carrots, sliced
- 1  shallot, sliced
- 1 clove garlic, sliced, or to taste
- 2 (8 ounce) frozen skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- 2 teaspoons lemon pepper seasoning
- ¼ cup chopped cilantro

## Instructions

1. Pour rinsed rice into the bottom of a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®). Stir in broth, olive oil, and salt. Add carrots, shallot, and garlic. Place frozen chicken breasts on top, about 2 inches apart. Sprinkle lemon pepper seasoning over everything.
2. Close and lock the lid. Select Poultry function, or high pressure, according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 12 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
3. Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions for 5 minutes. Release any remaining pressure carefully using the quick-release method. Unlock and remove the lid. Check the temperature of the chicken breasts at the thickest section; an instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
4. Remove the chicken breasts and fluff the rice with a fork. Place the rice and vegetables on a plate. Top with chicken breasts and sprinkle with cilantro before serving.
