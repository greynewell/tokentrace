## Ingredients

- 2 pounds dried black-eyed peas
- 12 cups water
- 8 cubes  chicken bouillon
- 1 pound bacon
- ½ cup butter
- 2 large yellow onions, chopped
- 1 pound cooked ham, cut into bite-size pieces
- salt and black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Rinse, pick over, and place peas in a large bowl. Cover with several inches of cool water; let stand 8 hours to overnight. Drain and rinse.
2. Pour water into a large saucepan or stockpot. Add bouillon cubes and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally to dissolve bouillon. Stir in peas; reduce heat and bring to a simmer.
