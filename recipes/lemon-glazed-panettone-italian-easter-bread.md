## Ingredients

- 1 cup warm water (105 to115 degrees F/40 to 45 degrees C)
- 2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
- 4 ½ cups all-purpose flour, divided
- ½ cup unsalted butter
- ¾ cup white sugar, divided
- 2 large eggs
- 2 teaspoons grated lemon zest
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ¼ cup golden raisins
- ½ cup slivered almonds
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted, or more as needed
- 1 ½ cups powdered sugar, sifted
- ¼ cup freshly squeezed lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Combine warm water and yeast in a medium bowl. Let stand for 5 minutes.
2. Stir in 1 cup flour. Cover the bowl and let rise in a warm place for 30 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, beat butter in a large bowl until soft. Gradually add 1/2 cup sugar and blend until light and creamy. Beat in eggs, one at a time. Mix in lemon zest and salt. Beat in flour-yeast mixture that was resting, along with raisins.
4. Gradually add remaining 3 1/2 cups flour, then beat dough for 5 minutes. Cover the bowl with a clean cloth and let rise in a warm place until almost doubled, about 2 hours.
5. Generously grease two 9-inch tube pans. Punch down the risen dough and divide it in half. Place each half in a prepared tube pan and let rise until puffy, about 30 minutes.
6. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine almonds and remaining 1/4 cup sugar in a small bowl.
7. Lightly brush the tops of the panettone with melted butter and sprinkle almond-sugar mixture over top.
8. Bake in the preheated oven until golden, about 30 minutes.
9. While the panettone are baking, beat powdered sugar, lemon juice, and vanilla extract in a bowl until smooth. Spread glaze on the warm panettone.
