## Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon olive oil, or as needed
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- ¼ cup buttery spread (such as Smart Balance®), softened
- ¼ cup slivered almonds, crushed
- 3 tablespoons reduced-fat olive oil mayonnaise
- 2 tablespoons bread crumbs
- 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®)
- ¼ teaspoon dried basil
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ⅛ teaspoon onion powder
- ⅛ teaspoon celery salt
- 1 pound tilapia fillets

## Instructions

1. Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a broiling pan with aluminum foil or spray with olive oil cooking spray.
2. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir garlic until fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes.
3. Mix Parmesan cheese, garlic, buttery spread, almonds, mayonnaise, bread crumbs, lemon juice, seafood seasoning, basil, black pepper, onion powder, and celery salt together in a bowl.
4. Arrange tilapia fillets in a single layer on the prepared pan; cover pan with aluminum foil.
5. Broil in the preheated oven for 2 to 3 minutes. Flip fillets, cover pan with aluminum foil, and broil for 2 to 3 more minutes. Remove aluminum foil and cover fillets with Parmesan cheese mixture. Broil in the oven until fish flakes easily with a fork and topping is browned, about 2 more minutes.
