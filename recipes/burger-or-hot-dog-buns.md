## Ingredients

- 1 cup milk
- ½ cup water
- ¼ cup butter
- 4 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 (.25 ounce) package instant yeast
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt
- 1  egg

## Instructions

1. Heat milk, water, and butter in a small saucepan over medium heat until very warm, about 120 degrees F (50 degrees C).
2. Mix together 1 3/4 cups flour, sugar, yeast, and salt in a large bowl. Pour in warm milk mixture; stir until combined. Mix in egg. Add remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, beating well after each addition. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.
3. If making burger buns: Divide dough into 12 equal pieces. Shape into smooth balls; place on a greased baking sheet and flatten slightly. Cover and let rise for 30 to 35 minutes.
4. If making hot dog buns: Divide dough into 16 equal pieces. Shape each piece into a 6x4-inch rectangle. Starting with a long side, roll up tightly, then pinch edges and ends to seal. Place on a greased baking sheet. Cover and let rise for 20 to 25 minutes.
5. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
6. Bake buns in the preheated oven until golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes.
