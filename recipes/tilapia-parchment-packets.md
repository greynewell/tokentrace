## Ingredients

- 1 stick unsalted butter, softened
- 1 tablespoon basil pesto
- 7  sheets parchment paper
- 2 medium red potatoes, cut into thin strips
- 1  yellow squash, cut into thin strips
- 1  yellow onion, diced
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 6  tilapia fillets
- 1 pinch sea salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 6 tablespoons white wine

## Instructions

1. Mix butter and basil together until evenly combined. Spoon onto a piece of parchment paper and roll up tightly into a log. Refrigerate until firm, at least 4 hours.
2. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
3. Mix potatoes, squash, and onion together.
4. Cut each parchment paper sheet into a 15-inch square. Fold in half and trim edges to make a semi-circle. Unfold and place a handful of mixed vegetables on one half of each circle.
5. Drizzle 1 teaspoon olive oil over each tilapia fillet; season with salt and pepper. Position fillets over the vegetables and season with more salt and pepper. Place a couple slices of pesto butter and 1 tablespoon white wine over each fillet.
6. Fold empty half of parchment paper over the tilapia and vegetables, like a quesadilla. Twist the edges of the semi-circle to seal. Transfer to a baking sheet.
7. Bake in the preheated oven until tilapia flakes easily with a fork, about 20 minutes. Open parchment paper carefully and serve.
