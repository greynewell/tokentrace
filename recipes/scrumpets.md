## Ingredients

- 4 cups all-purpose flour, sifted
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 4 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup milk
- 3  eggs
- ½ cup butter, melted  (Optional)
- 1 teaspoon butter, or as needed  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Place flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a bowl and mix well.
2. Beat milk, eggs, and melted butter together in another bowl; stir into the flour mixture with a few strokes. Handle dough as little as possible.
3. Scrape the dough out onto a generously floured surface. Dip your fingers in flour and pat dough into a circle about 1/2-inch thick. Cut into 4-inch rounds to form the scrumpets.
4. Melt butter in a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Frying pan should be greased very lightly, preferably with butter. Fill pan with some scrumpets and immediately reduce heat to medium. Cook for 5 minutes. Turn, lower the heat, and cook for 5 minutes more. Cook remaining scrumpets and serve warm.
