## Instructions

1. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
2. Whisk shallot, red wine vinegar, white balsamic vinegar, garlic, lemon juice, Dijon mustard, parsley, chives, cilantro, and dill together in a large bowl. Slowly stream olive oil into the mixture while whisking vigorously until the oil is incorporated into a smooth and creamy dressing.
3. Arrange asparagus, corn, zucchini, yellow squash, green onions, bell pepper, and red onion onto baking sheets. Brush olive oil onto all the vegetables to coat; season with salt and pepper.

Cook vegetables directly on preheated grill, turning frequently, until slightly charred and just tender, about 5 minutes for green onions, 8 minutes for asparagus, zucchini, yellow squash, bell pepper, and red onion, and 10 minutes for corn. Remove vegetables to the baking sheets used for preparation and cool.
5. Cut asparagus, green onions, zucchini, yellow squash, and red bell pepper crosswise into 1-inch pieces and put into a large bowl. Quarter red onion slices; add to bowl. Cut corn kernels from cobs; add to bowl. Let vegetables cool to room temperature.
