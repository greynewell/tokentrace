## Ingredients

- 1 lb boneless skinless chicken breasts, sliced into strips
- 1 cup teriyaki sauce (Kikkoman recommended)
- 1 cup Italian dressing
- 1 cup ginger salad dressing (Mikato recommended)
- Cracked black pepper, to taste
- Garlic powder, to taste
- 1 tablespoon butter
- Sesame seeds, for garnish

## Instructions

1. Slice chicken breasts into even strips, about 1/2 inch thick. Wash thoroughly under cold water and pat completely dry with paper towels.
2. Season the sliced chicken lightly on both sides with cracked black pepper and garlic powder.
3. In a large bowl, combine the teriyaki sauce, Italian dressing, and ginger salad dressing. Stir to mix evenly.
4. Add the seasoned chicken to the marinade, making sure all pieces are fully submerged. Cover and refrigerate for at least 20 minutes, or up to overnight for deeper flavor.
5. Melt butter in a large skillet or pan over medium-high heat. Once the butter is foaming and the pan is hot, pour in the chicken along with the marinade.
6. Let the chicken cook undisturbed for several minutes until the underside is lightly blackened and caramelized. Flip the pieces and cook until the second side is also lightly blackened.
7. Flip once more to ensure even cooking. Slice into the thickest piece to check doneness — the meat should be white all the way through with no pink remaining in the center.
8. Transfer to a serving plate and top with a generous sprinkle of sesame seeds.

## Notes

Serve with miso soup, steamed rice, and Teriyaki Roasted Broccoli for a complete meal. For the marinade, Kikkoman teriyaki sauce and Mikato ginger dressing are the go-to brands — any Italian dressing works fine. The longer you marinate, the more flavor you get; overnight in the fridge is ideal if you have time.
