## Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon ground oregano
- 1 teaspoon all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ teaspoon Italian seasoning
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon onion powder
- ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1 pound ground beef
- 1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk
- ¾ cup white sugar
- 2 teaspoons garlic powder
- 4 teaspoons white vinegar, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Make loaf: Mix together salt, oregano, flour, black pepper, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne pepper in a cup or small bowl.
3. Place ground beef in a large steel mixing bowl on a sturdy surface; use your hands to blend in spice mixture. Pick up meat and throw it down with force about 20 times, kneading it after each throw. This will help meat hold together better when sliced.
4. Form meat into a loaf; place on a broiler pan or baking sheet.
5. Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour and 15 minutes, rotating loaf halfway through to ensure even baking. Serve warm with sauce or allow meat to chill before slicing and reheating.
6. Make sauce: Mix together evaporated milk, sugar, and garlic powder in a medium bowl. Gradually whisk in white vinegar, 1 teaspoon at a time, until thickened to your desired consistency.
