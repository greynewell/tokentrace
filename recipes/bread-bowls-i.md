## Ingredients

- 2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 1 ¾ cups warm water (110 degrees F)
- 2 cups whole wheat flour
- 2 cups bread flour
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1  egg white
- 2 tablespoons water

## Instructions

1. In a small mixing bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar  in warm water.

3. In a large mixing bowl, combine the yeast mixture with the whole wheat flour, salt and one cup of the bread flour; stir well to combine.
4. Add the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring well after each addition.
5. When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and supple, about 8 minutes.
6. Place into a lightly oiled bowl, and turn to coat the whole surface with oil.
7. Cover, and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes.
8. Punch down the dough, and let rest 10 minutes.
9. Divide into 4 balls.
10. Place on cookie sheets, and flatten into disks.
11. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes.
12. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
13. Lightly beat the egg white with the water and brush the risen loaves with this mixture.
14. Bake at 375 degree F (190 degree C) for 40 to 50 minutes.
15. When done bread should sound hollow when thumped on bottom.
16. Remove from oven, and let cool.
17. Cut a circle out of the top of each loaf, and remove that part of the crust.
18. Either remove the soft bread beneath, or compress it to form a bowl.
