## Ingredients

- ½ cup white sugar
- ¼ cup margarine, melted
- ¾ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ½ cup milk
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- ¼ cup margarine, melted
- ½ cup white sugar
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 24 mini-muffin cups.
