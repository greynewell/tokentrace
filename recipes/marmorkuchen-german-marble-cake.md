## Ingredients

- 1 ⅛ cups unsalted butter, softened
- 1 ¼ cups white sugar
- 2 teaspoons vanilla sugar
- 4 large eggs, at room temperature
- 4 cups all-purpose flour
- 5 teaspoons baking powder
- ½ cup milk
- 2 tablespoons dark rum
- 1 medium lemon, zested
- 2 ½ tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a large Kugelhopf or Bundt® cake pan with butter.
2. Beat butter with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and creamy. Slowly add sugar and vanilla sugar while beating constantly. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat for 5 minutes until batter is light and fluffy.
3. Sift flour and baking powder together in a separate bowl. Gradually mix flour mixture into the cake batter, alternating with the milk. Add rum and lemon zest. Pour 2/3 of the batter into the prepared pan.
4. Stir cocoa powder into the remaining batter until fully incorporated. Pour chocolate batter over the vanilla batter in the pan. Gently move a knife up and down through the batter in circular movements to create a marbled effect.
5. Bake cake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 50 to 60 minutes. Let cool slightly in the pan. Remove and place on a cooling rack to cool completely.
