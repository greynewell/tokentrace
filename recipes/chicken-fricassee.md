## Ingredients

- 12  chicken thighs
- 2 (12 ounce) packages andouille sausage, sliced

- 8 cups water
- 5 stalks celery, chopped
- 2 tablespoons Cajun seasoning
- 2 teaspoons cayenne pepper

## Instructions

1. Saute chicken and sausage in a large skillet for 4 to 5 minutes. Remove meat from skillet, add green onions and onion and saute until soft. Set aside.
