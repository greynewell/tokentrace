## Ingredients

- 3 cups frozen bite-size potato nuggets (such as Ore-Ida® Crispy Crowns®)
- 3 tablespoons butter, melted
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
- ¾ cup diced ham
- ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 4  eggs
- 1 ¼ cups milk
- ⅓ cup diced onion
- ⅓ cup diced green bell pepper
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon onion powder
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Make the crust: Place potato nuggets in a large microwave-safe bowl. Heat in the microwave until thawed, 1 to 2 minutes. Add butter and salt; mash together until potato nuggets are crumbled. Press evenly into a glass pie dish.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.
4. Remove crust from the oven. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
5. Make the filling: Combine Cheddar cheese, ham, Parmesan cheese, and flour in a bowl.
6. Whisk eggs in a separate bowl until smooth. Stir in milk, onion, bell pepper, salt, onion powder, and garlic powder. Pour into Cheddar mixture and stir filling until well combined. Pour filling over crust.
7. Bake in the preheated oven until filling is set and golden, about 45 minutes.
8. Remove from the oven and let cool for 10 to 15 minutes before slicing.
