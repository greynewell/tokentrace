## Ingredients

- ¾ cup brown sugar
- 3 tablespoons butter, softened
- 2  eggs
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon baking soda
- 1 (8.5 ounce) can crushed pineapple
- ¾ cup chopped pecans
- ½ cup raisins
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch loaf pan.
2. Beat brown sugar and butter with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, blending the first into the brown sugar mixture before adding the other.
3. Sift flour, baking powder, salt, and baking soda together in a separate bowl. Stir about half the flour mixture into the brown sugar mixture. Pour pineapple with its juice into the brown sugar mixture and stir; add remaining flour mixture and stir just until a batter forms. Fold pecans and raisins into the batter; pour into prepared loaf pan.
4. Mix white sugar and cinnamon together in a small bowl; sprinkle over the batter in the loaf pan.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 60 to 70 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
