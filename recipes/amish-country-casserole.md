## Ingredients

- 1 pound lean ground beef
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 1 medium green bell pepper, diced
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon black pepper
- 1 (8 ounce) package uncooked egg noodles
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can petite diced tomatoes
- 1 (10.75 ounce) can  condensed tomato soup, undiluted
- 1 cup cottage cheese
- 1 cup sour cream
- 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
- 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Combine ground beef, onion, and bell pepper in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir until vegetables are tender and beef is browned and cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Season mixture with salt and pepper while cooking.
3. Meanwhile, fill a 5-quart Dutch oven or other oven-safe pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rapid boil. Cook egg noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, 7 to 9 minutes. Drain noodles and return to the pot.
4. Add diced tomatoes, condensed soup, cottage cheese, sour cream, and Worcestershire sauce to the egg noodles; stir to blend. Stir in ground beef mixture until evenly combined. Taste and adjust seasonings. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese over the top.
5. Bake uncovered in the preheated oven until heated through and cheese is melted and golden, 25 to 30 minutes. Serve immediately.
