## Ingredients

- 1 cup self-rising flour
- 2 tablespoons rice flour
- ¼ teaspoon baking powder
- 4 (6 ounce) cod fillets, fully thawed if frozen
- 2 tablespoons rice flour, or as needed
- salt to taste
- 1 cup lager-style beer, or more as needed
- vegetable oil for frying

## Instructions

1. Whisk self-rising flour, rice flour, and baking powder together in a bowl. Freeze until ready to use.
2. Pat fish as dry as possible. Cut pieces lengthwise to get eight 1-inch thick strips. Place rice flour on a plate and season with salt. Dust fish lightly with the mixture and shake off excess. Cover a plate with crinkled foil to make a quick drying rack; place fish on top.
3. Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
4. Pour beer into the flour mixture and whisk, adding more as needed, until batter is the consistency of thick pancake batter. Dip fish pieces into the batter to coat; lift out and let excess drip off.
5. Fry fish in batches until golden brown, dunking occasionally if needed, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Serve immediately.
