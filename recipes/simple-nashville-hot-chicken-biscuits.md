## Ingredients

- 1 (16 ounce) can 8-count jumbo refrigerator biscuits
- ½ cup buttermilk
- 1  egg
- 2 tablespoons sriracha sauce
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- ½ cup all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons chicken and pork rub (such as Adkins®)
- 1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts, thinly sliced into 8 pieces
- ½ cup cooking oil
- 1 tablespoon butter

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place biscuits 1 inch apart on an ungreased baking sheet.
