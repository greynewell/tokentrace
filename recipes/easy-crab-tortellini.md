## Ingredients

- 7  saltine crackers, finely crushed
- 1 large egg, beaten
- 2 tablespoons mascarpone cheese
- ½ teaspoon Dijon mustard
- ¼ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
- 6 ounces lump crabmeat, very well drained, squeezed dry
- 6 ounces Dungeness crabmeat, very well drained, squeezed dry
- ¼ teaspoon seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®)
- salt to taste
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper
- 1 tablespoon minced jalapeno pepper
- 28  (3.5 inch square) wonton wrappers, or as needed
- 1 ½ cups creme fraiche
- 1 teaspoon ground paprika
- 2 teaspoons fresh lemon zest
- salt to taste
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill, or more to taste
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper

## Instructions

1. Crush crackers into a bowl. Add egg, mascarpone cheese, Dijon mustard, and Worcestershire sauce; stir until combined. Let sit until crumbs have absorbed some moisture, about 5 minutes.
2. Add crab meat, seafood seasoning, salt, cayenne pepper, and jalapeno to the cracker mixture; stir until just combined. Wrap and chill in the refrigerator until flavors develop, about 1 hour.
3. Place a wonton wrapper on a work surface to resemble a diamond shape. Wet the top 2 edges with just enough water to moisten. Place 1 tablespoon crab filling right in the center and press to spread it out a bit. Pull the bottom wonton corner up and over the filling, line it up with the top corner to form a triangle, and work your way down the sides, pressing and sealing the wonton edges and pushing out any air. Press your finger right in the center of the long side to create a fold (or bend) in the triangle. Moisten the 2 "wings" and fold around the bend to seal. Repeat to form remaining tortellini.
4. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil.
5. While waiting for water to boil, place creme fraiche in a skillet over medium heat. Add paprika, lemon zest, salt, and a splash of the pasta water. Cook and stir until heated through and just starting to simmer, then turn off the heat and reserve.
6. Add tortellini to the boiling water, giving a gentle stir make sure they don't stick to the bottom. Cook for 1 minute; they may or may not float to the surface. Remove tortellini with a slotted spoon and transfer into the reserved sauce.
7. Turn heat to medium-high and cook, gently stirring and basting, until sauce is heated through and just starts to simmer. Don't overcook or the sauce will reduce too much. Turn off the heat and stir in dill. Serve immediately on warm plates and sprinkle with additional dill and cayenne.
