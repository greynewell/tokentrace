## Ingredients

- 8  chicken tenders
- 1 tablespoon BBQ rub (such as McCormick®)
- 8 slices center-cut bacon, cut in half lengthwise
- 2 tablespoons honey
- 1 teaspoon water

## Instructions

1. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
2. Season chicken tenders with BBQ rub. Wrap each tender with 2 thin strips of bacon, tucking in the ends to secure.
3. Mix together honey and water in a small bowl. Set aside.
4. Place chicken tenders on the preheated grill and reduce heat to medium-low. Close lid and grill tenders, turning every 2 to 3 minutes, until bacon is browned and chicken has reached an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit (73 degrees C), 12 to 14 minutes. For crispier bacon, increase heat during the last 2 minutes of cooking.
5. Move tenders to indirect heat and brush with honey mixture. Transfer to a plate and serve.
