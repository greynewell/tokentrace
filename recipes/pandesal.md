## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups warm milk
- ¾ cup white sugar, divided
- 1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
- 4 cups bread flour
- 2 teaspoons salt
- ¼ cup vegetable oil
- 1 cup bread crumbs

## Instructions

1. Combine milk, 2 teaspoons sugar, and yeast in a large bowl; stir until sugar and yeast are fully dissolved, about 5 minutes.
2. Mix remaining sugar, flour, and salt together in a large bowl. Pour in milk mixture and vegetable oil. Mix until dough comes together.
3. Turn dough out onto a flat work surface. Knead until smooth. Shape into a ball and return to the bowl. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise until doubled, at least 1 hour.
4. Divide dough into 4 equal portions using a bench knife. Roll each portion into a log; slice diagonally into 1-inch pieces.
5. Pour bread crumbs onto a large plate. Roll each piece of dough in bread crumbs and place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Let rise until puffy, 30 to 45 minutes.
6. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
7. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.
