## Ingredients

- 6 tablespoons water
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 2 cups all-purpose flour, sifted
- ¼ cup margarine, melted
- 1 teaspoon vegetable oil, or as needed
- 2 medium potatoes, peeled and cubed
- ¼ cup salted butter
- 2 medium onions, chopped
- 2 stalks green onions, finely chopped
- 1 ½ medium red bell peppers, seeded and chopped
- ⅔ pound ground beef
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 3 large hard-boiled eggs, peeled and chopped

## Instructions

1. Combine water and salt in a small saucepan over medium heat and warm through, stirring until salt is dissolved. Remove from heat and let cool for 2 to 3 minutes.
2. Combine sifted flour and melted margarine in the bowl of a food processor; pulse until crumbly. Add salt water gradually to the food processor and pulse until a soft dough ball forms that easily separates from the edge of the bowl. Add more water, 1 teaspoon at a time, only if needed. Press dough into a ball and wrap tightly with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
3. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Cover a baking sheet with aluminum foil and grease with vegetable oil. Set aside.
4. Bring a saucepan of water to a boil. Add cubed potatoes and cook until soft, 8 to 10 minutes.
5. Meanwhile, melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onions and green onions until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add red peppers and cook for 5 more minutes. Add ground beef and stir with a wooden spoon until fully browned, about 5 minutes. Season with salt, cayenne pepper, cumin, and paprika. Remove from heat.
6. Drain potatoes and add to the filling. Toss in chopped eggs and let filling cool down for a few minutes.
7. Remove pastry from the fridge and knead gently on a floured surface. Divide dough in half and roll out each piece to 1/8-inch thickness.
8. Cut out 3-inch circles with a pastry cutter or sharp knife and wet the edges lightly with water. Add 1 large tablespoon of filling in the center of each disc. Fold the pastry over, press edges together, and seal with a fork. Transfer empanadas to the prepared baking sheet.
9. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool just a little before serving.
