## Ingredients

- 2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 (3.4 ounce) package instant pumpkin-spice pudding mix (such as Jello®)
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¾ cup softened butter
- ½ cup canned pumpkin
- ½ cup white sugar

- 2  eggs
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 cup white chocolate chips
- 1 (14 ounce) package pumpkin-spice flavored candy-coated milk chocolate pieces (such as M&Ms®)

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Combine flour, pudding mix, baking soda, pumpkin pie spice, and salt in a bowl.
3. Combine butter, pumpkin, white sugar, and brown sugar in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until fluffy. Beat in eggs, honey, and vanilla extract until incorporated.
