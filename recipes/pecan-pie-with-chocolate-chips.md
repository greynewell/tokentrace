## Ingredients

- 1 (15 ounce) package pie crusts
- 5 large eggs
- 1 cup light corn syrup
- ½ cup brown sugar
- ½ cup white sugar
- ½ cup shortening (such as Crisco®)
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
- 3 teaspoons instant espresso powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 (12 ounce) bag dark chocolate chips (such as Ghirardelli®)
- 1 ½ cups pecans

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line two 9-inch pie plates with pie crusts; fold excess dough to form a rim and flute as desired.
2. Mix eggs, corn syrup, brown sugar, white sugar, shortening, flour, espresso powder, and salt together in a bowl.
3. Layer 1/2 of the chocolate chips on the bottom of each pie crust. Divide batter evenly between the 2 pies, covering the chocolate chips completely. Lay whole pecans on top in concentric circles or chop pecans and press under batter. Cover with aluminum foil so as not to overcook pecans.
4. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Uncover and continue to bake until set, about 30 minutes more. Remove from the oven and let cool completely, about 30 minutes. Chill for at least 1 hour before serving.
