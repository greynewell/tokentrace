## Ingredients

- 1 (3 pound) whole filet of salmon, skin on, scored (up to but not through the skin)  into serving pieces
- 6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 4 large garlic cloves, minced
- ¼ cup minced fresh dill
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon lemon zest, plus lemon wedges for serving

## Instructions

1. Soak an untreated cedar plank (or planks) large enough to hold a side of salmon (5 to 7 inches wide and 16 to 20 inches long) in water, weighting it with something heavy, like a brick, so it stays submerged 30 minutes to 24 hours.
2. When ready to grill, either build a charcoal fire in half the grill or turn grill burners on high for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, mix oil, garlic, dill, salt, pepper and lemon zest; rub over salmon and into scored areas to coat.
3. Place soaked cedar on hot grill grate, close lid, and watch until wood starts to smoke, about 5 minutes. Transfer salmon to hot plank, move salmon off direct charcoal heat or turn burners to low, and cook covered until salmon is just opaque throughout (130 on a meat thermometer inserted in the thickest section) 20 to 25 minutes or longer, depending on thickness and grill temperature. Let sit 5 minutes; serve with lemon wedges.
