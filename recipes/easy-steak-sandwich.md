## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons butter
- ¼ medium onion, sliced
- 4 large fresh mushrooms, sliced
- ¼  green bell pepper, sliced into long strips
- 1 (1/2 pound) well-marbled beef steak of any type, sliced as thinly as possible
- 3 tablespoons chopped pickled hot peppers
- 1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce
- 2 slices sharp Cheddar cheese
- salt and pepper to taste
- ⅓  French baguette, cut in half lengthwise

## Instructions

1. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until just tender, about 2 minutes. Push onion to sides of the pan; add mushrooms and cook until softened. Stir in bell pepper and cook just until tender, about 3 minutes. Remove vegetables from the pan with a slotted spoon; set aside.
2. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon butter in the same skillet. Add steak and pickled hot peppers; season with hot pepper sauce, salt, and pepper. Cook and stir until steak is mostly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Add vegetable mixture back into the pan; stir until heated through.
3. Turn off the heat; place cheese on top of steak and vegetable mixture so it can melt. Scoop mixture into sliced baguette; pour some of the juices on top.
