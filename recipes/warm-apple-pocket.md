## Ingredients

- 3  sweet apples -- peeled, cored and thinly sliced
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 2 tablespoons flour
- pinch of salt
- 1 teaspoon apple pie spice
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- 1 (15 ounce) package prepared, unbaked pie crust, thawed
- milk
- 1  egg, beaten

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. In a bowl, toss apple slices together with sugar, flour, salt, apple pie spice, and vanilla extract until evenly coated.
3. Lay pie dough flat on a lightly greased baking sheet. Pile apples on one side of dough, leaving a 1 inch border. Brush border and opposite half side of dough with milk. Fold dough over apples, being careful not to over-stuff or the dough will tear. Fold over edges and pinch together to seal. Cut several small slits in the top of the pocket with a sharp knife, then brush top with beaten egg.
