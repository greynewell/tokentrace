## Ingredients

- 1 pound bacon
- ½ cup butter
- 1  onion, sliced thin
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 (4 ounce) package fresh mushrooms, sliced
- 1 cup white wine
- 2 cups chicken stock
- 1 (14 ounce) package seasoned stuffing cubes
- 1 (10 ounce) jar oysters, drained and cut into thirds

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Place bacon in a large, deep skillet; cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown. Remove bacon to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Reserve drippings in the skillet.
3. Add the butter to the bacon drippings and melt over medium-high heat. Cook the onion, garlic, and mushrooms in the butter and drippings until the onion has caramelized, 10 to 15 minutes. Pour the wine into the skillet; allow the wine to warm; remove from heat.
4. Place the stuffing cubes in a large bowl. Pour the vegetable mixture over the cubes. Add the chicken stock. Fold the oysters into the mixture. Transfer the stuffing to a 9x13 inch baking dish.
