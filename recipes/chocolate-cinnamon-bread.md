## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 ¼ cups Dutch-processed unsweetened cocoa powder
- 3 tablespoons ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- 1 cup buttermilk
- ¼ cup water
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 ½ cups unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 3 cups white sugar
- 5 large eggs, at room temperature

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 9x5-inch loaf pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper.
2. Sift flour, cocoa powder, cinnamon, salt, baking powder, and baking soda together into a bowl. Whisk buttermilk, water, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl.
3. Combine butter and sugar in a third, large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until light and creamy, about 5 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, beating after each addition until egg is completely incorporated. Add flour mixture in 3 batches, alternating with buttermilk mixture, beating batter briefly after each addition until just blended. Divide batter evenly between the prepared loaf pans.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Run a table knife around the edges to loosen. Invert carefully onto a serving plate or cooling rack. Let cool completely.
