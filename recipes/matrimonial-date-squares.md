## Ingredients

- 1 pound pitted dates
- ⅔ cup light brown sugar
- ⅔ cup orange juice
- 1  orange, zested
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 ½ cups regular rolled oats
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 cup light brown sugar
- ¾ teaspoon baking soda
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¾ cup cold unsalted butter

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Heat dates, 2/3 cup brown sugar, orange juice, and orange zest in a saucepan over low heat; cook, stirring occasionally, until dates have softened, absorbed the liquid, and mixture is like a paste, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in vanilla extract.
3. Stir oats, flour, 1 cup brown sugar, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl; cut in butter with a knife or pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
4. Lightly press 2/3 of the crumb mixture into the bottom of a 9x9-inch pan. Spread date mixture evenly over the crumb crust; sprinkle remaining crumbs evenly over the top of date mixture.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until top is golden, about 30 minutes; cool on a wire rack for at least 1 hour before slicing into bars.
