## Ingredients

- 5 cups gluten-free all-purpose flour (such as King Arthur®)
- 1  lemon, zested
- ½  orange, zested
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ⅓ cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 6 jumbo eggs
- ½ cup cane sugar
- 2 quarts vegetable oil for frying, or as needed
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- 2 cups honey
- ¼ cup multi-colored sprinkles, or more to taste

## Instructions

1. Combine flour, lemon zest, orange zest, baking powder, and salt together in a food processor; pulse to combine. Mix eggs and sugar together in a separate bowl; add 1/3 cup olive oil and vanilla extract and beat again. Mix together with flour mixture using hands to knead.
2. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Heat frying oil in a deep saucepan over medium heat until the temperature reaches 375 degrees F (190 degrees C), about 5 minutes.
3. Transfer dough to a floured work surface; continue to knead sticky dough with floured hands. Flatten dough into a thin loaf about 10 inches long. Cut long ropes from the loaf, then slice ropes into 1/2-inch pieces and transfer to the prepared baking sheet.
4. Fry dough pieces in batches in the hot oil until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels.
5. Heat honey in a saucepan until warm and fluid, about 1 minute. Pour hot honey over struffoli and toss to coat. Sprinkle with multi-colored sprinkles.
