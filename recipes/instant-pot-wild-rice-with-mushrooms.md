## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- ½ (8 ounce) package baby portobello mushrooms

## Instructions

1. Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot) and select the sauté function. Heat olive oil until hot, then add mushrooms, onion, celery, carrot, and garlic. Cook, occasionally stirring, until vegetables soften, about 3 minutes. Turn the pressure cooker off.
