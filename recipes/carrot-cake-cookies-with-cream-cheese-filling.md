## Ingredients

- 2 cups white sugar
- 1 cup packed light brown sugar
- 1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 2 each eggs
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ½ teaspoon ground ginger
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 2 cups old-fashioned rolled oats
- 1 ½ cups finely grated carrots

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.
2. Combine white sugar, brown sugar, and butter for cookies in a mixing bowl. Beat until light and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Add eggs and vanilla extract and mix on medium speed until well combined.
3. Sift flour, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and salt together in a bowl. Mix into butter mixture on low speed until well combined. Mix in oats and carrots, followed by raisins and walnuts.
4. Chill for 1 hour in the refrigerator.
5. Scoop batter onto the prepared baking sheets using a tablespoon-sized scoop, leaving about 2 inches between cookies.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until edges are set, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool on a wire rack.
7. Beat cream cheese in a mixing bowl to soften. Add butter and mix until combined. Beat in confectioners' sugar, followed by vanilla extract. Beat 30 seconds more to lighten.
8. Spread frosting onto one cooled cookie. Sandwich together with another. Repeat with remaining cookies.
