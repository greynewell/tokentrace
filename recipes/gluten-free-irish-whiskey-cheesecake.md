## Ingredients

- 6 ounces gluten-free oatmeal cookies
- 1 tablespoon firmly packed dark brown sugar
- ¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 3 ½ tablespoons very cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
- 24 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature
- 1 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar
- 2 ½ tablespoons firmly packed dark brown sugar
- 4  eggs, at room temperature
- 2 tablespoons coffee-flavored liqueur (such as Kahlua®)
- 2 teaspoons coffee-flavored liqueur (such as Kahlua®)
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- 5 teaspoons instant espresso powder
- 7 tablespoons Irish whiskey
- ¾ teaspoon instant espresso powder
- ½ teaspoon white sugar
- 1 tablespoon heavy whipping cream
- 1 ½ cups chilled heavy whipping cream
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 10  chocolate-covered espresso beans, or as desired

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly butter a 9-inch springform pan. Wrap the pan in a double layer of heavy duty aluminum foil, securely wrapping it around the pan.
2. Combine cookies, 1 tablespoon dark brown sugar, and cinnamon in a food processor; finely grind. Add butter and process until crumbs hold together. Press mixture into the prepared pan, covering the bottom and extending 1 1/2 inches up the sides.
3. Bake crust in the preheated oven until crust darkens slightly, about 8 minutes. Remove from the oven. Let crust cool completely, about 30 minutes.
4. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
5. Blend cream cheese and sugar in a food processor until smooth, scraping down sides of bowl occasionally. Mix in 1 egg, 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons coffee liqueur, and vanilla extract. Dissolve espresso powder in Irish whiskey in a large bowl. Stir in cream cheese mixture. Whisk in remaining eggs 1 at a time. Pour filling into the cooled crust.
6. Place the filled springform pan into a large, deep baking pan. Add 1 inch of hot water to the outer pan.
7. Bake in the hot oven until outer 2 inches of cake are firm and slightly puffed, about 45 minutes; center will appear moist and edges may crack slightly. Remove springform pan from the water and place on a wire rack; let cool to room temperature, about 1 hour. Refrigerate cake in the pan until well chilled, about 2 hours more. Cover pan with plastic wrap and let cake mellow for 1 to 2 days.
8. Dissolve espresso powder and 1/2 teaspoon sugar in 1 tablespoon cream in a small bowl. Beat 1 1/2 cups chilled cream and 2 tablespoons sugar together in a large bowl until soft peaks form. Fold in espresso mixture. Remove plastic wrap and pan sides from the cake. Serve topped with the whipped topping and garnished with chocolate-covered espresso beans.
