## Ingredients

- 1 (12 ounce) package extra-firm tofu, drained
- ¼ cup cornstarch
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon vegetarian chicken-flavored bouillon granules
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- ½ cup unsweetened soy milk
- 2 tablespoons canola oil
- ½ cup cayenne pepper hot sauce  (Optional)
- ⅓ cup margarine, melted

## Instructions

1. Slice tofu into 6 slices. Lay flat onto a clean kitchen towel. Fold towel over to cover tofu completely. Cover with a baking sheet and set a 3- to 5-pound weight on top. Press tofu for about 30 minutes.
2. Combine cornstarch, flour, bouillon, garlic powder, and cayenne powder in a shallow bowl. Pour soy milk into another bowl.
3. Cut each slice of tofu in half, for 12 'wings' total. Dip each slice in soy milk; roll into the cornstarch mixture. Place coated slices on a plate.
4. Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the coated tofu slices. Fry, flipping halfway, until crispy on all sides, 7 to 10 minutes total. Add hot sauce and margarine to the saucepan and stir to coat the tofu.
