## Ingredients

- 1 cup lukewarm milk
- 1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
- 1 large egg
- 2 tablespoons butter, softened
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 3 cups bread flour, or more as needed
- ¾ cup chocolate chips
- ¾ cup dried cherries

## Instructions

1. Mix milk and yeast in a small bowl with a fork until frothy, about 5 minutes. Add egg, butter, white sugar, brown sugar, vanilla extract, and salt. Beat for 1 to 2 minutes. Add 1 cup flour. Beat for about 5 minutes. Add remaining 2 cups flour; mix until dough comes together.
2. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Knead until dough is smooth and feels rubbery, about 10 minutes. Add additional flour if needed. Add chocolate chips and cherries; knead just until incorporated.
3. Cover dough and let rise in a warm, humid area until doubled, about 1 hour.
4. Punch down dough gently. Let rest for 10 minutes. Divide dough in half; shape into loaves. Transfer loaves to a greased baking sheet and let rise again, about 1 hour more.
5. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
6. Bake in the preheated oven until browned, 20 to 30 minutes.
