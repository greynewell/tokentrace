## Ingredients

- 1 pound chicken livers, rinsed and trimmed
- 1 cup milk
- ½ cup unsalted butter
- 2 large onions, thinly sliced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary
- 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme
- 2  bay leaves
- ½ cup dry white wine
- 2 tablespoons drained capers

## Instructions

1. Stir together the chicken livers and milk in a bowl.
2. Set aside to soak for 2 hours, then drain and discard the milk.
