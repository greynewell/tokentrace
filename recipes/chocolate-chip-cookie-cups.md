## Ingredients

- 2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt

- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 large eggs
- 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 mini muffin pans.
2. Combine flour, baking soda, and salt in a small bowl.
