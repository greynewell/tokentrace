## Ingredients

- 1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 4 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
- ¼ cup whole milk, or more as needed
- 1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract
- cooking spray
- 5 tablespoons confectioners' sugar
- 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice

## Instructions

1. Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Add butter and use a fork or pastry cutter to work butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse cornmeal.
2. Pour in milk and vanilla and combine until liquid is evenly distributed. Add additional milk, 1 tablespoon at a time, if dough does not come together. Knead dough for 1 to 2 minutes.
3. Preheat an air fryer to 320 degrees F (160 degrees C). Lightly spray the basket with cooking spray.
4. Divide dough into 12 equal portions and set 6 portions into the basket without touching. Lightly spray with cooking spray.
5. Air fry for 5 minutes, lightly spray again, then fry for an additional 2 minutes. Transfer donut holes to a wire rack and repeat with remaining 6 portions.
6. Stir confectioners' sugar and lemon juice together in a very small bowl until well mixed. Drizzle lemon glaze over the donut holes and serve warm.
