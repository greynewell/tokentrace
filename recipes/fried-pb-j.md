## Ingredients

- 2 stalks fresh rhubarb, diced
- ¼ cup white sugar
- ½  lemon, juiced
- 2 tablespoons honey, or more to taste
- 1 tablespoon water
- ½ cup sliced strawberries, or to taste
- ½ cup peanut butter
- 2 (8 ounce) packages refrigerated crescent roll dough
- 1 cup vegetable oil, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Combine rhubarb, sugar, lemon juice, honey, and water together in a saucepan over high heat; cook and stir until rhubarb softens to a pulp, 5 to 10 minutes. Add strawberries and cook until strawberries fall apart and most of the liquid is dissolved, about 5 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat and cool jam for 10 minutes.
2. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Measuring out in 1/2 tablespoons, spoon 14 portions of jam and 14 portions of peanut butter onto the prepared baking sheet. Cover baking sheet with plastic wrap and freeze until fillings are solid, 3 hours to overnight.
3. Roll dough onto a lightly floured piece of parchment paper, pressing dough together at the seams. Seal the seams together and slightly flatten dough by rolling a lightly floured rolling pin over it. Cut 28 circles out of dough using a 2-inch cookie cutter. Arrange the circles on the parchment paper.
4. Place 1 jam and 1 peanut butter filling onto the center of 14 dough circles. Place a second circle of dough over the filling, rolling up the edges of the bottom circle and crimping together to seal. Arrange crescent pockets on a baking sheet and freeze.
5. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
6. Fry crescent pockets, 3 at a time, in the hot oil using a small wooden spoon to flip them continuously until golden, about 1 minute per side. Transfer pockets to a paper towel-lined plate.
