## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 large yellow onion, coarsely chopped
- 3 large cloves garlic, coarsely chopped
- 3  broccoli stalks, coarsely chopped
- 2  broccoli florets and stalks, coarsely chopped
- 2 large potatoes, peeled and coarsely chopped
- ⅓  celery root, coarsely chopped
- 4 cups low-sodium chicken stock

## Instructions

1. Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until translucent, 10 to 15 minutes. Add broccoli stalks, potatoes, broccoli florets, and celery root; toss until coated in oil. Cover vegetables with chicken stock; bring to a boil.
2. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are easily pierced with a fork, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove soup from heat.
