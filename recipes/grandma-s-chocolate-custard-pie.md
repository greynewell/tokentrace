## Ingredients

- ¾ cup white sugar
- 2 tablespoons self-rising flour
- 1 tablespoon cocoa powder, or more to taste
- 2 cups whole milk
- 2  eggs, separated
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1  pre-baked pie shell
- 1 pinch white sugar, or to taste
- 1 dash vanilla extract, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Mix sugar, flour, and cocoa powder together in a bowl until well combined.
2. Mix milk, egg yolks, and vanilla together in a separate large bowl. Add flour mixture and blend custard until smooth.
3. Pour custard into a cast iron skillet over medium heat. Cook, stirring continually, until slightly boiling but not popping, about 5 minutes. Cook just until reasonably thickened, 3 to 5 minutes more, and remove from heat immediately. Stir hot custard to smooth out any lumps and pour into the pre-baked pie shell.
4. Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
5. Combine egg whites, sugar, and vanilla for meringue in a small bowl. Beat with an electric mixer until peaks start to form. Spread meringue over custard.
6. Cook under the preheated broiler just until the peaks start to turn light brown, 1 to 2 minutes, being very careful not to let meringue burn.
7. Place the custard pie in the fridge or on Grandma's porch on a cool night until the custard congeals, about 2 hours.
