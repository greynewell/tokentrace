## Ingredients

- 1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed
- 1 ½ pounds mahi mahi
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 medium russet potato, peeled and cubed
- 3 stalks celery, halved lengthwise and sliced
- 1 large carrot, diced
- 2 medium leeks, halved lengthwise and sliced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons salted butter
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 cup milk
- 1 cup water
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ cup sour cream
- ½ medium lemon, juiced
- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- ¼ cup chopped fresh parsley
- ⅛ cup chopped fresh chives
- 1 medium egg, beaten

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Cut pastry into 6 rectangles and place on a baking sheet.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until puffed and golden, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven; leave the oven on.
4. Meanwhile, cut mahi mahi into 1 inch pieces. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper.
5. Heat olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add potato, celery, and carrot. Cook, stirring occasionally, until just tender, about 8 minutes. Add leeks and let soften, about 3 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add butter.
6. When butter has melted, add flour and whisk for 1 minute. Slowly whisk in milk and water, then add 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Bring to a boil.
7. Reduce heat to a simmer, and cook until mixture thickens slightly, 3 to 4 minutes. Whisk in sour cream, lemon juice, and Dijon. Add fish and cook over low heat until fish flakes easily with a fork, 7 to 8 minutes. Stir in parsley and chives and remove from the heat.
8. Transfer fish mixture to a 2-quart pastry dish. Place pastry rectangles on top, and brush each one with beaten egg.
9. Return to the oven and bake until pastry is puffed and golden brown and filling is bubbly, about 10 minutes. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving.
