## Ingredients

- 2  trout fillets
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons chopped green onion
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
- 2 cloves garlic, chopped
- ½ cup sliced mushrooms
- ⅓ cup white wine
- 1 ½ teaspoons lemon juice
- ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Arrange fillets in a large baking dish.
2. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir green onion, parsley, and garlic until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes.
