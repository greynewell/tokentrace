## Instructions

1. Place halved strawberries, zest from one lemon, juice from 2 lemons, water, honey, salt, and cayenne pepper in a pot over medium-high heat and bring to a simmer.

3. Remove from heat.

5. Preheat oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C).

11. Reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

13. Combine mustard and onions in a small bowl.
14. Pour melted butter into bread crumbs in a separate bowl; stir until mixture resembles wet sand.
15. Season with salt.
16. Coat top of lamb generously with the mustard mixture.
17. Sprinkle crumb mixture onto the mustard mixture and press down to create a crumb crust.
18. Roast rack until it reaches an internal temperature of 125 degrees F (50 degrees C), about 15 minutes.
