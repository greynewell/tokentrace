## Ingredients

- ⅓ cup Italian salad dressing
- ¼ cup water
- ¼ cup soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons honey
- 1 tablespoon liquid smoke flavoring
- 2 teaspoons garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 2 (2 1/2 pound) beef tri-tip roast

## Instructions

1. Whisk Italian dressing, water, soy sauce, honey, liquid smoke, garlic powder, salt, and red pepper flakes together in a bowl and pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add the roast, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 4 hours to overnight.
2. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Remove roast from the bag and discard marinade.
3. Place roast on the grill and reduce heat to medium-low; cook until desired doneness is reached, 35 to 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Allow roast to rest for 15 minutes under tented aluminum foil before cutting.
