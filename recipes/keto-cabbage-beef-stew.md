## Ingredients

- 3 pounds cubed beef stew meat
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 (32 ounce) carton no-salt-added beef broth
- 1 pound sliced fresh mushrooms
- 3  bay leaves
- 1 ½ pounds cabbage, diced, or more to taste
- 1 (15 ounce) can diced tomatoes
- 2 medium onions, chopped
- 1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
- 2 stalks celery, sliced

## Instructions

1. Season beef with salt and pepper. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook beef in batches until browned on at least 2 sides, about 5 minutes per batch. Avoid overcrowding the skillet so beef browns and doesn't steam.
2. Add browned beef, broth, mushrooms, and bay leaves to a large pot. Cover and simmer until beef is tender, at least 1 hour and up to 2 hours.
3. Add cabbage, diced tomatoes, onions, tomato paste, and celery. Cook for at least 1 hour more.
