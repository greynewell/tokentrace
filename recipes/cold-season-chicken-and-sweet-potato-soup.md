## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided, or as needed
- 4 medium carrots, chopped
- 1 large sweet potato, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
- 1 (32 ounce) carton low-sodium chicken broth, divided
- 1 cup chopped yellow onion
- 2 (8 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cubed
- 2 tablespoons minced garlic
- 3 sprigs fresh thyme
- 1 large sprig fresh rosemary
- ¼ cup water, or to taste
- ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add carrots and sweet potato; cook and stir for about 5 minutes, adding a splash of chicken broth if veggies begin to burn before they are soft. Add onion. Cover and cook, stirring every few minutes, until sweet potato is soft, about 5 more minutes.
2. While sweet potatoes are cooking, heat 1 tablespoon oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and saute until browned, 3 to 5 minutes, adding a dash of olive oil if needed. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add remaining chicken broth, thyme sprigs, and rosemary sprig. Add water if there is not enough broth.
3. Bring soup to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until all veggies are thoroughly cooked and flavors have melded together, 30 to 45 minutes.
4. Season with pepper and remove herb sprigs before serving.
