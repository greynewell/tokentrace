## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 3 tablespoons white sugar
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ¼ teaspoon ground cloves
- ¼ teaspoon ground ginger
- 6 tablespoons cold butter, cut into 1-inch squares
- ½ cup canned pumpkin
- 1 large egg
- 3 tablespoons half-and-half
- 1 cup powdered sugar, or as needed
- 2 tablespoons milk, or as needed
- 1 cup powdered sugar
- 2 tablespoons milk
- ¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1 pinch ground ginger
- 1 pinch ground cloves

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Combine flour, 1/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons sugar, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and ginger in the bowl of a stand mixer. Mix using the paddle attachment. Add butter to the bowl and toss using a spatula to ensure butter is coated in flour mixture. Mix until mixture resembles cornmeal with butter pieces no bigger than a pea, about 2 minutes.
3. Whisk pumpkin, egg, and half-and-half together in a bowl until blended. Fold pumpkin mixture into flour mixture until dough can be formed into a ball.
4. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface press with your hands into a long rectangle, 3/4- to 1-inch thick. Use a pizza cutter to cut dough into 4 rectangles. Cut each rectangle into 2 triangles. Place dough triangles onto the prepared baking sheet.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until scones begin to brown around the edges and on top, about 15 minutes.
6. Transfer scones to a wire rack to cool completely, about 20 minutes.
7. Mix powdered sugar and milk together in a small bowl, using more sugar or more milk to reach the desired consistency. Use a brush to spread glaze on the cooled scones. Allow to harden, about 10 minutes.
8. Meanwhile, mix powdered sugar, milk, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and cloves together in a small bowl. Drizzle spiced glaze over the first glaze and allow to harden completely, about 10 minutes more.
