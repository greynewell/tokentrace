## Ingredients

- 4 large potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks, or more to taste
- 4 large carrots, chopped, or more to taste
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- ½ stalk celery with leaves, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, chopped
- 2 tablespoons dried parsley
- 1 tablespoon dried basil
- 1 tablespoon beef bouillon powder
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- water as needed
- 1 pound lean ground beef

## Instructions

1. Combine potatoes, carrots, onion, celery, garlic, parsley, basil, bouillon, salt, and pepper in a large soup pot. Fill pot with enough water to cover ingredients. Cover and boil until all ingredients begin to soften, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from heat so you do not burn your hands.
2. Crumble in uncooked ground beef, a little at a time, stirring to mix a few times. Return to heat and bring back to a boil. Simmer on low to medium heat until all vegetables are cooked through and meat is no longer pink, 15 to 20 minutes.
