## Ingredients

- 2 cups panko bread crumbs
- ½ cup Italian-seasoned bread crumbs
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breast, cut into tender-size pieces
- 1 ½ cups Buffalo wing sauce

## Instructions

2. Combine panko bread crumbs, Italian-seasoned bread crumbs, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Pour Buffalo wing sauce into a separate bowl.
3. Coat chicken breast pieces on both sides with Buffalo sauce then evenly coat with bread crumb mixture. Lay pieces flat on a baking sheet.
