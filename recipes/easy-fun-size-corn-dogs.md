## Ingredients

- 4 frankfurter, (5 in long x 7/8 in dia, 8 per pound)s hot dogs
- 1 large egg, beaten
- 4 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 1 cup milk

1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
2. Cut each hot dog into 6 pieces.
3. Pour egg, 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, sugar, and milk into a mixing bowl; whisk until combined. Add white vinegar, cornmeal, flour, baking powder, baking soda, kosher salt, and cayenne.
