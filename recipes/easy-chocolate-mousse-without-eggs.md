## Ingredients

- ½ (12 ounce) bag semisweet chocolate chips, or more to taste
- 1 ½ cups heavy whipping cream, divided
- ¼ cup hot, strong coffee
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

3. Remove cover and slowly stir with a spatula until smooth. Stir in hot coffee and vanilla extract until all chocolate has melted.
