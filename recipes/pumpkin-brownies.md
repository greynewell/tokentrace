## Ingredients

- ¾ cup all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¾ cup butter, melted
- 1 ½ cups white sugar
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 3  eggs
- ¼ cup cocoa powder
- ½ cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
- ½ cup pumpkin puree
- ½ cup chopped walnuts
- ¾ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon ground cloves
- ½ teaspoon ground nutmeg

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking pan.
2. Stir flour, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl.
3. Stir sugar, melted butter, and vanilla together in a large bowl. Add one egg and mix with a spoon until well incorporated. Repeat to add remaining 2 eggs, mixing well after each addition. Gradually add flour mixture and stir the batter until evenly moistened. Pour 1/2 of the batter back into the medium bowl that held the flour mixture.
4. Stir chocolate chips and cocoa into one bowl of batter. Stir pumpkin puree, walnuts, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg into the second bowl of batter.
5. Spread 1/2 of the chocolate batter into the bottom of the prepared baking pan, and follow with 1/2 of the pumpkin batter. Repeat the two layers once more. Drag a kitchen knife or small spatula gently through the layers in a swirling motion to create a marbled appearance.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until the brownies begin to pull away from the sides of the pan, and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes.
7. Remove from the oven and let cool in the pan before cutting into 16 squares.
