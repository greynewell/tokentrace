## Ingredients

- ¼ cup mayonnaise
- 1 tablespoon Sriracha
- 1 pound skinless salmon fillets, cut into 1-inch pieces
- ⅓ cup almond flour
- 1  egg, lightly beaten
- 1 ½ teaspoons seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®)
- 1  green onion, coarsely chopped
- cooking spray
- 1 pinch seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®)  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Whisk together mayonnaise and Sriracha in a small bowl. Place 1 tablespoon Sriracha mayo in the bowl of a food processor and refrigerate the rest until ready to use.
2. Add salmon, almond flour, egg, 1 1/2 teaspoons seafood seasoning, and green onion to the Sriracha mayo; pulse quickly for 4 to 5 seconds until ingredients are just combined, but small chunks of salmon remain. (Do not overprocess as the mixture will become mushy.)
3. Line a plate with waxed paper and spray hands with cooking spray. Form the salmon mixture into 8 small patties; transfer to a plate. Place in the refrigerator until chilled and firm, about 15 minutes.
4. Preheat the air fryer to 390 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray the air fryer basket with cooking spray.
5. Remove salmon cakes from refrigerator. Mist both sides with cooking spray and gently place in the air fryer basket, working in batches if necessary to avoid overcrowding.
6. Cook in the preheated air fryer for 6 to 8 minutes. Place on a serving platter and serve with remaining Sriracha mayo and a light sprinkling of Old Bay seasoning, if desired.
