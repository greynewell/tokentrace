## Ingredients

- 2 ½ cups dried pinto beans
- 3 quarts water
- 1 ½ teaspoons chili powder
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt
- 1 pound ground beef
- ½ medium onion, chopped
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic
- 1 ⅔ cups tomato puree
- 1 tablespoon chili powder
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 1 cup dry bread crumbs

## Instructions

1. Place the beans and water in a large pot. Bring to a boil, and cook until the beans are almost tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Season with 1 1/2 teaspoons of chili powder, and 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt.
2. While the beans are cooking, crumble the ground beef into a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until onion is tender and meat is browned. Drain off excess grease, and stir in the tomato puree, 1 tablespoon chili powder, 1 tablespoon salt and bread crumbs. Stir into the pot with the beans, adding more water if needed to achieve your desired thickness. Taste and adjust seasonings if you like before serving.
