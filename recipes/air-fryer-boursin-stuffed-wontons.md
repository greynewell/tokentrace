## Ingredients

- 18  wonton wrappers
- 6 tablespoons garlic and herb cheese spread (such as Boursin®)
- water, as needed
- cooking spray

## Instructions

1. Preheat the air fryer to 325 degrees F (160 degrees C).
2. Separate the wonton wrappers and place on a clean work surface. Place 1 teaspoon of garlic and herb cheese in the center of each wonton. Use a pastry brush or your finger to wet the edges of each wonton and fold in half, pressing lightly to ensure a proper seal. Moisten the tips of the wrapper and press together. Set on a clean plate and generously spray with cooking spray.
