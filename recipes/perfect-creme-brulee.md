## Ingredients

- 3  egg yolks
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons white sugar

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Move a rack to the bottom of the oven.
2. Whisk the egg yolks, sugar, and vanilla together in a stainless steel bowl until smooth. Bring the cream just to a simmer in a saucepan over medium-low heat; pour into the egg yolk mixture, whisking continually until combined.
3. Bring a couple of inches of water to a simmer in an oven-safe saucepan over medium low heat; set the bowl with the cream mixture over the saucepan to form a double boiler.
4. Place the entire double boiler into the preheated oven; bake until the mixture sets, about 30 minutes.
5. Chill in refrigerator 2 hours.
6. Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source.
7. Combine the brown sugar with 2 tablespoons of white sugar in a bowl; sprinkle evenly over the cold creme.
8. Heat under the preheated broiler until the sugar melts and browns, 2 to 3 minutes; return immediately to the refrigerator and chill until the sugar is set, about 15 minutes.
