## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ teaspoons curry powder
- 1 dash salt
- ¼ cup margarine
- ¼ cup shortening
- ⅓ cup water
- 2 tablespoons margarine
- 1 pound ground beef
- 1 small onion, finely diced
- 1 teaspoon curry powder
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon pepper
- ½ cup beef broth
- ½ cup dry bread crumbs
- 1  egg, beaten

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Prepare pastry: Combine flour, curry powder, and salt in a bowl. Cut in margarine and shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in water until mixture forms a ball. Shape dough into a log and cut it into 10 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a 6-inch circle (approximately 1/8-inch thick) on a lightly floured surface; set aside.
3. Prepare filling: Melt margarine in a skillet over medium heat. Sauté onion until soft and translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in ground beef; season with curry powder, thyme, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring constantly, until beef is evenly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in beef broth and bread crumbs. Simmer until liquid is absorbed; remove from heat.
4. Spoon equal amounts of filling onto each pastry circle. Fold over and press edges together, making a half-circle. Use the back of a fork to seal edges, then brush tops with beaten egg. Place pastries on a baking sheet.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 30 minutes.
