## Ingredients

- 1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons black onyx cocoa powder (from Savory Spice Shop®)
- ½ cup brown sugar
- 1 ½ teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 3 tablespoons miniature semisweet chocolate chips
- ½ cup heavy cream
- 2 tablespoons heavy cream
- ½ teaspoon almond extract
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- ½ cup cherry pie filling

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Combine 1 3/4 cups plus 2 tablespoons flour, cocoa powder, brown sugar, baking powder, and salt in a bowl and mix thoroughly. Fold in chocolate chips.
3. Whisk together 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons heavy cream, almond extract, and vanilla extract in a bowl. Stir cream mixture into flour mixture with a spatula until there are large clumps. Mix in cherry pie filling. Press the dough gently and lightly into a ball, being careful not to overmix.
4. Place dough onto a large cutting board and press into a disc that is approximately 1-inch thick and 10 inches in diameter. Cut into 8 wedges and transfer to the prepared baking sheet.
5. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes, then reduce heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Rotate the baking sheet and bake until the scones have a crispy crust with a light, moist interior and the edges look dry, about 10 more minutes. Remove from the oven, transfer to a cooling rack, and cool for 15 minutes.
