## Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon dried marjoram
- 1 teaspoon dried rosemary
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder  (Optional)
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ teaspoon paprika  (Optional)
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1 (3 pound) beef chuck roast, or more to taste
- 1 pound baby red potatoes
- 4 large carrots, chopped into large chunks
- 1 large yellow onion, sliced
- 4 cups beef broth
- 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce

## Instructions

1. Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot) and select Sauté function.
2. Combine salt, marjoram, rosemary, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, and paprika in a small bowl. Rub mixture all over roast to coat all sides.
3. Drizzle oil into the preheated pot. Wait 30 seconds, then place roast into the pot; do not move the meat, allowing it to sear for 3 or 4 minutes. Turn the roast and sear again, 3 to 4 minutes. Repeat until all sides are browned, about 15 minutes total.
4. Add potatoes, carrots, and onion to the pot. Pour in broth and Worcestershire sauce. Close and lock the lid; set vent to sealing. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 60 minutes for a 3-pound roast or 80 minutes for a 5-pound roast. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
5. Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions for 10 minutes. Release remaining pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid.
6. Transfer roast, potatoes, carrots, and onions to a platter for serving.
