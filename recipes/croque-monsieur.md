## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- 2 tablespoons mayonnaise
- 4 tablespoons butter or margarine, softened
- 6 slices white bread
- 6 slices Swiss cheese
- 12 slices thinly sliced deli ham
- 4 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 2  eggs
- ¼ cup water

## Instructions

1. Use 2 tablespoons of the butter to spread over one side of each slice of bread. On three of the slices, spread a layer of Dijon mustard over the butter, and top each with 4 slices of ham. On the other three, spread mayonnaise, and top each one with 2 slices of Swiss cheese. Press ham and cheese sides of sandwiches together.
