## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.

9. Put the flour on a large plate.
10. Remove the pre-heated baking sheet from the oven and spray with cooking spray.

12. Spray the top of the chicken with cooking spray.
13. Bake for 6 minutes, turn and bake for 6 minutes more, until the chicken is cooked through and the coating is golden.
