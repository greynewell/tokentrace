## Ingredients

- 1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
- ½ cup butter
- 3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar
- 1  egg
- 9 ounces dark chocolate chips
- 2 (8 ounce) packages mascarpone cheese (such as Tre Stelle®)
- 3  eggs
- ⅔ cup white sugar
- 1 tablespoon orange liqueur (such as Grand Marnier®)

## Instructions

1. Combine flour, butter, cocoa, and confectioners' sugar in a food processor. Blend until mixture resembles fine crumbs. Add egg and blend briefly to combine into the dough.
2. Roll out crust dough on a lightly floured work surface using a lightly floured rolling pin. Place in a 8-inch tart pan with removable bottom. Prick pastry dough liberally with a fork. Chill for 1 hour.
3. While crust dough chills, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
4. Bake crust in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven and set on a wire rack to cool. Reduce oven temperature to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
5. Melt dark chocolate chips in a double boiler, about 5 minutes; remove from heat.
6. Beat mascarpone cheese, eggs, and sugar together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth. Pour in melted chocolate and orange liqueur; stir to combine. Pour filling into the prepared crust.
7. Bake in the preheated oven until set, about 40 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool before serving.
