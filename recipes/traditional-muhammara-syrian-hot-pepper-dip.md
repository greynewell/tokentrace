## Ingredients

- 2  sweet bell peppers, seeded and quartered
- 3 slices whole wheat bread, crusts removed
- ¾ cup toasted walnuts, chopped
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 2 tablespoons Aleppo pepper
- 2 teaspoons pomegranate molasses
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon cumin seeds, coarsely ground
- salt to taste
- ½ cup olive oil
- 1 pinch sumac powder

## Instructions

1. Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
2. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
3. Place the bell peppers with cut sides down onto the prepared baking sheet; roast under the preheated broiler until the skin of the peppers has blackened and blistered, 5 to 8 minutes.
4. Toast the bread slices in a toaster and let cool; place into a resealable plastic bag, squeeze out air, seal bag, and crush with a rolling pin to make crumbs.
5. Transfer peppers to a bowl and tightly seal with plastic wrap.
6. Set aside until the skins of the peppers are loose, about 15 minutes; remove and discard skins.
7. Mash the peeled peppers with a fork.
8. Combine mashed peppers, bread crumbs, walnuts, lemon juice, Aleppo pepper, pomegranate molasses, garlic, cumin, and salt in a food processor; pulse the mixture a few times to blend before running at lowest setting.
9. Slowly stream olive oil into the pepper mixture as it blends until integrated completely; transfer mixture to a serving dish.
10. Sprinkle sumac over the mixture to serve.
