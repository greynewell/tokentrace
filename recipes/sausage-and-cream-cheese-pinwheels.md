## Ingredients

- 1 pound bulk pork sausage
- 2 (8 ounce) packages refrigerated crescent rolls
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened - divided

## Instructions

1. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes; drain and discard grease.
2. Spread dough from 1 package of crescent rolls out onto a work surface and pinch perforations together to create a single sheet of dough. Spread half the cream cheese over the dough sheet, leaving a 1/2-inch margin all around. Sprinkle half the cooked sausage evenly over cream cheese. Roll dough up into a log, starting at a long edge; wrap log in plastic wrap or parchment paper. Repeat steps to make a second roll; wrap. Refrigerate rolls at least 1 hour.
3. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
4. Unwrap rolls and cut each into 1/2-inch thick slices. Place slices onto a baking sheet.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until pinwheels are golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes.
