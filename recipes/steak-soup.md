## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 ½ pounds lean boneless beef round steak, cut into cubes
- ½ cup chopped onion
- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon paprika
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 4 cups beef broth
- 2 cups water
- 4 sprigs fresh parsley, chopped
- 2 tablespoons chopped celery leaves
- 1  bay leaf
- ½ teaspoon dried marjoram
- 1 ½ cups peeled, diced Yukon Gold potatoes
- 1 ½ cups sliced carrots
- 1 ½ cups chopped celery
- 1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
- 1 (15.25 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained

## Instructions

1. Melt butter and oil in a large skillet over medium heat until the foam disappears from butter. Cook and stir beef and onion in butter-oil mixture until browned, about 10 minutes.
2. While beef is cooking, mix together flour, paprika, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Sprinkle flour mixture over browned beef; stir to coat and set aside.
3. Pour beef broth and water into a large soup pot. Stir in parsley, celery leaves, bay leaf, and marjoram. Stir in beef mixture; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover the pot, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until meat is tender, about 45 minutes.
4. Mix in corn, potatoes, carrots, celery, and tomato paste. Bring to a simmer and cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are tender and soup is thick, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove bay leaf and serve hot.
