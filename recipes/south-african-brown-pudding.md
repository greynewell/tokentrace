## Ingredients

- 2 cups white sugar
- 4  eggs
- 2 cups flour

## Instructions

1. Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Beat 2 cups sugar and eggs with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Stir in the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, vinegar, and apricot jam. Pour in 2 cups of milk and stir until well combined. Spoon the batter into a greased, 2 quart oven-proof baking dish.
