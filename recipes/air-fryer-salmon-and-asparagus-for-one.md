## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon honey
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
- ⅛ teaspoon ground paprika
- ⅛ teaspoon salt
- ⅛ teaspoon black pepper
- 1 (6 ounce) fillet salmon fillet, thawed if frozen and patted dry
- ½ pound fresh asparagus, trimmed

## Instructions

1. Stir together honey, olive oil, mustard, paprika, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Whisk well to form a slightly thick sauce.
2. Brush about 1/2 of the marinade all over both sides of the salmon fillet and place it into the air fryer basket. Air-fry at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 4 minutes.
3. Open the basket and place the asparagus around the fillet as best you can, being careful not to cover it. Brush remaining sauce all over the asparagus and on top of the salmon fillet.
4. Air-fry at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) until salmon is cooked through and asparagus is tender, 6 to 7 more minutes.
