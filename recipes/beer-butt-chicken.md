## Ingredients

- 1 cup butter
- 2 tablespoons garlic salt
- 2 tablespoons paprika
- salt and pepper to taste
- 1 (12 fluid ounce) can beer
- 1 (4 pound) whole chicken

## Instructions

1. Preheat an outdoor grill for low heat and lightly oil the grate.
2. Melt 1/2 cup butter in a small skillet. Mix in 1 tablespoon garlic salt, 1 tablespoon paprika, salt, and pepper.
3. Discard 1/2 of the beer, leaving the remainder in the can. Add remaining butter, garlic salt, paprika, salt, and pepper to the beer can. Place the can on a baking sheet or disposable pan. Set chicken upright on the beer can, inserting the can into the cavity of the chicken. Baste chicken with melted, seasoned butter.
4. Place the baking sheet with beer and chicken on the preheated grill. Cook over low heat until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 3 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
5. Remove from the grill, cover with a doubled sheet of aluminum foil, and allow to rest in a warm area for 10 minutes before slicing.
