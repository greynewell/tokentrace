## Ingredients

- ¼ cup chicken broth
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- ¼ cup heavy cream
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 (6 ounce) can crab
- 1 (6 ounce) can salad shrimp
- ¼ cup heavy cream
- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
- 1 dash nutmeg
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 4  eggs, beaten
- ¼ cup heavy cream
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Make filling: Stir together chicken broth and mustard in a saucepan until well combined. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, then add cream and butter. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until reduced by half. Stir in crab and shrimp; keep warm over low heat.
2. Make sauce: Stir together cream and mustard in a small pot over medium heat until hot. Whisk in Cheddar cheese until smooth. Season with nutmeg, salt, and pepper; keep warm over low heat.
3. Prepare omelets: Grease an 8-inch nonstick skillet with cooking spray and place over medium heat. Whisk together eggs, cream, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl until smooth.
4. Pour about 1/4 cup egg mixture into the hot pan; swirl to make a thin, even layer of egg. Cook until firm, then flip and cook for a few more seconds to firm the other side. Spoon 1/6 of the seafood filling onto the lower half of omelet, then roll up into a cylinder. Repeat this step with remaining egg mixture.
5. Serve 2 omelets smothered in cheese sauce per person.
