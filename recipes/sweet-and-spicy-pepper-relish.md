## Ingredients

- 1 pound medium-hot red chile peppers, such as Fresnos or red jalapenos
- 2 small red or orange bell peppers - stemmed, seeded, ribs removed
- ½ large onion, peeled and quartered
- 1 ¼ cups white sugar
- ¾ cup apple cider vinegar
- 1 ½ teaspoons pickling salt

## Instructions

1. Wearing rubber or latex gloves, trim tops off chiles. Working in batches, pulse chiles, bell peppers, and onion in a food processor until chopped into fine bits, about 1 minute per batch. Transfer to a nonreactive 3-quart pot.
2. Stir sugar, vinegar, and salt into chile mixture and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium and simmer, stirring more frequently toward end of cooking to prevent scorching, until thickened, 20 to 30 minutes.
3. Pour or ladle relish into clean, wide-mouth, half-pint jars, leaving 1/2 inch headspace. Wipe rims clean with a damp paper towel. Let cool to room temperature, about 1 hour.
4. Apply clean lids. Enjoy immediately, store in fridge 2 to 3 weeks, or freeze up to 6 months.
