## Ingredients

- 3 slices bacon
- 1 (1 pound) loaf round sourdough bread
- 8 (1 ounce) slices Cheddar cheese, or more as needed
- ½ cup butter, melted
- 1 tablespoon dry ranch dressing mix

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

4. Cut slits halfway through bread in two directions creating a checkerboard pattern.
5. Slip Cheddar cheese slices and bacon pieces into the slits.
6. Mix butter and ranch dressing mix together in a small bowl; pour over bread, allowing to drip into the slits.
