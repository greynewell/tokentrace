## Ingredients

- ¾ cup milk
- 3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh lavender
- 6 tablespoons butter, softened
- 1 cup white sugar
- 2  eggs
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ teaspoons baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon salt

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x5 inch loaf pan.
2. Combine the milk and lavender in a small saucepan over medium heat. Heat to a simmer, then remove from heat, and allow to cool slightly.
3. In a medium bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until smooth. Beat in the egg until the mixture is light and fluffy. Combine the flour, baking powder, and salt; stir into the creamed mixture alternately with the milk and lavender until just blended. Pour into the prepared pan.
4. Bake for 50 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a wooden pick inserted into the crown of the loaf comes out clean. Cool in the pan on a wire rack.
