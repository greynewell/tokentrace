## Ingredients

- 1 large sweet onion, roughly chopped
- 1 medium green bell pepper, roughly chopped
- 1 medium red bell pepper, roughly chopped
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 medium carrot, shredded
- 1 small zucchini, shredded
- 2 cups reduced-sodium vegetable broth
- 1 cup dry red lentils, rinsed and drained
- 2 (14.5 ounce) cans diced tomatoes
