## Ingredients

- 2  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- ¼ cup crumbled Gorgonzola cheese
- 2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley
- 2 tablespoons minced shallot
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 4  thick slices of applewood smoked bacon
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray an 8x8-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
2. Using a sharp knife, cut a slit into the thick side of each chicken breast, about 2 inches long and 1 1/2 inches deep.
3. Mash together Gorgonzola cheese, parsley, shallot, and garlic in a small bowl; season with salt and black pepper. Fill each chicken breast pocket with Gorgonzola mixture. Wrap 2 slices bacon around each breast; secure with wooden toothpicks. Place chicken breasts into the prepared baking dish.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until bacon is browned and chicken is no longer pink inside, about 35 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a breast should read at least 165 degrees F (75 degrees C).
