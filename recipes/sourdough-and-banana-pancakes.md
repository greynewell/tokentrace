## Ingredients

- ¾ cup all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ tablespoons white sugar
- ¾ teaspoon baking soda
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1  ripe banana
- ½ cup sourdough starter
- ½ cup sour cream
- 1  egg, lightly beaten
- 2 tablespoons butter, softened
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- ½ cup milk, or as needed
- 1 tablespoon butter, melted, divided

## Instructions

1. Whisk flour, sugar, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon together in a large bowl.
2. Mash banana in another bowl. Stir in sourdough starter, sour cream, egg, 2 tablespoons butter, and vanilla extract. Add to the flour mixture and stir until just combined. Mix in milk gradually until batter is pourable but some lumps remain.
3. Heat a griddle over medium-high heat. Grease lightly with melted butter. Pour 1/4 cup batter onto the griddle for each pancake, keeping them 2 inches apart. Cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 1/2 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, about 1 minute. Repeat with remaining butter and batter.
