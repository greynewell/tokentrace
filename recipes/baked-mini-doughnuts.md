## Ingredients

- ⅔ cup all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg, or more to taste
- ⅛ teaspoon salt
- ¼ cup milk
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- 5 tablespoons softened butter
- ⅓ cup white sugar
- 1  egg
- ⅓ cup white sugar
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease miniature muffin cups or line with paper liners.
2. Make the doughnuts: Whisk flour, baking powder, nutmeg, and salt together in a bowl. Stir milk and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl. Beat butter and sugar together in a third bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy; beat in egg.
3. Stir flour mixture, alternating with milk mixture, into butter mixture until batter is smooth. Spoon batter into a piping bag and pipe into muffin cups, about 2/3-full.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 10 to 12 minutes.
5. Meanwhile, make the coating: Mix sugar and cinnamon together in a bowl; add warm doughnuts and gently toss with hands until coated.
