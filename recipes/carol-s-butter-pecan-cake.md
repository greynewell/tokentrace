## Ingredients

- 1 ¼ cups butter
- 2 cups chopped pecans
- 3 cups sifted all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 2 cups white sugar
- 4  eggs
- 1 cup milk
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- ¼ cup butter
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 4 cups sifted confectioners' sugar
- ⅓ cup heavy whipping cream

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour three 9-inch layer pans.
2. Melt 1/4 cup butter in a heavy skillet over medium heat. Add pecans; cook and stir until browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Set aside.
3. Sift flour, baking powder, and 1/2 teaspoon salt; set aside.
4. Cream 1 cup butter and 2 cups white sugar in a large mixing bowl until light and fluffy. Blend in eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add flour mixture alternately with milk and vanilla extract, beginning and ending with dry ingredients. Blend well after each addition. Fold in 1 1/3 cups pecans. Pour batter into the prepared pans.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until cake is golden brown and springs back when lightly touched in center, 25 to 30 minutes. When cake is cool, blend remaining 2/3 cup pecans with frosting; spread between layers and on top.
6. Cream 1/4 cup butter in a mixing bowl. Add 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 4 cups confectioners' sugar, and 1/3 to 1/2 cup cream. Beat until smooth and spreadable. Thin with additional cream if needed.
